### Analysis

CONFIRMED: Charlie Kirk was assassinated on September 10, 2025 in Utah. Multiple sources (Newsweek, Megyn Kelly podcast) confirm that Erika Kirk contacted a friend (identified by Megyn Kelly as a Catholic priest) to come pray with them over Charlie the night before (Sept 9, 2025). Previous verdict was based on outdated information showing Kirk alive (pre-Sept 2025 training data). The claim accurately describes what Erika said happened.

**Confidence:** High
