## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This claim describes specific actions by unnamed donors (demanding name removal from a building, then reversing after Kirk's death). The speaker indicates she received this information from contacts ('I'm being contacted by a lot of people'). Without access to internal Turning Point USA communications, donor correspondence, or named sources willing to go on record, this cannot be independently verified through public sources.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify through Turning Point announcements or donor communications
