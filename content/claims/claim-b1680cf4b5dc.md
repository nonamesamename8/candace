### Analysis

This claim is false regarding the timeline. While Utah Valley University did repave/clean the shooting site, this occurred around September 29, 2025 - approximately 19 days after the September 10 shooting, not within 48 hours as claimed. The university confirmed the repaving, and fact-checkers noted that cleaning a crime scene after evidence collection is standard protocol. The '48 hours' timeline appears to be an exaggeration or error. Sources: MEAWW fact-check article, Joe Hoft article documenting the cleanup.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Footage or records of repaving at UVU site
