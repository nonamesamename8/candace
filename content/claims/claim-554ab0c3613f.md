## Verification

### Analysis

This claim refers to transponder data for a specific flight of an Egyptian military plane (tail number SUBTU) carrying someone named Walid Mahmood to Provo, Utah on May 27, 2019. While flight tracking websites like FlightAware and ADS-B Exchange do track aircraft with tail number SU-BTT/SUBTT, publicly available sources do not contain specific transponder data for this particular May 2019 flight. The absence of transponder data could mean: (1) the transponder was turned off, (2) the flight occurred but wasn't tracked publicly, (3) the data has been removed, or (4) the flight didn't occur as described. Without access to proprietary aviation databases or official investigation records, this specific claim about missing transponder data for this particular historical flight cannot be independently verified.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Search FlightRadar24 for SUBTU on May 27th
