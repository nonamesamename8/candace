### Analysis

Reliable news sources, including the New York Daily News and Yahoo News, confirm Joe Gebbia donated $2 million to super PACs supporting Andrew Cuomo in opposition to Zohran Mamdani in the 2025 NYC mayoral race. Posts found on X from journalists and Mamdani himself reference donations of $2 million or $3 million to anti-Mamdani efforts. No sources confirm the exact figure of $3.1 million, making the specific amount inaccurate, but the claim of a significant donation to stop Mamdani is supported by evidence.

**Confidence:** Medium
