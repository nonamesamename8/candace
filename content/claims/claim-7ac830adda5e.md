> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

The claim mixes accurate and inaccurate timing. Tyler Robinson was taken into custody on Sept 11, 2025, but not at 7pm - official sources confirm he was arrested at approximately 10pm at the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Hurricane, Utah. The 'Warner Valley' location is approximate - Robinson's parents lived in Washington, Utah (near Warner Valley area in Washington County). Local texts may have circulated around 7pm about the suspect being identified, but the actual arrest occurred at 10pm, making the total manhunt 33 hours from the shooting.

**Confidence:** Medium
