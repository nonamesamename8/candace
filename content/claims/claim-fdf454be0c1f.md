### Analysis

No public documentation found confirming FBI release of 'Lance' or drop-off at parents' home. Wikipedia, FBI press releases, and news coverage of the Charlie Kirk assassination identify Tyler Robinson as the suspect, with no mention of a person named 'Lance' being questioned, detained, or released. The claim appears to reference unverified or private information not corroborated by official sources.

**Confidence:** High
