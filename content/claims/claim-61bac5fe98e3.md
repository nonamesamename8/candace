### Analysis

This is a firsthand eyewitness account from the speaker describing what they personally observed in footage of the Charlie Kirk shooting aftermath. The claim states they did not see blood on Charlie Kirk's back, only on his left hand. This is unverifiable because: 1) It is a subjective observation about private footage that was not publicly released, 2) The speaker explicitly stated they promised not to share the footage, 3) Without access to the actual footage, independent verification is impossible, 4) Eyewitness accounts of what someone personally saw cannot be fact-checked without the underlying evidence.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Eyewitness footage or autopsy reports
