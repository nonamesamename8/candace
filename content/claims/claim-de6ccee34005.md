### Analysis

This claim states that 'the feds' never reached out to an unnamed individual until September 15th, after Governor Cox said the investigation was over. The claim is based on what this unnamed person allegedly told the speaker. Without identifying who this person is, and without access to FBI investigation records or official timelines, this cannot be independently verified. While the broader context about FBI investigation timing issues has been publicly discussed, this specific claim about when the feds contacted this particular individual relies on secondhand testimony about private communications with law enforcement.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify timeline of federal outreach and Governor Cox's statement
