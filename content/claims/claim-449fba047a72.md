### Analysis

Candace Owens stated on her podcast (Episode 243) that journalists and forensic accountants have been hired and shown preliminary findings. According to Newsworthy Women reporting, Owens claims 'outside journalists have engaged forensic accountants' and that she's 'not exactly a forensic accountant' but knows journalists 'who were similarly receiving leaks and have pushed this off to forensic accountants.' However, these are CLAIMS about hiring investigators, not verified independent confirmation. TPUSA has disputed these allegations, with producer Blake Neff stating 'none of it ever pans out, because from the start, there has been nothing there.' The claim reflects what Owens has publicly stated, but independent verification of forensic accountants being hired and their findings is not available. This is a self-reported claim.
