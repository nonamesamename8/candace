### Analysis

Unverifiable. No credible sources confirm this specific claim about video provenance. Extensive reporting on the Butler shooting includes bodycam footage of police officers and videos of Crooks at the rally, but no mainstream sources mention a video of 'the shooter running away after the shot' recorded by 'someone in the ROTC' and sent 'through three people.' FBI and police bodycam footage shows aftermath scenes, but this specific claim about ROTC involvement and video chain-of-custody cannot be verified through reliable sources. This appears to be speculation or alternative narrative not supported by official investigations.

**Confidence:** Low
