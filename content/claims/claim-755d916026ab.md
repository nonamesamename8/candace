### Analysis

Unverifiable personal recollection. This is Candace Owens' personal statement about recognizing someone from footage of the Charlie Kirk shooting - someone she says worked at Turning Point USA in early days when she was there. This is a subjective personal memory claim about her own employment history and acquaintances. There is no way to independently verify her personal memories of knowing this individual from years ago at Turning Point USA. While factual in the sense that it describes her recollection, it cannot be objectively verified through external sources.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify through Turning Point USA records or public associations
