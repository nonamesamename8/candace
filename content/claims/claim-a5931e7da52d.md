### Analysis

The claim states someone cheered at 'that university' when Charlie was shot. Context indicates this refers to Utah Valley University (UVU) where Kirk was assassinated on September 10, 2025. Extensive news coverage describes the moment of shooting: audience members 'gasped, exhaled for a beat, then rose up in screams of horror.' The cheering mentioned in accounts occurred moments BEFORE the shooting, in response to Kirk's debate quip. No credible sources document anyone cheering after the shooting occurred. The claim as stated is false.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify reports or footage from the university event where Charlie Kirk was shot.
