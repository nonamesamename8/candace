### Analysis

This is a conspiracy theory promoted by Candace Owens and others. The claim that Brigitte Macron was born male as Jean-Michel Trogneux is demonstrably false. Jean-Michel Trogneux is Brigitte's 80-year-old brother who lives in Amiens and has appeared publicly with her at Emmanuel Macron's presidential inaugurations. Birth records, childhood photos, communion photos, and first wedding photos all confirm Brigitte Macron was born female. French courts found purveyors of this theory guilty of libel (though later overturned on appeal). The Macrons sued Owens for defamation in Delaware in July 2025.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verification through official records or investigations into Trogneux's background
