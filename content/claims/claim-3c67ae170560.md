### Analysis

The claim states 'Shulman' demanded name removal from TPUSA building in 48 hours before assassination. The Grayzone reported that Robert Shillman (not Shulman - misspelling) cancelled plans for his name plaque at TPUSA and terminated funding. However, Shillman announced this at an AFA dinner on Sept 6, 2025 - which is 4 days (not 48 hours) before Kirk's Sept 10 assassination. The core facts are substantially true but details are imprecise: wrong name spelling and wrong timeframe.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verifiable via statements or records from TPUSA
