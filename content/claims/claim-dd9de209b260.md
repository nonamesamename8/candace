### Analysis

False: The timeline is reversed. Bari Weiss founded The Free Press in 2021 after leaving The New York Times. She then went TO CBS News in October 2025 (after founding The Free Press), not before. CBS/Paramount acquired The Free Press for ~50 million and made Weiss editor-in-chief of CBS News. The claim incorrectly states she went to CBS News before founding The Free Press.

**Confidence:** High
