### Analysis

This claim involves two unverifiable elements: (1) a private hospital conversation on September 10, 2025 between Charlie Kirk and Owens about a 'list', and (2) the existence of such a list with specific names on it. While Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025 is confirmed by multiple sources (Wikipedia, NBC News, CNN), the specific conversation about a list is Owens' personal account that cannot be independently verified through public sources.

**Confidence:** High
