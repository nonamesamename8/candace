### Analysis

Unverifiable allegation. This claim represents what Tyler Robinson's family believes happened after his arrest - specifically that a 'furry bed' was placed in his room to frame him. While multiple news sources report that Candace Owens made these claims about the family's beliefs (AOL, X/Twitter posts), there is no independent evidence to verify whether the apartment was actually staged. Prosecutors have dismissed staging theories as 'baseless' and state they have 'substantial' evidence of Robinson's guilt. This is an unverified family allegation reported in media, not an established fact.
