MIXED: Tucker Carlson investigation found extensive violent online history including calls for assassinations, searches for mass shooting locations, and discussions of terrorism-style attacks. However, claim about 'posting videos of himself practicing firing a weapon in his bedroom' not confirmed in available sources. FBI Director Wray stated they found no clear online trail pointing to motive, contradicting this reporting.
