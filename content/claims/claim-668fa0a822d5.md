### Analysis

This claim is TRUE. Charlie Kirk was indeed taken to Timpanogos Regional Hospital after being shot on September 10, 2025 at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Timpanogos Regional Hospital is confirmed to be a Level III Trauma Center according to Utah Department of Health records. The claim accurately describes it as 'a smaller regional hospital' and a 'trauma III center.' Level III trauma centers can provide initial care for moderately severe injuries but typically transfer more severely injured patients to Level I or II centers. Kirk was shot in the neck, which would be considered a serious trauma.
