### Analysis

Kirk flew into Salt Lake City the morning of September 10, 2025 to conduct an interview at the Restaurantology Summit with Andrew K. Smith of Savory Fund. The interview took place approximately 40 minutes to 1 hour before the shooting at UVU in Orem. Provo Airport is indeed closer to UVU/Orem than Salt Lake City Airport. The interview was conducted in Salt Lake City, which explains why Kirk flew there instead of the closer Provo airport. Sources: Salt Lake Tribune, Fox News, Andrew K. Smith X statement.

**Confidence:** High
