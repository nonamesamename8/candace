## Verification

**Confidence:** Low
**Source:** [January 6 United States Capitol attack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack)

### Analysis

No primary sources, established news outlets, or official documents were found confirming that exactly fifteen pastors and leaders surrounded Donald Trump at the White House before the January 6 Stop the Steal rally to discuss spiritual warfare. Posts found on X mention 15 NAR apostles and prophets meeting with high-level Trump administration officials on December 29, 2020, but this information is inconclusive for a controversial topic, does not specify the location as the White House, and does not confirm direct interaction with Trump himself. The cited Wikipedia page provides general context on January 6 events but lacks details on this specific claim. To verify, access to White House visitor logs from late December 2020, FOIA-requested documents from the Trump administration, or firsthand accounts from participants (e.g., via investigative reports or books by experts like Matthew D. Taylor) would be needed.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** White House visitor logs or photos/articles on Trump meeting with pastors pre-Jan 6
