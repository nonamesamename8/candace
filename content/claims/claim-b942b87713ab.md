### Analysis

Web research confirms that approximately 15-20 NAR apostles and prophets were mobilized by White House officials after the 2020 election and conducted rallies in swing states leading up to January 6. Cindy Jacobs spent nearly 3 hours at the White House on January 5, 2021. However, the specific claim about '15 pastors surrounding Trump at the White House' is not precisely documented. The meetings and White House access are confirmed, but the exact number and specific 'surrounding' scenario is partially supported rather than fully verified.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up
