### Analysis

This claim quotes Benjamin Netanyahu's statement denying Israel's involvement in Charlie Kirk's assassination. Netanyahu did make such a statement, posted on X (Twitter), where he called the allegations a 'monstrous big lie' and stated 'This is insane. It is false. It is outrageous.' The quote is accurate. Netanyahu released this statement in response to conspiracy theories circulating on social media, particularly from figures like Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, and others. No law enforcement official has suggested Israeli involvement; the FBI charged only 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with the murder.
