### Analysis

This claim references reports about Charlie Kirk not being buried. While there are indeed viral reports and speculation about Kirk's burial site (FindAGrave lists it as 'Burial Details Unknown'), these are unconfirmed reports rather than established facts. The claim itself is about the existence of these reports going viral, which is true, but the underlying assertion (that he hasn't been buried) cannot be verified as the family has not disclosed the burial location.

**Confidence:** High
