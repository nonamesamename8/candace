### Analysis

JFK's administration (specifically AG Robert F. Kennedy) did pressure the American Zionist Council to register under FARA in Nov 1962. Senate hearings in 1963 under Fulbright revealed Israel lobbying. JFK was assassinated Nov 22, 1963, before enforcement completed. The claim about 'before he was shot' is technically accurate but implies causation.
