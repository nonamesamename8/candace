### Analysis

Netanyahu confirmed on X (Sep 10, 2025) that he invited Kirk to Israel 2 weeks before death and 'that visit will not take place' - but did not confirm Kirk explicitly declined. The Grayzone reports anonymous source saying Kirk rejected Netanyahu funding offer and 'loathed' him. Conflicting accounts about whether Kirk formally declined.

**Confidence:** Medium
