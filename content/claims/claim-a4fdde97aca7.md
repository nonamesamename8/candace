## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

Utah has Special Event Medical Guidelines that require medical plans for events meeting permit thresholds, but no specific statute requiring ambulance standby was found. Utah law addresses ambulance licensing (§26B-4-119) and ground ambulance rates, but search did not reveal a specific law mandating ambulance presence at all university public events. The claim is too specific to verify without access to complete Utah administrative codes and local ordinances applicable to UVU events.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Utah event security laws and rally records
