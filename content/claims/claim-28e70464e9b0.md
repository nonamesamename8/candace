### Analysis

A fact-check article and other news reports from reliable outlets like The Times of Israel and Israel Hayom confirm that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended a personal invitation to Charlie Kirk to visit Israel shortly before his death in September 2025. While some sources attribute a similar invitation to Minister Amichai Chikli for a January conference, the fact-check specifically verifies Netanyahu's involvement, supporting the claim of a conversation and invitation a few weeks prior. The exact details of the 'speech' (e.g., phone call vs. other communication) are not contradicted but not fully detailed in all sources, leading to medium confidence.

**Confidence:** Medium
