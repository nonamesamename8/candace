### Analysis

Confirmed FALSE. This is a conspiracy theory promoted by Candace Owens without credible evidence. While Owens claimed 12 Israeli cell phones and French Foreign Legionnaires were present at the Kirk assassination, these claims lack credible verification. France's Ministry of Armed Forces explicitly denied Tyler Robinson was ever a member of the French Foreign Legion. Regarding the cell phones, reports indicate NSA may have detected 12 foreign-registered phones, but confirmation they were Israeli is absent from reliable sources - characterized as 'unverified conspiracy theories' by fact-checkers. No credible evidence supports National Guard involvement either.
