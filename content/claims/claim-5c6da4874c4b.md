### Analysis

Netanyahu stated in interviews after Kirk's death that he invited Kirk to Israel and that 'sadly that visit will not take place,' but did not explicitly say whether Kirk accepted or declined. Bill Ackman denied Owens' claims about the nature of the invitation. The specific claim that Kirk 'declined to go' cannot be independently verified from public sources, though various parties dispute the characterization of events.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Confirmable via communications or statements from Charlie Kirk or involved parties
