### Analysis

This claim asserts specific transponder timestamps for Egyptian military plane SU-BND at Duncan Aviation on September 10th. Without access to ADS-B Exchange historical data or Duncan Aviation maintenance records, this cannot be independently verified. While the speaker claims to have found this data on ADS-B Exchange, third parties cannot verify these specific timestamps without the same access.

**Confidence:** High
