### Analysis

This claim is a subjective statement about personal experience with lawfare rather than a verifiable factual assertion. The speaker is describing their belief that they are being subjected to constant lawsuits as a strategy. While lawfare as a tactic exists and is documented, whether this specific individual is being targeted in this way is a matter of personal experience and interpretation, not an independently verifiable fact.

**Confidence:** High
