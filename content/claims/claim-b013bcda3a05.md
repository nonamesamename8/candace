### Analysis

Verified as MIXED. The claim conflates terminology and regulations. Brian Harpole stated he 'can't fly it' because 'the area lies in the Provo, Utah airspace' and referenced '107B' as a restriction. However, FAA drone regulations are codified under 'Part 107' (14 CFR Part 107), not 'Part 107B.' Subpart B of Part 107 deals with operating rules and airspace restrictions requiring ATC authorization in Class B, C, D, and E controlled airspace. The Provo area likely has controlled airspace restrictions near airports requiring LAANC authorization. While Harpole's core point about airspace restrictions preventing unauthorized drone flights is accurate, the specific regulation reference '107B' as stated is imprecise. The claim accurately reflects operational restrictions but uses non-standard regulatory terminology. Sources: FAA Part 107 regulations, UVU drone policy, UAV Coach Utah laws.

**Confidence:** Medium
