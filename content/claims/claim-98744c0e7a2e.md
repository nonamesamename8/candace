### Analysis

Multiple news sources, including Soap Central and Times of India, report Candace Owens' claim that she viewed private footage from behind Charlie Kirk showing no blood or gore. However, the footage has not been publicly released, and no independent verification from official sources (e.g., forensic reports or law enforcement) confirms or refutes what it depicts. Verification would require public release of the footage, an official autopsy report detailing wound ballistics, or FOIA-requested documents from the FBI or local authorities investigating the September 10, 2025, shooting.

**Confidence:** High
