### Analysis

REVIEWING TRANSCRIPT CONTEXT: The speaker claims Egyptian military men were 'on the ground' on September 10th. Evidence shows: (1) An Egyptian Air Force plane (SU-BTT) departed Provo at 7:08 AM MDT, BEFORE the shooting at 12:23 PM; (2) Candace Owens claims via whistleblower that the plane dropped off 'military subcontractors' - this is unconfirmed; (3) The plane was at Duncan Aviation for maintenance Sept 4-10; (4) No official sources confirm Egyptian military personnel were physically present on the ground. VERACITY: The Egyptian plane WAS in Provo and departed Sept 10, but left hours BEFORE the assassination, not after. The claim Egyptian military 'men' were 'on the ground' is unverified - based solely on anonymous whistleblower to Owens claiming subcontractors were dropped off. Marking as MIXED because plane presence is confirmed but personnel on ground is unverified claim.
