### Analysis

The claim about Egyptian aircraft tracking TPUSA Faith events is an unverified allegation made by Candace Owens. While alternative media sources report these claims, mainstream news coverage of the Charlie Kirk shooting does not corroborate the existence or tracking of Egyptian military aircraft. No official sources (FBI, Pentagon, etc.) have confirmed these allegations. The claim appears in podcasts and alternative media but lacks independent verification from credible aviation tracking, military, or government sources.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Check flight tracking data
