### Analysis

CLAIM IS FALSE: Rob McCoy was Chairman of the Board and CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of Potter's Field Ministries in 2019, NOT the CFO. Multiple sources confirm he served as CEO and Board Chairman when he took over to dissolve the ministry after the Rozells resigned. A 'new CFO' is mentioned in reports but was not Rob McCoy. Sources: Montana Public Radio, Flathead Beacon, Phoenix Preacher.
