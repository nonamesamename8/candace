### Analysis

The Grayzone and other outlets confirmed Bill Ackman hosted a Hamptons meeting where Kirk was confronted about Israel views, with attendees reporting it was contentious. Reports confirm Netanyahu involvement and funding offers to TPUSA which Kirk rejected. However, Ackman publicly denied making threats or blackmail attempts, publishing friendly text exchanges with Kirk. Witness accounts vary - some describe 'screaming' and Kirk feeling 'blackmailed,' others describe 'spirited but amicable' discussions. The meeting occurred and involved Israel pressure, but characterization as threatening 'intervention' with 'threats made' is disputed.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Statements from Bill Ackman, Seth Dillon, or text messages
