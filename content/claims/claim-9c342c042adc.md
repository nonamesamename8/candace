### Analysis

Charlie Kirk did meet Rush Limbaugh and greatly admired him. According to Limbaugh's January 11, 2018 radio broadcast, they met for the first time in December 2017 when Kirk was brought to Limbaugh's golf course in South Florida for a Turning Point USA conference. Kirk told Limbaugh he 'grew up in a home where my program was on all the time' and was 'effusively complimentary.' Kirk began listening to Rush during high school. The claim that Limbaugh was the person Kirk 'adored the most' and 'never thought he would meet' aligns with documented accounts of their relationship. Multiple sources confirm Kirk's deep admiration for Limbaugh.

**Confidence:** High
