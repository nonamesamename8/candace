## Claim

> in 2024, legislation was passed which would provide financial support to the Longwood Foundation, a philanthropic nonprofit that was founded by Pierre S. du Pont to make it function as a quote-unquote educational center. There's just one problem with that. Pierre S. du Pont was a member of the French-American family du Pont, which was descended from Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours—a French aristocrat. DuPont also has extreme ties to both the American and the French military
