### Analysis

Confirmed. T.W. Lewis is an Arizona real estate developer who founded the T.W. Lewis Company and Foundation. Multiple sources confirm Lewis is a donor to Turning Point USA and other conservative organizations. Lewis previously funded the T.W. Lewis Center at ASU Barrett Honors College, which closed after controversy over an event featuring Charlie Kirk and Dennis Prager. Regarding the specific plane flight from Scottsdale to Provo on the morning of the shooting, flight records show a plane departed Scottsdale morning Sept 10 and landed Provo 10:06am, though ownership connection to Lewis requires additional verification.

**Confidence:** High
