### Analysis

No reliable primary sources (e.g., news articles from established outlets like Daily Mail, People, or Yahoo News, or official flight records) confirm or refute the existence of a specific plane departing Scottsdale at 8 a.m. local time and landing in Provo at 10 a.m. local time on September 10, 2025, owned by T.W. Lewis. Available web results focus on a different plane departing Provo after the shooting, with ownership unmasked in some reports, but not matching the claimed route or timing. X posts mention a morning flight linked to a TPUSA donor but are inconclusive and not reliable evidence. Verification would require public or FOIA-accessible flight records from FAA, FlightAware, or similar aviation databases to check registrations under T.W. Lewis or associated entities for that date and route.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Flight logs for plane owned by T.W. Lewis Foundation landing Provo on September 10th
