### Analysis

This claim alleges that Egyptian military subcontractors on a plane 'did not make it back to Cairo' and were 'mysteriously missing' after departing Provo. While there is documented evidence of an Egyptian Air Force plane (tail SU-BTT) at Provo on Sept 4-10, 2025, departing to Wilmington DE on Sept 10, no official sources (FBI, Egyptian government, aviation authorities) have confirmed passenger manifests, missing persons, or any investigation into missing Egyptian military personnel. The claim relies solely on anonymous whistleblower sources cited by Candace Owens. Without official verification of passenger lists or missing persons reports, this remains unverifiable despite the plane movements being documented.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Passenger manifests for SUBTT departure from Provo on September 10, 2025
