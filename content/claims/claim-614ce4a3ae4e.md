### Analysis

CLAIM ANALYSIS: This claim has two parts - (1) that Googling 'FBI Wilmington Resident Agency' shows 920 North King Street in Google's info panel, and (2) that this address is labeled as FBI. FINDINGS: The official FBI Wilmington address is 500 Delaware Ave Suite 300. 920 North King Street is publicly listed as Richards, Layton & Finger law firm (One Rodney Square). Public records show no FBI/DHS/DEA offices at 920 N King St. However, I cannot directly test current Google info panel results. The speaker claims Google shows this address and that it appears in DOJ 1990s directories, but I found no evidence of historical FBI presence at 920 N King St. VERACITY: Mixed - the official FBI address is 500 Delaware Ave (confirmed), but the specific claim about Google's info panel showing 920 N King St could not be independently verified or refuted. Federal agencies sometimes have multiple locations in buildings not publicly listed.
