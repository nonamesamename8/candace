### Analysis

While Candace Owens has publicly claimed that the French President paid .5 million for her assassination, she has provided no credible evidence to support this allegation. French authorities (National Gendarmerie Intervention Group) have stated these allegations are false. Multiple news sources report Owens made this claim but without evidence. The claim as stated uses 'allegedly,' acknowledging it is unverified. This remains an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that cannot be independently verified.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Examine financial records or intelligence reports related to alleged payments
