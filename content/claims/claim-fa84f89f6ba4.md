## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This claim is partially verified. George Zinn was indeed arrested after falsely confessing to shooting Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University on September 10, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the shooting occurred 'shortly after 12:20 p.m.' and that Zinn was taken into custody after shouting 'I shot him, now shoot me.' However, the specific time of '12:52' for the custody announcement could not be independently verified through available sources. The core facts are true (Zinn arrested, suspect in custody announced), but the precise timestamp of 12:52 remains unverified.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Police reports or announcements on suspect custody.
