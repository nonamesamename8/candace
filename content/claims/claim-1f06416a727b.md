## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

Mixed: Multiple sources report a bullet/fragment was found 'just beneath the skin' per Andrew Kolvet (TPUSA spokesman) quoting the coroner. However, fact-checking sources note no confirmed autopsy or forensic chain-of-custody documentation proving the bullet was formally recovered, cataloged, and ballistically matched as evidence.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Medical examiner's report or death certificate
