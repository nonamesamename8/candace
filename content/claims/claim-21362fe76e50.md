## Claim

> I'm pretty convinced that Brigitte Macron has been involved, on the basis of my lawsuit and the mentioning of MKUltra 18 times absurdly in my lawsuit, even though all we said was, hey, Brigitte's fake birthday happens to be the same day as the MKUltra program, I'm thinking there might be something there. Like Brigitte is involved in the military files; Jean-Michel Trogneux is involved in psychological operations
