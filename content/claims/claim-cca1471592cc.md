### Analysis

This claim is based on information from an unnamed confidential source ('my source is saying') about what Tyler Robinson was wearing when arrested. This is hearsay from an anonymous source and cannot be independently verified. The speaker is relaying second-hand information from a source they cannot publicly identify. Without access to arrest records, booking photos, or official police documentation, and without knowing the identity or credibility of the source, this claim remains unverifiable.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Release of arrest photos or footage to verify clothing
