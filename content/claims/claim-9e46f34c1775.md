## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This claim is based on a single source (the person Owens contacted who filmed footage). While there were documented communication failures between Secret Service and local police at the Butler rally, this specific claim about a witness who filmed the shooter on the roof not being contacted by FBI or local police cannot be independently verified through public reporting. The claim remains unverifiable without access to FBI investigative records or confirmation from the witness.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Contact filmer or official investigation records for confirmation
