### Analysis

Video analysis by multiple sources including Ian Carroll confirms that Mikey McCoy put his phone to his ear approximately 834 milliseconds (less than one second) after the gunshot. Frame-by-frame analysis shows McCoy's hand going up with phone in hand immediately after the shot, with no visible dialing motion. This specific timing measurement appears in Candace Owens' video analysis and has been discussed in multiple investigative reports. While the timing itself is verifiable from video evidence, the interpretation of what this timing means (suspicious vs. trauma response vs. following pre-established instructions) remains debated. The factual claim about the 834 millisecond timing is supported by video evidence.

**Confidence:** Medium
