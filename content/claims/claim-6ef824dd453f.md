### Analysis

This claim about Kash Patel installing Robert Bowles at the 'State Bureau' whose 'first case is Charlie Kirk's assassination' cannot be verified. While Charlie Kirk's assassination did occur on September 10, 2025, the specific claims about: (1) Kash Patel 'cleaning house' at an entity called the 'State Bureau,' (2) installing someone named Robert Bowles with 'long tenure in DC,' and (3) this being Bowles' first case - are not corroborated by available sources about the Kirk assassination investigation. The investigation appears to have been handled by local Utah authorities and the FBI. The suspect Tyler Robinson surrendered the next day after his parents recognized him from released photos. No public sources mention Kash Patel's involvement or a person named Robert Bowles leading the investigation. Sources: Wikipedia, NBC News, PBS, Britannica (Assassination of Charlie Kirk)

**Confidence:** Low
