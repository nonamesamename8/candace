### Analysis

This claim attributes a specific quote to FBI communications with Utah authorities. No credible news sources or official statements confirm the FBI made this specific statement. While FBI Director Kash Patel did face criticism for his handling of the investigation and had heated exchanges with Salt Lake City SAC Robert Bohls, there is no documented evidence of the FBI telling Utah authorities to close the case to avoid jeopardizing the Tyler Robinson prosecution. This appears to be speculation or an unverified insider claim.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Court records or statements in Tyler Robinson prosecution
