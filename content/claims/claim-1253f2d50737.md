### Analysis

Operation Mockingbird was a real CIA program from the Cold War era that involved media manipulation, confirmed by Church Committee investigations in 1975-76. However, the claim that mainstream media 'has been controlled' (present tense) since then is disputed. The CIA claimed the operation ended in 1976, though debates continue. The extent of control and whether systematic manipulation continues is contested by historians.
