### Analysis

Multiple reliable news sources, including ABC News, NBC News, and The Guardian, confirm that Australian Immigration Minister Tony Burke denied Candace Owens a visa in October 2024, effectively banning her from entering the country for a speaking tour. The decision was based on character grounds and concerns she could incite discord. Australia's High Court upheld the ban in October 2025. The claim refers to Owens being banned, with 'us' likely meaning her and her associated tour or show, which aligns with the evidence.
