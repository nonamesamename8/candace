### Analysis

Confirmed through multiple sources. Brian Harpole, head of Charlie Kirk's security team, publicly shared text messages between Dan Flood (Turning Point USA security) and UVU Police Chief Jeff Long in interviews with Shawn Ryan and in news coverage. Multiple news outlets (Gateway Pundit, Salt Lake Tribune, Breitbart, Slay News) reported that Harpole presented these text messages showing the rooftop security communication. The texts showed warnings about student roof access at the Sorensen Center and Chief Long's response 'I got you covered.' The text exchange occurred on September 8, two days before the incident.

**Confidence:** High
