### Analysis

TRUE. The first official video footage of the Pentagon on 9/11 was not released until May 16, 2006 - nearly 5 years after the attacks. Judicial Watch filed a FOIA request in December 2004, and the DoD acknowledged possessing video in January 2005 but refused to release it, citing the ongoing Zacarias Moussaoui trial. Judicial Watch sued in February 2006, and the footage was finally released in May 2006 after the trial concluded. Sources: CNN (5/16/2006), Judicial Watch records, Fox News.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Check historical records on 9/11 footage release
