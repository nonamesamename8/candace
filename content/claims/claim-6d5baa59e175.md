### Analysis

This claim is mixed. While Charlie Kirk did state this in May 2025, the accuracy of the underlying assertion is questionable. The March 2025 declassified JFK files did trigger widespread social media speculation about Mossad involvement, but fact-checkers found no direct documentary evidence in the released files proving Mossad was involved. Kirk's claim that 'Mossad is mentioned' in the files appears to conflate social media discussion and conspiracy theories with actual documentary evidence. The files themselves don't provide a 'smoking gun' document proving Mossad orchestration, though the topic has been discussed by historians like Martin Sandler.
