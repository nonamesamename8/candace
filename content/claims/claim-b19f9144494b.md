### Analysis

Official U.S. State Department guidelines confirm that foreign state aircraft, including military jets, require diplomatic clearance to enter and operate in U.S. airspace, ensuring federal government awareness and approval. Multiple sources, including FAA and DoD documents, support that such landings are monitored and cannot occur without attention. However, the claim's assertion of a required 'federal escort' (implying physical or airborne accompaniment) is not explicitly mandated in these policies; escorts may be provided in specific security contexts (e.g., interceptions per FAA guidelines) but are not a standard requirement for cleared flights.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** State Department protocols for foreign military aircraft landings
