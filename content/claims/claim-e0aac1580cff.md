### Analysis

Mixed/Disputed: There are conflicting reports about whether Charlie Kirk was on the Ukrainian Myrotvorets list. Some social media posts claim he was added in 2024 and later removed, while NewsGuard and fact-checkers state this claim was fabricated on Russian Telegram and there is no evidence he was ever on the list. Other Americans like Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, and Elon Musk have been confirmed on the list. Cannot definitively verify if Kirk was specifically on the list. Sources: ConflictDISP X post, AIC, Kyiv Post, The American Conservative, Yahoo News.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Public hit list verification
