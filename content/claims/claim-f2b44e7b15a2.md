### Analysis

The claim states Robinson's father believed the rifle matched one given to his son as a gift. Public sources confirm the rifle WAS a gift, but from Robinson's GRANDFATHER, not just generically 'given to his son as a gift.' Multiple sources (ABC News, CBS News, PBS) confirm prosecutors stated the rifle 'had been a gift from Robinson's grandfather.' The claim is partially accurate but lacks the specific detail that it was from the grandfather. The father did recognize his son from surveillance images and contacted him.
