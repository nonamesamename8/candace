### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including news articles from Times Now, Fox News, and Hindustan Times, as well as podcasts from CrossExamined and I Don't Have Enough FAITH to Be an ATHEIST, report on Pastor Rob McCoy discussing the future of Turning Point USA shortly after Charlie Kirk's assassination. These sources describe McCoy revealing plans to continue Kirk's legacy, with involvement from Mikey McCoy as Chief of Staff, aligning with the claim of a clear succession plan being implemented.
