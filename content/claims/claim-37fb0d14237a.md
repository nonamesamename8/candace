### Analysis

This claim alleges that the person who posted/shared the viral photo of George Zinn in handcuffs was someone from Utah who advertises with Turning Point USA. While George Zinn was indeed arrested and photos/videos of him in handcuffs went viral on social media after the Charlie Kirk shooting, extensive searches found no publicly available information identifying who originally took or first posted this specific photo, nor any connection to a Utah-based Turning Point USA advertiser. News sources report the images 'spread rapidly on social media' and 'circulated online' without attribution to an original source. Without access to the speaker's research or the specific individual being referenced, this claim cannot be independently verified.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Public advertising records or statements from TPUSA
