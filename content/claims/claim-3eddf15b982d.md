### Analysis

According to National File reporting in November 2025, Candace Owens reported that TPUSA reached out to Matt Walsh to host Charlie Kirk's show after his death, and the request was met with a condition from The Daily Wire that Ben Shapiro also be invited. However, the specific detail about whether this was a condition for hosting versus a condition that emerged during planning is important. Multiple sources confirm that Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, and Michael Knowles did jointly host The Charlie Kirk Show on September 16, 2025. The claim is partially verifiable but the exact nature of the 'condition' and who imposed it remains disputed - Owens claims it came from Daily Wire, while others suggest TPUSA voluntarily invited all three hosts. Sources: National File, Barrett Media, Daily Wire coverage September 2025.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** TPUSA and Daily Wire communications post-Charlie Kirk's death
