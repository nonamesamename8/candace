### Analysis

Candace Owens claims to have an 80-page document about Thomas Matthew Crooks' online accounts and statements. While Crooks did attempt to assassinate Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, there is no way to verify whether Owens actually possesses such a document. The FBI conducted an extensive investigation of Crooks, but Owens' claim about having scraped his data before the feds removed it cannot be independently confirmed.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Public release of document
