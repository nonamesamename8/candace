### Analysis

This is Candace's editorial/sarcastic commentary. Law enforcement DID promise swift action, and Tyler Robinson WAS arrested after a 33-hour manhunt (objectively swift by any standard). However, Candace is expressing skepticism that the investigation was 'successful' - this is her subjective opinion. The claim is MIXED because the factual part (LE promised swift action) is true, the arrest was objectively swift, but her 'spoiler alert: no' is editorial opinion questioning whether they got it right.
