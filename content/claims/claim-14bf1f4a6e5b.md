### Analysis

Unverifiable. This is Candace Owens' personal account of a private phone call. While multiple sources confirm the broader controversy involving Owens, Trump, and the Macrons regarding Brigitte Macron, the specific detail that 'Sergio Gor called on February 25th' cannot be independently verified as it describes a private communication. The broader context (Trump calling Owens about Brigitte Macron in February 2025) is corroborated by multiple news sources, but the specific date and details of Sergio Gor's call remain Owens' personal testimony.

**Confidence:** Low
