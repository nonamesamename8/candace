## Claim

> they basically gutted and replaced about half of their leadership in mid-August. Check out this article published on August 20th. In 2025, a change of command took place across six regiments. Now, we researched, and look, I'm not a military buff, but we found that they have 12 regiments that are known of. And you're telling me that they gutted leadership of six, they put in six new commanders
