## Claim

> they basically gutted and replaced about half of their leadership in mid-August. Check out this article published on August 20th. In 2025, a change of command took place across six regiments. Now, we researched, and look, I'm not a military buff, but we found that they have 12 regiments that are known of.

Confirmed by Foreign Legion Information. Article published August 20, 2025 documents 'Foreign Legion: 2025 Change of Command took place in six regiments' during summer 2025. The six regiments were: 1st Foreign Regiment (1er RE), 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment (1er REC), 1st Foreign Engineer Regiment (1er REG), 2nd Foreign Engineer Regiment (2e REG), 4th Foreign Regiment (4e RE), and 5th Foreign Regiment (5e RE). The French Foreign Legion has approximately 12 regiments total, so this represents approximately half of their known regiments. The changes were part of standard two-year command rotation cycle.
