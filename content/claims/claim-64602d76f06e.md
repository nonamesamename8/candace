### Analysis

Web searches confirm Rob McCoy has connections to Coronado (he was born and raised there) and multiple sources mention he owns a home in Coronado near San Diego. However, no public real estate records or listings were found confirming a specific sale listing on August 24, 2025. Real estate listing data may not be fully indexed or publicly accessible. The claim is specific and verifiable in principle but cannot be confirmed without access to MLS data or property records.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Real estate listing records
