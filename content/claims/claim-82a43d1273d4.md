### Analysis

Candace Owens was separated from Daily Wire on March 22, 2024. YWLS 2024 (Young Women's Leadership Summit) took place June 7-9, 2024 in San Antonio, Texas, and Candace Owens was listed as one of the speakers. This places the YWLS event approximately 2.5 months after her departure from Daily Wire, making the claim 'right after I was fired' somewhat accurate in political timeline terms.

**Confidence:** High
