### Analysis

Multiple credible sources confirm Lance Twiggs was kicked out by his parents during high school. Fox News reports a family member stated his father thought he was 'disrespectful and problematic' and kicked him out during junior year. Additional sources confirm he was kicked out before age 18, though there are conflicting accounts about the reasons (family says drug use/gaming addiction; friends say rejection of Mormonism). The core claim that he was kicked out during junior year of high school is corroborated by multiple independent sources.

**Confidence:** Medium
