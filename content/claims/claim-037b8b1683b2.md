### Analysis

I found extensive documentation of Governor Cox's press conferences on September 11 and 12, 2025 regarding the Charlie Kirk shooting. The timeline shows George Zinn was detained (not the actual shooter), and a second person of interest (Zachariah Qureshi) was briefly detained and released. However, I could not find specific documentation of a '5:30 p.m. press conference' or Cox mentioning a 'second suspect wearing all dark clothing' at the 12-minute mark. The documented press conferences were on Sept 11 (various times) and Sept 12 (when Tyler Robinson was announced as the actual suspect). The specific timing and description claimed cannot be verified from available sources.
