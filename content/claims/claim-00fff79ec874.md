### Analysis

News reports and posts found on X about Erika Kirk's interview with Jesse Watters indicate she discussed seeing evidence related to her husband's death, including the autopsy report. The podcast transcript directly quotes her statement, and secondary sources align with this without contradiction, though a primary transcript of the full interview would provide higher confidence.

**Confidence:** Medium
