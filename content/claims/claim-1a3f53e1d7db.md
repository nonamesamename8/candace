### Analysis

Jon Lewis, who served as President of The Daily Wire, was a Section Leader in the United States Marine Corps, not a naval intelligence officer. Multiple professional profiles (linkedin.com/in/jon-lewis-30468047) confirm his Marine Corps background and his BA in Religion from Hillsdale College (2009-2013). While he did study religion and later worked in leadership at a conservative media organization, the claim that he was a 'naval intelligence officer' is incorrect - he served in the Marine Corps.

**Confidence:** High
