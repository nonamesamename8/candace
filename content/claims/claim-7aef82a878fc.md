### Analysis

This claim comes from Tucker Carlson's statements about Kirk's views. Web search confirms Carlson did claim Kirk felt Netanyahu was 'a very destructive force' and was 'appalled by what was happening in Gaza.' However, this characterization is disputed. Senator Ted Cruz contradicted this, noting Kirk was 'deeply concerned about rising antisemitism on the right.' Kirk's own writings show he was pro-Israel but warned Netanyahu about losing American support and questioned Israel's security failures. The claim reflects one person's characterization of Kirk's views, which is disputed by others who knew him. Kirk's actual views appear more nuanced than this simple statement suggests.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Private communications released
