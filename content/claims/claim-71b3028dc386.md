## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This is a subjective opinion claim, not a factual assertion. Netanyahu made public statements denying Israel's involvement in Charlie Kirk's death and calling conspiracy theories about Israeli involvement 'a monstrous big lie.' Whether these statements were lies is a matter of opinion and belief, not verifiable fact. The truth or falsity of Netanyahu's denial cannot be independently verified without direct evidence about the assassination.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Comparison of statements by Netanyahu and known facts about Charlie Kirk
