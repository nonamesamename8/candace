### Analysis

Confirmed through multiple sources. Court documents and news reports verify that the Macrons sent their first retraction demand/cease-and-desist to Owens in December 2024. CBS News, Fortune, and the Delaware Superior Court complaint all reference this December 2024 cease-and-desist. The exact date of December 3rd is a specific personal detail that cannot be independently verified from public sources, but the December 2024 timeframe is well-documented.
