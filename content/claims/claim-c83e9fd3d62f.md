### Analysis

This is expert analysis from Rob O'Neill, a verified former Navy SEAL with 16+ years of service, 400+ combat missions, and extensive combat experience including being credited with shooting Osama bin Laden. His credentials as a special warfare operator with direct experience in combat shooting are verifiable and true. However, his specific forensic conclusions about wound types based on video observation ('That was not an entry wound... We saw an exit wound') are expert opinions, not independently verifiable facts without access to actual forensic reports. The expertise is real; the specific conclusions are professional opinion.

**Confidence:** Medium
