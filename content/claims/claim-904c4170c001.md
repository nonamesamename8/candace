### Analysis

GMA did interview Tiffany Barker and her nieces who were eyewitnesses to the shooting, as confirmed by Good Morning America coverage and ABC News video archives. However, I could not find confirmation that the specific names 'Elle Steele' and 'Mia Grant' are accurate, nor could I verify the 'family of 16' detail or that they would provide testimony about the shooting specifically. The core claim that children witnessed the shooting and were interviewed with their aunt Tiffany on GMA is true, but specific identifying details remain unverified.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Review indictment and eyewitness accounts
