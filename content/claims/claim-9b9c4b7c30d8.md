### Analysis

This claim about a pipeline's location relative to Charlie Kirk's position at the shooting cannot be independently verified. The speaker references 'old pictures' showing a pipeline 'almost exactly behind where Charlie was sitting' but doesn't provide these images or cite specific sources. Campus infrastructure details like pipeline locations are typically not part of public reporting about the shooting. Without access to UVU campus infrastructure maps or the specific photos referenced, this claim cannot be verified.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Site maps or old photos of UVU event area
