### Analysis

No public sources confirm FBI pressure on Utah authorities to close the Charlie Kirk case or rule it a lone gunman killing. Official sources confirm Tyler Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The FBI investigated and Robinson turned himself in. While FBI Director Kash Patel faced criticism for his handling of the case (including a premature social media post), there is no publicly available evidence of FBI pressure to close the case prematurely or declare it a lone gunman scenario. This claim appears to be based on unnamed 'authoritative sources' not verifiable through public records. Sources: FBI.gov press releases, Wikipedia, NBC News, CNN, CBS News coverage of the assassination.
