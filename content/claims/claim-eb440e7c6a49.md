### Analysis

Owens claims she contacted a witness who filmed video of the Charlie Kirk shooter and that the witness said neither federal nor local police had contacted him. However, this is an unverified secondhand account. Multiple sources confirm that FBI and local authorities conducted extensive witness interviews after the assassination. News reports indicate 'thousands of students' were present and prosecutors noted the process to identify witnesses could be laborious. Without identifying the specific witness or independent confirmation, this claim cannot be verified.
