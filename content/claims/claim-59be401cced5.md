### Analysis

Verified that Incyte, a global biopharmaceutical company, owns the Bracebridge buildings at 1100 North King Street on Rodney Square in Wilmington, Delaware. Multiple sources confirm that in May 2024, Incyte announced the renovation was 'expected to take about a year, depending on construction issues.' This matches the claim exactly. Incyte purchased the former MBNA buildings and planned to renovate Bracebridge I first, with an estimated one-year timeline announced in May 2024.

**Confidence:** High
