## Claim

> Seth Dillon was the one that was applying pressure to him, and Seth Dillon and Josh Hammer—Josh Hammer didn't jump on him in that moment—were not happy. They were not happy with Charlie at the end of this weekend in the Hamptons because, again, they saw which way the wind was traveling in terms of his positions on Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel.

### Analysis

Verified MIXED. The Hamptons meeting in August 2024 is confirmed by multiple sources. Seth Dillon confirmed attending and acknowledged Charlie Kirk raised concerns about free speech regarding Israel criticism. However, the specific characterizations of Dillon and Hammer being 'not happy' are contested. Dillon stated: 'If there were private meetings that took place, I wasn't in them. If there were angry confrontations, threats, or coercion, I didn't witness or hear about any of it.' This is Owens' interpretation of events, and while the meeting and discussions about Israel occurred, the emotional states and specific dynamics she describes are disputed by participants.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Gather accounts from attendees of the Hamptons weekend
