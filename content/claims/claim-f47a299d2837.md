## Claim

> Seth Dillon was the one that was applying pressure to him, and Seth Dillon and Josh Hammer—Josh Hammer didn't jump on him in that moment—were not happy. They were not happy with Charlie at the end of this weekend in the Hamptons because, again, they saw which way the wind was traveling in terms of his positions on Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel.
