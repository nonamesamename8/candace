### Analysis

This claim makes highly specific assertions about Egyptian aircraft SU-BND: that it flew into St. Louis, Missouri on February 21st, 2023, landed at 2:38 p.m., and remained there until May 2023. While SU-BND is confirmed to exist as an Egyptian-registered Gulfstream 4SP in aviation databases (FlightAware and Flightradar24), verifying the specific flight details from February 2023 requires access to historical flight tracking data that is not freely available in web searches. Flight tracking services like FlightAware maintain historical records, but accessing data from nearly 2 years ago (February 2023) typically requires premium access or specialized data requests. Additionally, government or military aircraft may have limited or restricted tracking data. Without access to comprehensive historical flight records for this specific tail number, date, time, and multi-month stay duration, these precise claims cannot be independently verified through public sources.

**Confidence:** Medium
