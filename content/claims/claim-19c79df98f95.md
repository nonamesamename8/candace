### Analysis

This claim makes a subjective characterization about 'Zionists' putting pressure on Charlie Kirk and attempting to control him. This is unverifiable because: 1) It relies on the speaker's interpretation of events and motivations, 2) The term 'Zionists' is vague and not clearly defined, 3) Claims about 'circling' and 'trying to control' are subjective assessments rather than objective facts, 4) Without documented evidence of specific individuals or groups and their actions, this characterization cannot be independently verified. The speaker does reference a conversation with Charlie Kirk about pressure, but the framing as 'Zionists circling' is interpretive.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Potentially verifiable through communications or witness accounts
