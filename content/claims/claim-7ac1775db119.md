### Analysis

The claim that Courtney Love was experimented on at the Haight-Ashbury Clinic as a toddler is MIXED. What is documented: (1) Courtney Love was born in 1964 and spent early childhood in Haight-Ashbury during the hippie era; (2) During her parents' 1970 divorce, her mother Linda Carroll testified that her father Hank Harrison gave her LSD as a toddler (Harrison denied this); (3) Louis Jolyon West, an LSD researcher involved in MKUltra, lived near the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic and was allowed to recruit clients for experiments. However, there is no independent verification that Love was specifically experimented on AT the clinic as part of CIA programs. The LSD allegations stem from divorce proceedings, not documented CIA experiments. Candace Owens claims Love told her this directly in 2025, but this hasn't been independently verified.
