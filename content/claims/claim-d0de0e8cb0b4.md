### Analysis

Verified as MIXED. The claim contains one factual error. Ben Shapiro did tweet about 'a pure form of anti-Semitism' related to Israel-first accusations, but the exact wording was different and the target was not accurately stated. The actual tweet (Dec 24, 2016) reads: 'Accusing any American Jew who is pro-Israel of being an Israel Firster is a pure form of anti-Semitism.' The claim states he accused 'any American Jew who is pro-Israel first' - the actual tweet says 'being an Israel Firster' (a different concept). Additionally, while the tweet was made in response to Nick Fuentes, it was not directly 'directed at' Fuentes but was a quote-tweet responding to his earlier statement about dual loyalty. The core elements are accurate but with meaningful differences in wording and context. Source: Ben Shapiro X/Twitter December 24, 2016.

**Confidence:** High
