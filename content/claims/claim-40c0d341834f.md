### Analysis

MIXED: Kindergarten was founded by Friedrich Froebel in Germany in 1837, not communists. However, after the failed 1848 revolution, the Prussian government did denounce Froebel and his supporters as 'socialists and revolutionaries' and banned kindergartens in 1851. Margarethe Schurz and her husband (both liberal reformers who fled Germany after 1848) did establish the first US kindergarten in 1856. The claim conflates liberal/socialist reform movements with communist ideology and oversimplifies the political motivations.

**Confidence:** Medium

**Sources:**

- [Friedrich Fröbel - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Fr%C3%B6bel)
  - Documents that Froebel founded kindergarten in 1837 and was denounced as socialist/revolutionary by Prussian authorities

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify through historical records on Margarethe Schurz and origins of kindergarten
