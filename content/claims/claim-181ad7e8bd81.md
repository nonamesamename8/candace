### Analysis

The claim contains an error: it says 'Charlie Kirk's assassination' when context shows the speaker meant to say 'the morning after Charlie Kirk's assassination.' The substantive claim is that TMZ publicized footage the morning after the Sept 10, 2025 shooting. TMZ did extensively cover the event and published various footage including surveillance video of the suspect. However, the specific timing claim about footage being published 'the morning after' (Sept 11) versus the day of the shooting cannot be precisely verified. TMZ's main shooting timeline article was published Sept 16, though they posted various footage earlier.

**Confidence:** Medium
