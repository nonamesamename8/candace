### Analysis

While news coverage confirms that Orem Police were involved in the investigation and manhunt, and witnesses were interviewed by various news outlets, no publicly available sources identify a specific witness by this name or confirm their employment at the Orem Police Department. Employment records for police department staff are not always public, and witness identities in ongoing investigations may be protected. Without official confirmation from the department or news reports naming this individual, the employment claim cannot be independently verified.
