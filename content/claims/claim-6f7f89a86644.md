### Analysis

The dates are incorrect. According to multiple sources including Fortune and Sportskeeda, Owens first discussed Brigitte Macron on The Daily Wire on March 11, 2024 (not March 13), in an episode titled 'INSANE. This Is The BIGGEST Political Scandal In Human History.' She was notified of her termination on March 18, 2024 (according to her own account), and the public announcement was March 22, 2024 (not March 19). This is 11 days after the first episode, not 6 days as claimed.

**Confidence:** High
