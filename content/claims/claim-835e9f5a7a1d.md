### Analysis

Andrew Kolvet did make statements about Charlie Kirk's neck stopping a .30-06 bullet, calling it a 'miracle.' However, Kolvet attributed this to the surgeon's claim about Charlie's bone density being 'impressive' and him being 'like the man of steel,' not specifically to 'eating salad.' Kolvet stated the surgeon said 'the bone was so healthy and the density was so impressive.' The salad eating detail is not verified in the statement.
