### Analysis

The claim references theories about how Robinson concealed and transported the Mauser rifle. According to NBC News and other sources, the rifle was recovered intact, wrapped in a towel in bushes - not disassembled. Surveillance footage showed Robinson 'walking with an unusual gait' with 'very little bending in his right leg, consistent with a rifle being hidden in his pants.' However, evidence suggests the rifle was NOT disassembled into parts as the claim suggests. While videos online debate whether the rifle could be quickly disassembled, the FBI found the rifle intact. The '2 seconds' claim appears to be skeptical commentary, not an official explanation. The claim misrepresents what investigators actually concluded.
