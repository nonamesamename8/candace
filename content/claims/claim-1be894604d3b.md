## Verification

**Confidence:** Low

### Analysis

No reliable sources, including major news outlets like CNN, were found confirming the existence of the claimed article or the student's account of seeing a man on the Lozier/Losee Center roof a week before the September 10, 2025, shooting. Available web results and X posts describe sightings on the day of the event but not prior weeks. The Wikipedia entry and FBI updates detail the assassination but omit any pre-event roof sightings. To verify, access to CNN archives from September 11, 2025, or direct statements from the alleged student/FBI tip line records via FOIA would be needed. Multiple search strategies yielded no supporting evidence, suggesting the claim may be unsubstantiated interpretation.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** CNN article from day after assassination or contact student/FBI tip line
