### Analysis

Cannot independently verify this personal account. While Trump and Macron did meet on February 24, 2025 (confirmed by multiple sources including C-SPAN, NPR, CBS News), and the meeting did discuss Ukraine peace negotiations, there is no public documentation of Charlie Kirk calling Owens on behalf of the White House that day. This is a personal communication claim that only the parties involved can verify. News reports from later in 2025 mention Owens claiming Trump called her about Brigitte Macron in June, but do not confirm the February 24 Charlie Kirk call.

**Confidence:** Medium
