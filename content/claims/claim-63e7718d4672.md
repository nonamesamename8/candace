### Analysis

This claim asserts that Charlie Kirk was attending Catholic mass before his death. This is a personal religious practice claim that cannot be independently verified through public sources. While Candace Owens states this as fact based on her personal knowledge, there are no public records, photographs, witness testimonies, or other independent verification of Kirk's private religious practices. The claim is inherently unverifiable without access to personal witnesses or Kirk's private life documentation.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Confirmation from associates or family
