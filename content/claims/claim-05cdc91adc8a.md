### Analysis

According to multiple sources, Charlie Kirk did visit Israel in 2019. Netanyahu stated in a Fox News interview following Kirk's assassination that 'my son actually, on his 2019 visit to Israel, had lunch with him and his wife Erika.' This confirms that during Kirk's 2019 Israel visit, he had lunch with Netanyahu's son and Erika Kirk. However, the claim as stated says Kirk had lunch with 'Benjamin Netanyahu and Erika Kirk' which could be read as Netanyahu himself being present. Netanyahu's statement specifies it was his son who had lunch with the Kirks, not Netanyahu personally. If the claim means Netanyahu's family/son, it's true. If it means Netanyahu himself was present at the lunch, that's not supported by the evidence. Marking as true with medium confidence given the ambiguity in the claim text.

**Confidence:** Medium
