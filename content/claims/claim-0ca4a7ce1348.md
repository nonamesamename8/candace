### Analysis

Cannot independently verify this personal account. There is no public documentation of President Trump calling Owens on February 26, 2025. News sources from later in 2025 mention Owens claiming Trump called her in June about stopping discussion of Brigitte Macron in relation to Ukraine peace negotiations, but there is no corroboration of a February 26 call. This is a private communication that only the parties involved can verify. Given the sensitive nature and lack of any corroborating evidence, confidence is low.

**Confidence:** Low
