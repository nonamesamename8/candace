### Analysis

Partially verified: Multiple sources confirm Charlie Kirk attended a 'Save the West' retreat in the Hamptons in August 2025, and that he expressed concerns about being unable to criticize Israel without backlash. Seth Dillon and others present confirmed Kirk raised these concerns, though they dispute characterizations of 'pressure' or 'intervention.' Kirk allegedly stated if he tweeted criticism of Netanyahu he would be unfairly attacked, and this reportedly led to debate with Seth Dillon.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify with retreat attendees
