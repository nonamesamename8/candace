### Analysis

Multiple news sources and social media discussions, including articles from The Times of India and The Guardian, report on Candace Owens' podcast claims about discrepancies in the narrative surrounding Charlie Kirk's shooting, such as Mikey McCoy's position and lack of blood evidence. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) describe video footage showing McCoy behind the tent, walking away immediately after the shot without approaching Kirk, supporting the claim that he had no blood on him. No reliable sources refute this, though it mixes verifiable video analysis with interpretive conspiracy elements; confidence is medium due to reliance on secondary reports of video without direct primary access.

**Confidence:** Medium
