### Analysis

False: Court documents and prosecutors explicitly state Tyler Robinson sent text messages to his roommate/partner on the day of the shooting, confessing to the killing. The texts included 'I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it' and 'I had enough of his hatred.' These messages became key evidence in charging Robinson. While conspiracy theories emerged questioning their authenticity, no credible evidence supports they were fabricated. The claim that Tyler 'absolutely did not author those text messages' is contradicted by official legal proceedings.

**Confidence:** High
