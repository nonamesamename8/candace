### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, The Guardian, ABC News, BBC, and FBI releases, detail the shooting event, footage availability, security aspects, and timeline, but none directly address whether immediate first aid was administered by the security team, such as applying gauze or pressure to the wound. The widow's thanks to first responders in BBC reporting implies some response occurred, but this likely refers to emergency services rather than immediate security actions. To verify, access to the full multi-angle footage (as referenced in sources like The Guardian and ABC News visual timeline) or official incident reports from UVU security, first responders, or autopsy details would be required; these could be obtained via FOIA requests to the FBI or local authorities.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Review security footage from UVU event for first aid administration
