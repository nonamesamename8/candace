### Analysis

The Brigitte Macron lawsuit is confirmed to exist - it was filed in Delaware Superior Court in July 2025 by the law firm Clare Locke. Multiple news sources confirm this is 'an immensely costly legal battle' with Clare Locke having previously won 87.5M from Fox News. However, the specific figure of 'over a quarter of a million dollars' in legal costs cannot be independently verified as Owens' legal expenses are private financial information. The lawsuit has not yet had its first day in court as of the claim date, which is accurate.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Track lawsuit progress and financial disclosures
