### Analysis

This claim is about a specific individual's employment history. While JPMorgan Chase has extensive software engineering positions and the timeline is plausible, no public records confirm this specific person's move to Utah or employment at JPMorgan Chase in May 2024. LinkedIn profiles and employment records for private individuals are not publicly verifiable through web search, and the person's identity (Gernot from Austria) appears to be based on podcast investigation rather than official sources. Without access to employment verification or the individual's own public statements, this remains unverifiable.

**Confidence:** High
