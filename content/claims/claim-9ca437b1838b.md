The claim naming 'Shawna Rae Kirkhoff' originated from a Nov 8, 2025 Blaze News report that was retracted on Dec 4, 2025. The Blaze stated 'we consider the values of fairness and accuracy to require retraction.' The person named is categorically incorrect - wrong gender, wrong identity, and based on a retracted story with discredited gait analysis.

**Confidence:** High
