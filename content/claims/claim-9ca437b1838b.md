### Analysis

Multiple reliable news outlets, including NBC, NPR, ABC, CBS, POLITICO, and Axios, report that on December 4, 2025, the FBI arrested Brian J. Cole, a Virginia man, in connection with the January 5, 2021, pipe bombs near DNC and RNC headquarters. The claim appears to stem from a November 2025 Blaze Media report alleging a forensic match to former Capitol Police officer Shauni Rae Kerkhoff (similar to the named 'Shawna Rae Kirkhoff'), but Blaze Media retracted this report on December 4, 2025, after the official arrest. Snopes also confirms the retraction and the charging of Cole, contradicting the claim.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Blaze News reporting or law enforcement confirmation on pipe bomber identity
