### Analysis

Partially verifiable. There is evidence Kirk discussed having ADHD as a child in public statements (referenced in podcast 'Charlie Kirk had ADHD' about a TPUSA Facebook video from ~4 years before 2025). However, the specific details about being 'extremely gifted,' attending a 'school for the gifted,' and his parents refusing medication are based on Candace Owens' personal recollections of stories Charlie told her, not independently verifiable public records. The ADHD diagnosis appears true; the gifted school details are unverifiable personal anecdotes.

**Confidence:** Medium
