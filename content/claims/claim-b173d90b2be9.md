### Analysis

TPUSA spokesman Andrew Kolvet did issue a statement explaining Mikey McCoy's actions after the shooting. According to multiple news sources, Kolvet stated: 'Charlie had given me similar instructions, if anything ever happens to me you call Erika, and he drilled that into Mikey's brain so that when this moment of trauma happened, that he turned around and he knew he had to do it.' This confirms TPUSA made this claim about Charlie instructing Mikey beforehand. However, we cannot independently verify whether Charlie actually gave these instructions - we can only verify that TPUSA made this statement, which is what the claim asserts.

**Confidence:** Medium
