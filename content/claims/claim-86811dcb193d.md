### Analysis

The claim suggests the Trogneux chocolatier business could not have operated continuously from the 1880s through now due to Nazi occupation and bombardment of Amiens. However, historical records show Jean Trogneux chocolatier was established in 1872 and has been run by six generations of the family continuously to present day. While Amiens was indeed occupied by Nazis in WWII and suffered Allied bombardments, the business evidently survived these events, as it operates today under the same family ownership since 1872.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Historical records of WWII events in Amiens and Trogneux family business
