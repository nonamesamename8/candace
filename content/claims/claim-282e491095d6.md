### Analysis

The meeting between President al-Sisi and PM Sarra Zaafrani (also spelled Sarah Zafrani) did occur on September 10, but in 2025, not 2024. The claim also incorrectly identifies her position - Zaafrani was appointed PM in March 2025, so she would have been PM by Sept 10, 2025. The meeting was confirmed at Al-Ittihadiya Palace in Cairo. However, the transcript context suggests this may be referring to Sept 10, 2024, when Zaafrani was NOT yet PM. Sources: Daily News Egypt, Egypt Independent, Ahram Online, Egypt SIS
