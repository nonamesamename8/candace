### Analysis

This claim is about a private text message allegedly sent by Charlie Kirk in February 2024 saying 'Catholicism is sounding better and better.' While multiple sources confirm Kirk had been showing increasing interest in Catholicism, was attending Mass with his Catholic wife, reportedly prayed the rosary daily, and was said to be considering conversion, the specific text message content and exact date cannot be independently verified through public sources. Private communications between individuals can only be verified by the participants themselves or through released screenshots. The broader narrative about Kirk's Catholic leanings is well-documented but this specific message remains unverifiable.

**Confidence:** High
