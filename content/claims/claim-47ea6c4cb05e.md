> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This claim makes a specific assertion about the distance (3-4 hours) between a campus and a residence shared by Tyler and Lance. The context suggests this relates to an investigation involving Tyler Robinson and UVU (Utah Valley University). To verify this claim would require: (1) knowing the exact address of Tyler and Lance's shared residence, (2) confirming the campus location being referenced, and (3) calculating actual travel time. This specific residential address information is not publicly available, and even if the campus is UVU in Orem, Utah, the claim cannot be verified without the residential address. Such specific details about individuals involved in criminal investigations are protected information.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify distance between Orem, UT (UVU) and their residence location
