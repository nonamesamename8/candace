### Analysis

REVISED VERIFICATION: The claim is PARTIALLY TRUE. Business directories like Buzzfile list the DEA at 920 N King St, Wilmington (Paul Moloney, Branch Manager, 302-573-6184). Yelp lists Secret Service at same address. DOJ directory from 2000 confirms DEA Wilmington Resident Office was at Suite 404, One Rodney Square, 920 King Street. However, other sources show Secret Service at 500 Delaware Ave. The building is One Rodney Square, a commercial office building that historically housed federal agencies. Some public directories DO show these agencies at this address, though it's unclear if current or legacy listings. Original FALSE rating was too strong - directories DO list agencies there.

**Confidence:** Medium
