### Analysis

The claim recounts a private conversation where an unnamed individual describes their position next to Charlie Kirk during the shooting and their immediate assessment of his condition. While news sources like The Guardian provide visual timelines, maps, and videos of the incident, they do not identify specific individuals seated to Kirk's left or confirm actions like securing footage. Social media posts discuss footage and suspicions about people near Kirk, but these are not reliable primary sources. Verification would require the individual's identity, access to unedited event footage for position confirmation, and possibly call records or statements from Candace Owens or the individual to substantiate the conversation.

**Confidence:** Low
