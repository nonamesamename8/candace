### Analysis

This claim concerns a private decision by Charlie Kirk to decline funding offers. The context suggests this involved private communications between Kirk and Bill Ackman/others regarding potential funding for TPUSA trips to Israel. Unless the parties involved publicly confirm or deny these private conversations and offers, or internal documents are released, there is no way to independently verify what funding was offered or declined through publicly available sources.

**Confidence:** High
