### Analysis

This claim describes the speaker's own investigative efforts and inability to find records of Sherry Steele. BBC did interview someone named Sherry Steele about witnessing police activity at Tyler Robinson's townhouse, but whether this person can be found in databases or contacted through Lance's family is not independently verifiable. The speaker's investigation methods and results cannot be confirmed.
