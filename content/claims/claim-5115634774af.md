### Analysis

This is Candace's claim about information she obtained from sources ('I learned that...I actually have the license plate numbers'). Without access to her source materials or independent verification of Duncan Aviation's rental car records, this cannot be verified through public information. The claim involves specific operational details (rental cars for 'Egyptians,' four license plates) that would require access to private business records or law enforcement investigation files to confirm.

**Confidence:** Low
