> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This is a personal statement about what an individual (appears to be a family member or associate) has personally seen. The claim is not about whether autopsy reports or evidence exist, but rather about this specific person's access to and viewing of these materials. Without independent confirmation from law enforcement, the coroner's office, or the individual's legal team, we cannot verify whether this person actually had access to these materials. This is testimonial/personal rather than a factual claim that can be independently verified.

**Confidence:** High
