### Analysis

The claim states that the person 'turned 22 back in August.' According to multiple sources including Wikipedia and NBC News, Tyler Robinson was born April 16, 2003, which would make him 22 years old as of the shooting in September 2025. If he turned 22 in April 2003, then he would have been 22 'back in August' of 2025. However, the context suggests this may be referring to Lance Twiggs, Robinson's roommate. Court documents confirm Robinson was 22 at the time of the shooting. The claim is factually accurate for Robinson's age.
