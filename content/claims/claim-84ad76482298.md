### Analysis

This reflects Candace Owens' characterization of Charlie Kirk's stated vision for TPUSA. While difficult to verify Kirk's exact internal intentions, his public statements and TPUSA's founding mission support this. Kirk founded TPUSA in 2012 as a conservative youth organization, became youngest speaker at 2016 RNC, and announced the Mount Vernon Project in 2022 to remove non-grassroots conservatives from RNC. Republican consultant Chuck Coughlin told NBC News TPUSA evolved into 'full takeover of the Republican Party.' The claim represents Owens' interpretation of Kirk's known public goals.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verification through historical records or statements from Charlie Kirk about TPUSA's goals.
