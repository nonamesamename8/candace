### Analysis

This is a subjective opinion/belief statement rather than a verifiable factual claim. The speaker is expressing her personal belief that there are 'some good feds' and 'an underground movement' within federal agencies. This type of claim about internal movements or the character of unnamed individuals cannot be objectively verified or falsified through public sources. It represents the speaker's perspective based on her experiences and communications.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Look for evidence of whistleblowers or movements within federal agencies
