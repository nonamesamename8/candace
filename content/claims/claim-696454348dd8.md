### Analysis

The ADL was indeed founded by B'nai B'rith in 1913. However, calling B'nai B'rith a 'Freemason organization' is misleading. B'nai B'rith was founded in 1843 as an independent Jewish fraternal organization. While some founders were Freemasons and it adopted Masonic-style rituals (secret degrees, signs), it was always a separate Jewish organization, not a Masonic one. It's more accurate to say B'nai B'rith was modeled after or influenced by Freemasonry.
