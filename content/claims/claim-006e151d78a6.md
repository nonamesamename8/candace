## Claim

> Two years later, the decomposing body of a Las Vegas prostitute was found stuffed in the air conditioner of a seedy motel. She was killed by three hired hands... the money traced back to the DuPont family... It appeared that Lisa Dean, who is a DuPont, didn't approve of her drug-addicted son dating a drug-addicted Vegas sex worker. So she and her husband, Christopher Mosley, had her killed. Both John DuPont and Mosley died in prison.
