### Analysis

Reliable news sources like Yahoo Finance and Fortune report that Turning Point USA had $85 million in revenue from a network of 500,000 donors following Charlie Kirk's death in September 2025, indicating a significant surge in donations post-death. Additional sources from The Guardian and Newsweek confirm increased fundraising and donations after the event, with one mentioning a $1 million pledge. Posts on X also reference figures around $80-90 million in the weeks following his death, supporting the claim's approximation of $90 million in that timeframe. Prior revenue was lower (e.g., $39.2 million in 2020), suggesting the jump includes post-death contributions. The claim is supported as an approximate figure, though exact timing and breakdown are not fully detailed in primary sources.
