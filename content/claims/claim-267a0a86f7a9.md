### Analysis

Partially verifiable. The claim that Tyler Robinson is 'not a gun enthusiast' conflicts with evidence. Multiple sources report: (1) Robinson had photos on social media holding guns, (2) He told coworkers about a 450-yard long-range rifle shot before the shooting, (3) His family is described as 'outdoorsy and like to hunt', (4) He used a Mauser Model 98 hunting rifle known for accuracy.

**Confidence:** Medium
