### Analysis

FACTUAL ERROR: The USS Liberty incident occurred on June 8, 1967, NOT 1960 as claimed. The speaker misstated the year by 7 years. The attack did occur (Israel attacked USS Liberty during the Six-Day War, killing 34 and wounding ~170), but the date in the claim is incorrect. Israel apologized and called it a case of mistaken identity. The claim is marked FALSE due to the incorrect date.
