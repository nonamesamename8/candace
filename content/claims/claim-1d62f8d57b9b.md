## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This claim makes very specific technical assertions about aircraft transponder data (SUBND transponding at Duncan Aviation on a specific date but not departing). Without access to: (1) the specific date being referenced, (2) actual FAA/ADS-B flight tracking records, (3) Duncan Aviation facility logs, or (4) independent verification of the aircraft tail number and its movements, this cannot be verified through publicly available sources. Flight tracking data for private aircraft is often incomplete or restricted.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Check FlightRadar24 or aviation transponder data for SUBND on date of incident
