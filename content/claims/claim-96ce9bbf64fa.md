### Analysis

Candace Owens claims that airport personnel had been instructed to lie about the Egyptian plane. This is an unverifiable allegation based on unnamed sources. No airport personnel have come forward publicly, no official statements from Provo Municipal Airport address this claim, and no law enforcement investigation has confirmed federal instruction to lie to the public. This claim appears in Owens' commentary but lacks any documentary evidence, corroboration from identified witnesses, or official confirmation. Cannot be verified or falsified with available public information.

**Confidence:** Low
