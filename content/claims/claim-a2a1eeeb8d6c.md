### Analysis

This claim is false. Jason Chaffetz's parents were not in the FBI. His father John A. Chaffetz was a businessman, and his mother Margaret (Peggy) Wood ran a photography business. However, Chaffetz's GRANDFATHER, Maxwell (Max) Chaffetz (1909-1986), was an FBI Special Agent. The speaker confused the generation - it was his grandfather, not his parents, who worked in the FBI. Sources: Wikipedia article on Jason Chaffetz.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Public records or Jason Chavitz's disclosures
