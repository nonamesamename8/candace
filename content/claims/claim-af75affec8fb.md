> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This is Candace's claim about medical/forensic information ('I have fact-checked this information from multiple sources'). The specific location of a bullet fragment ('almost in line with your shoulder blade, right in the center, touching your spine') would be contained in autopsy/medical examiner reports that are not publicly available. Without access to the official medical examiner's report or coroner's findings, this cannot be independently verified through public sources.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Autopsy or surgical records
