### Analysis

Verified as true in the context spoken. This is a subjective assertion made on episode 240, shortly after Kirk's death, where the speaker states they are not getting the full truth about what happened. This is an opinion statement about the state of information at that time (shortly after the shooting), which was factually accurate - many details were still emerging and unclear in the immediate aftermath of the assassination.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Release of official reports on Charlie Kirk's death
