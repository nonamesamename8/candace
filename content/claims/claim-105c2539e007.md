### Analysis

The article reports Candace Owens' claim of an Egyptian Air Force plane (SU-BTT) flying out of Utah on Sept 10 after Charlie Kirk's assassination, implying a prior landing, but provides no independent confirmation of a Sept 4 landing or it being a 'full flight.' Other sources treat this as a conspiracy theory, with some noting debunking due to time zone confusion (e.g., UTC vs. local time). No primary evidence like flight logs or official records found; verification would require FAA flight data, Flightradar24 records for SU-BTT on Sept 4, 2025, or official US/Egyptian government statements.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Verify flight logs for SU-BTT landing in Utah on September 4th
