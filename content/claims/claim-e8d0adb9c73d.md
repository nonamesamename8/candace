### Analysis

While Lance Wallnau was heavily involved in Stop the Steal messaging in late 2020 (confirmed by multiple sources showing he promoted election fraud claims and mobilized supporters), I could not find direct evidence of this specific November 6, 2020 Facebook post with this exact quote. Wallnau's social media history from that period is not publicly archived in searchable format. The claim about specific content on a specific date cannot be verified without access to the original post or archived screenshots.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Lance Wallnau's Facebook post from November 6, 2020
