### Analysis

This claim describes Charlie Kirk's subjective feeling that 'money was disappearing' from TPUSA. While IBTimes and other outlets reported on TPUSA financial opacity and Candace Owens' accusations about opaque pay structures, there is no independent verification that Charlie Kirk personally expressed this specific concern. This is a secondhand claim about Kirk's internal state of mind, sourced from anonymous insiders, and cannot be independently verified through public records.

**Confidence:** Low
