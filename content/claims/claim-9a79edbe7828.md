## Claim

> I feel like I was set up by the federal government in terms of this lawsuit. Like this wasn't just Brigitte and Emmanuel sitting down making a mistake by filing this cross-national lawsuit, but rather federal agencies which may have been colluding and speaking to one another about how to put an end to my research into who Brigitte was, because all of these governments are implicated. And by all of them, I mean France, the United States, and Israel implicated
