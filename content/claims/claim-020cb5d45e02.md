### Analysis

This claim is false. While N1098L is a real aircraft (a 2023 Bombardier Global 6500 registered to Lasai Aviation II and contracted to the U.S. Army via Leidos for training), FlightAware records show no activity near Provo, Utah on September 10, 2025 (the date of Charlie Kirk's assassination). The aircraft's recent documented flights were elsewhere, such as September 25 from Topeka to Biggs. This appears to be a conspiracy theory similar to the debunked claims about aircraft N888KG.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Flight tracking data (ADS-B)
