### Analysis

Confirmed. Multiple sources verify that Orem Police Department has an active, professional drone unit and SWAT team. Officials at the Utah County Sheriff's Office and Orem Police Department confirmed they were not involved in security for the September 10, 2025 event because Utah Valley University's police department did not request assistance, despite having a mutual aid agreement (MOU) in place. This was confirmed by Kirk's security director Brian Harpole.
