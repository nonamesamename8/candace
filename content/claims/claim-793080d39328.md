### Analysis

This claim is a quote attributed to Andrew Kolvet (Turning Point USA spokesperson) who claims to have spoken with Charlie Kirk's surgeon. The claim includes specific medical details about the bullet and forensic findings. Without access to the actual medical records, autopsy report, or direct verification from the surgeon, these second-hand medical claims cannot be independently verified. The speaker (Candace Owens) later disputes some of these claims, suggesting skepticism about their accuracy.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Surgeon or coroner confirmation
