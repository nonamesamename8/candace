### Analysis

Netanyahu quoted the opening sentence of Kirk's May letter accurately, but omitted critical context. The full 7-page letter showed Kirk warning Israel about losing MAGA support and criticizing Israeli intelligence. Candace Owens accused Netanyahu of 'lying by severe omission' and the full letter revealed her criticism had merit.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Compare Netanyahu's statements on Fox News/Greta Van Susteren with actual letter contents
