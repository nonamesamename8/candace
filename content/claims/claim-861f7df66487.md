Confirmed FALSE. No credible sources mention anyone named 'Jacob Kasparian' in connection with the Charlie Kirk assassination. The identified suspect is Tyler James Robinson, a 22-year-old from Washington County, Utah. Robinson was arrested and charged with aggravated murder. Multiple mainstream sources (CNN, ABC News, NBC, Fox News, Wikipedia) all identify Tyler Robinson as the shooter. No connection to a Mormon temple president in Los Angeles exists in any reporting.
