### Analysis

Unverifiable. This is a personal claim by Candace Owens about private conversations she had with Charlie Kirk and Andrew Kolvet regarding hosting Nick Fuentes. Andrew Kolvet is confirmed to be a real spokesperson/executive at Turning Point USA who continues to work there after Kirk's death. While the existence of tensions between Kirk/TPUSA and Nick Fuentes is well-documented (the 2019 'Groyper Wars'), there is no independent verification of these specific private conversations. Only the parties involved could confirm or deny these discussions occurred.
