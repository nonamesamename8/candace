### Analysis

The TPUSA Faith Pastors Summit in Nashville occurred May 24-26, 2023 (kicked off late afternoon May 24), not March 24, 2023. Multiple sources confirm over 1,100 pastors attended in late May with speakers including Rob McCoy and Charlie Kirk. The Covenant School shooting did occur on March 27, 2023, but this was 3 days after March 24, not during a TPUSA event that day.

**Confidence:** High
