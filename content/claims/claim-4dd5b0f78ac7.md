### Analysis

This accurately describes Jeffrey Masson's thesis in 'The Assault on Truth' (1984). Masson argues Freud's patients reported childhood sexual abuse (often by parents/fathers) but Freud abandoned his 'seduction theory' and recharacterized reports as fantasies. Multiple sources confirm Masson documented that Freud's female patients reported being abused as children but Freud disbelieved them. Wording is provocative but factually represents Masson's historical argument. Sources: Wikipedia, University of Texas, Amazon.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Review historical analyses of Freud's work and seduction theory.
