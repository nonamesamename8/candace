### Analysis

Netanyahu confirmed he invited Kirk to Israel two weeks before his assassination (not 'a few weeks before') in a statement posted on X after Kirk's death. The claim states Kirk 'declined' but there's no clear evidence Kirk explicitly declined the invitation before his death - Netanyahu said 'Sadly, that visit will not take place' referring to Kirk's assassination. The timing and invitation are confirmed, but characterizing it as 'declined' is misleading since Kirk was killed before he could visit. Sources: Netanyahu X statement, Newsweek, Jerusalem Post coverage.

**Confidence:** Medium
