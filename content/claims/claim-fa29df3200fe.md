### Analysis

Web search confirms both parts of this claim. Sheriff Nate Brooksby stated in a press conference that Tyler Robinson was 'truly fearful about being shot by law enforcement' and wanted a 'peaceful, gentle' surrender. Robinson told his parents he didn't want 'a big SWAT team at his parent's house or his apartment.' Multiple credible news sources (PBS, Newsweek, ABC News, Fox News) confirm Robinson negotiated his surrender specifically because he feared being shot by police, and he turned himself in at the Washington County Sheriff's Office on September 11, 2025. Brooksby also confirmed Robinson was not suicidal.

**Confidence:** High
