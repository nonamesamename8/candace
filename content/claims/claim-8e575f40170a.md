### Analysis

This claim alleges that Lance Wallnau was 'privately directing large sums of money into Turning Point USA Faith.' While Rolling Stone and other sources confirm Wallnau collaborated with Charlie Kirk and TPUSA Faith publicly, and TPUSA Faith had a .4M budget in 2021, no public sources verify the specific claim about Wallnau 'privately directing large sums' into TPUSA Faith. The speaker cites 'sources within Turning Point's faith department' but this cannot be independently verified. Wallnau's public role and partnership is confirmed, but the private funding claim remains unverified.
