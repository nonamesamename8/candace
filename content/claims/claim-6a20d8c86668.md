### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets or official flight records, confirm a plane departing Provo, Utah, at 7:14 a.m. local time on September 10, 2025, heading to Wilmington, Delaware, arriving at 11:51 a.m. Eastern. Web searches reveal discussions of post-shooting flights (e.g., private jet N888KG) and conspiracy theories on X about an Egyptian plane, but no verifiable details match the exact timing and route. Verification would require FAA flight logs, FlightAware data, or FOIA-requested aviation records for that date.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Verify via flight tracking data for tail number SUBTT on September 10th
