### Analysis

According to news reports, Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason stated that authorities had 'good' video footage of the shooter but 'the video footage will not be released to the public at this time.' However, authorities did release some footage (suspect jumping off roof, security camera images). So TPUSA's own internal footage may not have been released, but law enforcement footage was selectively shared. The claim is partially true but lacks full context about what footage exists and what was released.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Check if TPUSA releases event footage post-incident
