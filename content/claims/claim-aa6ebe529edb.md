### Analysis

The Hamptons event (August 4, 2024) hosted by Bill Ackman included approximately 35 conservative influencers and Charlie Kirk. Multiple sources confirm Arynne Wexler (not Aaron - likely transcription error) was involved with the event. According to Candace Owens' account, people at the event confirmed that Arynne Wexler sent out some of the invitations. However, Bill Ackman stated Charlie Kirk sent out the invitations, and Josh Hammer said Kirk personally texted him. The evidence suggests Wexler may have assisted with some invitations while Kirk/Ackman handled others.
