### Analysis

Mixed and contested accounts exist. Candace Owens claimed (Nov 2025) that UVU recommended against the amphitheater for safety reasons but TPUSA insisted on outdoor location. However, UVU officials stated Kirk's team specifically requested the outdoor courtyard space. Security director Brian Harpole stated he was 'initially upset' about the outdoor amphitheater assignment and claims he recommended an indoor secured amphitheater but was denied by university officials. Conflicting narratives make this difficult to verify definitively. Sources: Sportskeeda, Salt Lake Tribune, KSL.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** UVU and TPUSA communications
