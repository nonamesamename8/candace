### Analysis

False: While an Egyptian plane (tail number SU-BTT) was in Provo around the time of Charlie Kirk's assassination, the claim's details are incorrect. The plane departed Provo at 7am local time on Sept 10, well before Kirk was shot that afternoon. FBI Director Kash Patel ruled out any connection between the plane and the shooting. Only one suspect (Tyler Robinson, 22) has been arrested and charged; he acted alone. No evidence of 'four people including a foreign dignitary' or connection to assassination.
