### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including news outlets like The Roys Report and MinistryWatch, confirm that Bruce Hollen, lead pastor of Calvary Chapel of the Woodlands, was arrested in May 2024 on charges related to possession of child pornography (a form of online sex abuse against children) and later sentenced to prison. However, no sources describe the arrest as resulting from a 'sting operation'; it appears to have stemmed from a standard investigation into child pornography possession, making that specific detail inaccurate.
