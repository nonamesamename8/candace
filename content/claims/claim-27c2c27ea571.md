### Analysis

False: Only one person has been arrested and charged with Charlie Kirk's assassination: Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old from Washington County, Utah. Law enforcement has consistently stated he acted alone. No evidence of 'two assassins' or involvement of an 'Israeli' or 'French-Canadian woman.' This appears to be conspiracy theory content. FBI and authorities have ruled out multiple shooters.
