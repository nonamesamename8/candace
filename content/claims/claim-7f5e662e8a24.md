### Analysis

Verified: Benjamin Netanyahu did make a statement about Charlie Kirk after his assassination, and Tucker Carlson publicly disputed Netanyahu's characterization of his relationship with Kirk. Tucker stated 'I was shocked and sickened by the ghoulish, and really repulsive, reaction of the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, to Charlie's death' and accused Netanyahu of trying to 'hijack Charlie's memory.' Tucker claimed that Kirk 'did not like Bibi Netanyahu' and 'was appalled by what was happening in Gaza,' contradicting Netanyahu's portrayal of Kirk as a supporter. Multiple sources confirm Netanyahu made statements that were disputed as misrepresenting his relationship with Kirk. Sources: The Daily Beast, Yahoo News, Times of Israel, Newsweek, The Hill, Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Compare Netanyahu's statements to verifiable facts
