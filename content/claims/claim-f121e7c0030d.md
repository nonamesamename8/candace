### Analysis

While the claim states the family was told by Feds to go into witness protection, public reports confirm witness protection concerns exist in the case. However, sources indicate 'current witness protection programs are designed primarily for federal cases involving organized crime or terrorism' and there were 'limited resources' for this case. The claim suggests the family was convinced to enter protection specifically due to speaking out risks, but this exact framing and motivation hasn't been independently confirmed in public sources. The family did cooperate with authorities to convince Tyler Robinson to surrender.

**Confidence:** Medium
