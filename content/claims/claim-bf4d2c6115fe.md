### Analysis

This claim is substantially true. Derek Maxfield, CEO of Komigo and owner of aircraft N888KG, did issue a statement on Instagram on September 11, 2025. In that statement, he wrote: 'Radar services with air traffic control were terminated in mutual agreement between Denver FAA center and N888KG approximately 10 miles from landing at PGA, which is consistent with generally accepted standard practice when flying in and out of non-towered airports.' While the speaker paraphrases this as 'got permission to turn off transponder services,' Maxfield's actual statement was that radar services were 'terminated in mutual agreement' with ATC, which is a similar concept.
