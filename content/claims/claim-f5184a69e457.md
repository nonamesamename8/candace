### Analysis

The Utah Bureau of EMS lists Level I trauma centers in Utah as Intermountain Medical Center and University of Utah Hospital (not Utah Valley Hospital). Additional sources confirm Utah Valley Hospital is a Level II trauma center, contradicting the claim that it is Level I. Timpanogos Regional Hospital is confirmed as Level III via its official website. Thus, the trauma level for Timpanogos is accurate, but for UV Hospital is not. 'Less equipped' aligns with Level II being higher than Level III. 'Further' is context-dependent and unverifiable without the incident's exact location, though some social media discussions suggest varying distances based on site (e.g., closer from UVU).

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Hospital trauma level certifications and transport records for Charlie Kirk
