**Status:** ⚠️ Mixed

## Claim

> The actual building is called the Bracebridge Complex. It spans over 1 million square feet. It seems it was originally built for the Maryland Bank as their bank headquarters from 1995 until 2006, when Bank of America acquired it. In 2018—remember, that's going to be the year that Macron comes to power—Bank of America pulled out of a few of the buildings and they left it completely empty

### Analysis

MIXED ACCURACY: The Bracebridge Complex does exist at 1100 North King Street in Wilmington, Delaware (not Baltimore as initially searched). It does span over 1 million square feet. However, key details are incorrect: (1) It was built for MBNA (not 'Maryland Bank') as headquarters from 1995 until Bank of America acquired MBNA in 2006. (2) The 2018 timeline is correct - Bank of America did vacate buildings in 2018. (3) Macron became French President in 2017, not 2018.
