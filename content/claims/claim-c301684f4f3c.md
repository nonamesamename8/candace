### Analysis

Unverifiable: This is Candace Owens recounting a private conversation with Charlie Kirk from many years earlier (when he was 23) where he allegedly discussed future plans to 'take control of the RNC'. While Kirk did become influential within Republican circles and his Turning Point USA partnered with the RNC in 2024, there is no way to verify what was said in this private conversation at a Macaroni Grill at Chicago O'Hare. Kirk did speak at the 2024 RNC and had close relationships with Trump campaign officials, but whether he specifically stated he would 'take control of the RNC' in this early conversation cannot be independently confirmed. Sources: Washington Post, National Memo, CBS News on Kirk's 2024 RNC involvement.

**Confidence:** Low
