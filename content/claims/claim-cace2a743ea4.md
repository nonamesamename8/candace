## Claim

> As soon as George Zinn got arrested and that started circling, he ran to someone on campus and said, this is the wrong person. I observed this person with my eyes. You have the complete wrong description. Person you're looking for is wearing tactical gear and is obviously young, because I watched him sprint back after taking the shot.
