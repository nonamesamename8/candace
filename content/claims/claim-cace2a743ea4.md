**Status:** ❓ Unverifiable

## Claim

> As soon as George Zinn got arrested and that started circling, he ran to someone on campus and said, this is the wrong person. I observed this person with my eyes. You have the complete wrong description. Person you're looking for is wearing tactical gear and is obviously young, because I watched him sprint back after taking the shot.

### Analysis

This claim describes a witness allegedly reporting to campus officials that George Zinn was the wrong person and describing tactical gear. While George Zinn was indeed arrested after falsely confessing to the shooting to help the real shooter escape, there is no publicly available evidence of a separate witness making this specific report about tactical gear. The actual shooter Tyler Robinson used a Mauser bolt-action rifle. Without access to law enforcement records, this specific witness account cannot be verified. Sources: The Hill, Deseret News, Newsweek, Fox News.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verification of arrest details and eyewitness accounts
