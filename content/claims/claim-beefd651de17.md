### Analysis

FBI Director Kash Patel did indeed write this in a tweet/X post when announcing the end of the FBI's partnership with the ADL. The exact quote was: 'James Comey wrote love letters to the ADL and embedded FBI agents with them - a group that ran disgraceful ops spying on Americans.' This was widely reported by multiple news outlets including Fox News, Newsweek, and Axios in late September/early October 2025, following the Kirk assassination.
