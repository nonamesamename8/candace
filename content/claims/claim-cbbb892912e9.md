### Analysis

Personal testimony of eyewitness experience. The witness describes hearing a shot from approximately 15 feet away and initially thinking it sounded like a firecracker. This is a subjective personal account of sensory perception during a traumatic event. Cannot be fact-checked through external sources - only the witness knows what they heard and thought in that moment. Multiple news reports confirm witnesses were present at the shooting, including family members who gave statements.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Event layout and witness positions
