### Analysis

This claim references alleged text messages from Charlie Kirk sent the day before his death saying 'they are going to kill me tomorrow.' According to reporting from IBTimes UK, Candace Owens has publicly claimed that someone inside Turning Point USA told her that Kirk sent such messages to security staff and a donor. However, no law enforcement agency, verified insider, or Turning Point USA has publicly confirmed the existence of these messages. The claim remains unverified and unsupported by official sources or evidence presented in court proceedings.
