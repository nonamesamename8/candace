### Analysis

Brian Harpole (Charlie Kirk's head of security) did give an interview to Shawn Ryan (note: spelled 'Shawn' not 'Sean') on the Shawn Ryan Show episode #254 on November 17, 2025 about the Charlie Kirk shooting. The claim that he 'lied badly' is a subjective opinion that cannot be fact-checked without specific assertions being identified. What constitutes a 'lie' vs disputed interpretation vs memory discrepancy would require detailed fact-checking of specific statements made in the interview. Sources: Shawn Ryan Show #254, KSL.com, Newsweek coverage of the interview.
