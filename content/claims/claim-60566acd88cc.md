### Analysis

Partial truth with significant errors: (1) Name spelling: The CIA spokeswoman's name is 'Liz Lyons' (not 'Lyon'). (2) Person's name: The individual is 'Shauni Rae Kerkhoff' (not 'Shawna Rae Kirkhoff'). (3) Organization name: Liz Lyons confirmed Kerkhoff worked in 'campus security' at the CIA, not 'Capitol Protective Services'. Kerkhoff served with U.S. Capitol Police from 2018-2021 (not 2010-2015 as implied). The claim contains some factual elements (CIA spokeswoman Liz Lyons did make a statement about Kerkhoff working in security, Kerkhoff does live in Alexandria, VA) but has multiple significant inaccuracies regarding names, organization, and timeframe.

**Confidence:** High
