### Analysis

This claim alleges that Bill Ackman was 'very upset and threats were made' during a Hamptons meeting with Charlie Kirk. The Grayzone reported on this alleged 'intervention' in early August 2025, citing five sources with 'intimate knowledge' of the meeting. The report claims Ackman and others confronted Kirk about his Israel criticism, with one attendee saying Natasha Hausdorff was 'screaming' at Kirk, and Kirk came away concerned about 'blackmail.' However, Bill Ackman publicly denied these allegations on X, stating 'at no time have I ever threatened Charlie Kirk' and 'I have never blackmailed anyone.' The meeting itself appears to have occurred, but the characterization of 'threats' is disputed by Ackman and relies on anonymous sources. The claim is partially true (a tense meeting occurred) but unverified regarding specific threats.
