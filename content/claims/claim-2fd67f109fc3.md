### Analysis

This is a direct quote from Charlie Kirk about his own behavior and principles, not a factual claim that can be independently verified. It's a statement of personal values and intentions ('I don't stop being friends with people just because people morally blackmail me'). While the quote itself is verifiable as something Kirk said (recorded on video in August 2025), the claim about his actual behavior and motivations is a personal statement that cannot be objectively verified through external evidence.

**Confidence:** High
