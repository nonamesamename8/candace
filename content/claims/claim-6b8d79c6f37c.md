### Analysis

Confirmed by multiple news sources. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Kirk's security team specifically requested an outdoor, 'central' location on campus. According to Salt Lake Tribune and ABC News reporting on released UVU documents, after a July event request, Turning Point scouts arrived in early August and specifically chose the amphitheater location despite UVU's security concerns. Kirk's head of security Brian Harpole acknowledged being initially upset about the amphitheater assignment due to security vulnerabilities but confirmed Kirk wanted to be in that outdoor location to engage with students.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Review internal communications or event planning documents from Turning Point USA
