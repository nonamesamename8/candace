### Analysis

This is a negative claim by Candace Owens about what has not happened (FBI not reaching out to her). While Owens stated on December 5, 2025, that 'There has been no communication with the FBI,' this is her personal testimony about her own experiences. We cannot independently verify whether private communications did or did not occur between Owens and the FBI. The FBI would not publicly confirm or deny contact with individuals in ongoing investigations. This remains a claim about personal experience that cannot be externally verified.

**Confidence:** Low
