### Analysis

Confirmed accurate. The French Ministry of Armed Forces did formally deny training at 'Camp Riley' Minnesota, stating no such camp exists. Camp Ripley (correct spelling) does exist in Minnesota and has hosted international military training. The ministry's statement focused on the spelling error rather than addressing whether any training occurred at Camp Ripley. Multiple sources confirm this response including France24 and fact-checking articles.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify existence of Camp Riley via public records
