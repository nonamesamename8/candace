### Analysis

CORRECTED: Multiple reliable sources (Wikipedia, Fox News, CNN, court documents) confirm Tyler Robinson WAS on UVU campus and fired from the LOSEE CENTER roof, NOT the Woodbury Building. The claim has two parts: (1) 'not on the Woodbury Building' - this part is TRUE (he was on Losee Center), (2) 'not on campus at all' - this part is FALSE (extensive evidence he was on campus). Since claim uses 'or' connecting both parts, and the second part is demonstrably false, the overall claim is FALSE. Robinson entered campus at 11:51 AM, entered Losee Center, climbed to roof via public walkway, and was in prone sniper position by 12:22 PM, approximately 430 feet from Kirk. Evidence includes surveillance footage, forensic evidence on roof, DNA on weapon found nearby, and official court filings.

**Confidence:** High
