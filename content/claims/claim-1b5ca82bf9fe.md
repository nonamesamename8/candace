### Analysis

FBI released multiple videos and images of the Charlie Kirk shooter (Tyler James Robinson, 22-year-old male). All official FBI releases and news coverage show a single male suspect. There is no credible evidence or official acknowledgment of a woman being with the shooter. The FBI released surveillance footage showing the shooter acting alone. This claim appears to be unfounded conspiracy theory with no supporting evidence from FBI or other law enforcement sources.

**Confidence:** High
