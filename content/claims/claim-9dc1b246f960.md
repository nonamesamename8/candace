### Analysis

TMZ obtained doorbell camera footage from West Street in Orem, Utah. Multiple sources confirm that Erwin Steele (homeowner who provided footage) works for Caldera Engineering, which manufactures valves. Sources indicate multiple neighbors on that street, including Samuel Steele, have connections to Caldera Engineering. While 'many employees' cannot be precisely quantified, the connection between the doorbell footage location and Caldera Engineering employees is documented.

**Confidence:** Medium
