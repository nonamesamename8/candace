### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including BBC, The Guardian, Fortune, and official court documents from the Superior Court of Delaware, confirm that Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron filed a 22-count defamation lawsuit against Candace Owens on July 23, 2025, over her claims that Brigitte Macron was born male. This supports the existence of the lawsuit as a verifiable fact. However, the characterization of it as 'ill-advised' is Owens' subjective interpretation and not a verifiable element.

**Confidence:** High
