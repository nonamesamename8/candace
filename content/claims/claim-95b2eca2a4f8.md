### Analysis

This claim refers to specific Wikipedia citation dates for a Rob McCoy entry. While Rob McCoy is confirmed as co-chair of Turning Point Faith and did speak at Charlie Kirk's memorial after the Sept 10, 2025 shooting, the specific claim about Wikipedia citations being dated 'September 10th, 2025' cannot be verified without access to Wikipedia's edit history at the exact time Candace was viewing the page. Wikipedia edit timestamps and citation dates are ephemeral and would require access to Wikipedia's revision history to confirm.

**Confidence:** Low
