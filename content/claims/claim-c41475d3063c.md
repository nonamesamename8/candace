### Analysis

Confirmed FALSE. 'Operation Mockingpastor' is not an official CIA operation - it appears to be a term coined by Candace Owens, playing on the historical 'Operation Mockingbird' (alleged CIA media influence program). While the CIA did historically use clergy as intelligence operatives (documented by 1996 Senate hearings showing CIA used 21 clergy/missionaries), there is no official operation called 'Mockingpastor.' The term appears to be Owens' recent coinage to describe alleged CIA influence over pastors.
