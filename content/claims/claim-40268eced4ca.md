### Analysis

The claim states advertisements began August 31st, but Dairy Queen launched the Maple Cookie Shake on August 29, 2025 (not 2024), not August 31st. Sources: https://www.newsweek.com/dairy-queen-announces-major-menu-change-starting-this-month-2109931 and https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/dairy-queen-fall-menu-2025/ confirm the August 29 launch date. The date is off by 2 days. Note: The episode context suggests this is from 2024, but the product appears to be a 2025 launch.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify Dairy Queen marketing timelines
