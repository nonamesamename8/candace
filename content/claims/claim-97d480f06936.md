### Analysis

TIMELINE ANALYSIS: Evidence shows SU-BTT (Egyptian govt Dassault Falcon 7X) visited Wilmington as early as June 2021 while Dassault facility was still operating. However, Dassault closed ~2021, leaving hangar shuttered until Satys announced takeover in Dec 2024 and opened Oct 2025. Yet SU-BTT continued visiting Wilmington during the gap years (2021-2024) when no authorized maintenance facility existed. This timing discrepancy supports the claim's suggestion that maintenance was not the primary purpose. However, Satys itself IS a legitimate aircraft finishing company, so the claim that Satys 'wasn't established to provide maintenance' is false - Satys is real. The suspicious element is the Egyptian plane's visits BEFORE Satys arrival. CLAIM INTERPRETATION: The speaker appears to conflate two issues: (1) Satys's legitimacy as a company (it IS legitimate), and (2) whether the Egyptian planes' Delaware visits were truly for maintenance (questionable given timing). Marking as MIXED because Satys is legitimate but the broader implication about suspicious activity has some evidentiary support.
