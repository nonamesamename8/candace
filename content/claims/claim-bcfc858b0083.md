> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This claim reports anecdotal information from locals who allegedly emailed Candace Owens saying the FBI instructed them not to share footage. No independent verification exists for these private communications. While it is standard practice for law enforcement to request that evidence not be publicly shared during active investigations to avoid compromising prosecutions, the specific claim about locals being told they were 'not allowed to share it at all' cannot be verified through public sources. This is hearsay from unnamed sources.

**Confidence:** Low
