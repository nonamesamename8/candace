### Analysis

This claim is true. According to court documents and Tyler Robinson's mother's statement to police, Robinson 'had become more political,' leaning left and supporting 'pro-gay and trans rights' over the past year. She told investigators Robinson began dating his roommate Lance Twiggs, a biological male transitioning to female. Robinson told his mother that Charlie Kirk's UVU event was a 'stupid' venue and claimed Kirk 'spreads too much hate.' Multiple news sources confirmed these details from the probable cause affidavit.
