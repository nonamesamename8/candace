### Analysis

This claim is true. On Megyn Kelly's show, Kelly asked Patel directly about Candace Owens's allegations regarding French involvement in Charlie Kirk's assassination. Patel's response was a general statement about investigating all threats: 'Any American that receives a death threat from overseas or anywhere in America is going to be fully investigated. So we're not going to turn our eye away from that investigation or any others.' He did not directly address or deny the French involvement allegation, instead giving what Owens herself characterized as a 'sidestepped' answer.
