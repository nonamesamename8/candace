### Analysis

Multiple news sources, including Hindustan Times, Times of India, and Black Westchester, report that Candace Owens' podcast reached #1 in the world based on Podscribe's metrics for downloads and views per episode in November 2025, supporting the claim in that specific context. However, conflicting information from X posts and other checks indicate it was #1 only briefly on Podscribe (which may not filter fake engagement), and overall rankings (e.g., on Spotify or general charts) show it lower, with Joe Rogan as #1, making the absolute 'number one in the world' claim inaccurate or overstated.

**Confidence:** Medium
