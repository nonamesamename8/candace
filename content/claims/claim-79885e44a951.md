### Analysis

This claim relies on anonymous sources within Turning Point's faith department. Web research confirms Lance Wallnau's connection to TPUSA Faith, his involvement with Rob McCoy (co-founder of TPUSA Faith), and his promotion of the Seven Mountains Mandate that influenced Charlie Kirk. However, the specific financial claims about Wallnau funding TPUSA Faith operations cannot be verified through public sources. TPUSA Faith had a budget of 6.4 million dollars (2021), but donor breakdowns are not publicly available. The claim about private funding amounts is unverifiable without internal documents or financial disclosures.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Turning Point USA financial disclosures or insider confirmations
