### Analysis

The article reports that ultra-Zionist billionaire Robert Shillman (likely a reference to 'Bob Shulman,' possibly a misspelling) ended funding for Turning Point USA due to Charlie Kirk's increasingly critical views on Israel. Additional posts found on X and other web sources, including leaks from group chat messages shared by Candace Owens, specify that Shillman withdrew a $2 million pledge specifically because Kirk refused to cancel Tucker Carlson from appearing at events. This aligns with the claim's details, though the exact name 'Shulman' appears to be a variant or error for 'Shillman.' Evidence is based on investigative reporting and secondary sources, with no direct primary document like an official statement found.

**Confidence:** Medium

**Source:** [Top pro-Israel TPUSA donor terminated support for Kirk in days before death, sources say - The Grayzone](https://thegrayzone.com/2025/09/22/israel-tpusa-donor-terminated-kirk/)

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify donation withdrawal records from Turning Point USA or Shulman's statements
