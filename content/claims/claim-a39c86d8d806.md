### Analysis

This appears to be a conversational aside directed at someone named 'Project Constitution' in the chat about plane tail numbers (BTU vs BTT). Without access to the specific chat messages or knowing what planes are being referenced, this cannot be independently verified. The context suggests this is about connecting flight records or registration data, but the claim lacks sufficient detail to verify what 'BTU' and 'BTT' refer to or whether the correction is accurate.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verification through aviation records or investigations into the planes mentioned.
