### Analysis

The claim about a military-contracted plane departing Biggs Army Airfield at 6:13 a.m. and dipping to 300 feet over Provo airport is supported by flight tracking data. The aircraft (tail N1098L, owned by LASAI Aviation LLC, a defense contractor) did make unusual low-altitude maneuvers over Provo Municipal Airport on September 10, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the flight path, though the specific departure time and exact altitude require verification from primary flight tracking data. The plane was contracted for military/intelligence purposes.
