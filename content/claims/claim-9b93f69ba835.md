### Analysis

Rob McCoy's claim that Mikey called him 'the minute Charlie was shot' is contradicted by multiple sources. Andrew Kolvet (TPUSA executive producer) confirmed that Mikey called Erika Kirk first, following Charlie's prior instructions. Erika Kirk herself confirmed receiving the first call from Mikey. Both Rob McCoy and Erika Kirk claimed to have received calls 'at the exact moment' of the shooting, which is impossible. Video evidence shows Mikey walking away on the phone immediately after the shooting, but he could not have called both people simultaneously.

**Confidence:** High
