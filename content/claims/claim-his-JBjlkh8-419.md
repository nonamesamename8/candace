No reliable sources, such as news articles or official statements, were found detailing the planning timeline for the Utah Valley University TPUSA event or comparing it to typical TPUSA event planning. Web searches and X posts provided context on TPUSA events but lacked specific evidence on when the UVU event was decided or scheduled.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Review TPUSA event planning emails and schedules.
