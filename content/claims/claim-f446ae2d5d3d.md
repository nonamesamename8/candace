### Analysis

This is a claim made by Andrew Kolvet (TPUSA spokesman) on The Charlie Kirk Show about Charlie Kirk's principles. While Kolvet stated this and mentioned they refused foreign money and turned down wires, this is testimonial evidence about internal organizational policies that cannot be independently verified through public records or foreign agent registration databases. No specific TPUSA foreign donation policy documentation was found in public sources.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Review Turning Point financial records
