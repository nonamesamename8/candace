### Analysis

This claim is substantiated by multiple news sources. Christopher Moseley, husband of DuPont heiress Lisa Dean Moseley, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire in the death of Patricia Margello, a 45-year-old ex-prostitute. Margello's body was found Aug. 6, 1998, in a Las Vegas motel. Moseley admitted paying 5,000 to have her killed because his stepson Dean MacGuigan (Lisa's son) was dating her. Moseley died in federal prison in 2004 while serving a 16.5-year sentence. The claim accurately reflects reporting from Dominick Dunne in Vanity Fair and other news outlets.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Vanity Fair article and Las Vegas court records
