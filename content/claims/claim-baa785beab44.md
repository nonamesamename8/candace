### Analysis

This claim describes a private conversation between Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk (who is deceased) about Nick Fuentes. There are no public records, recordings, or independent witnesses that could verify this private conversation. The claim is inherently unverifiable as it relies solely on the speaker's personal recollection of a private discussion. Andrew Kolvet is mentioned as someone who could confirm parts of the account, but that doesn't make the specific claim about what Charlie did or didn't say verifiable through independent sources.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Candace Owens' interview date with Nick Fuentes and communications with Charlie Kirk
