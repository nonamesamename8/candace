## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

Partially verifiable: Caldera Engineering exists in Provo/Orem area and does employ multiple Steele family members (Keri Steele as HR Manager, Erwin Steele in Project Management). However, the claim that 'virtually everyone on that block works for that company' is based on an anonymous local source and cannot be independently verified through public records or company employee directories.

**Confidence:** Medium

**Source:** [Caldera Engineering Official Website](https://calderaengineering.com/)

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Employment records or local confirmation for Caldera Engineering and Steele family
