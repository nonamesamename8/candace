### Analysis

While Candace Owens alleges she has 80-150 text messages showing conflict between Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro during TPUSA's early days, no independent verification of these specific claims exists in public sources. Web searches found no corroboration of the alleged messages or specific instances of Shapiro working to hinder TPUSA. Public record shows Shapiro and Kirk had a 13-year relationship starting when Kirk was 18, and Shapiro praised Kirk's potential. IMDB references allegations about Shapiro trying to 'kill' careers, though context is unclear. Without access to the actual text messages or independent confirmation, this remains unverifiable.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Candace Owens' text messages with Charlie Kirk
