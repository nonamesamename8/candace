### Analysis

The claim says 'clearing like a hundred million a year' but the evidence shows TPUSA had 5 million in revenue in 2024 (not clearing/net profit). Their expenses were 1 million, leaving only about  million in net assets gained that year. 'Clearing' typically means net profit, not gross revenue. The organization's revenue was below 00M, and their actual profit/clearing was far below that.
