### Analysis

Andrew Kolvet, a Turning Point USA spokesman, did publicly state that 'the coroner did find the bullet just beneath the skin' in statements to the media. However, the official autopsy report has not been released publicly as Utah law classifies autopsy reports as non-public. The claim accurately represents what Kolvet said, but the underlying assertion cannot be independently verified as the actual coroner's findings remain confidential.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Release of coroner's report
