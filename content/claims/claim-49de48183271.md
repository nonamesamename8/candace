### Analysis

The speaker claims to have tweeted 'No person, nobody, no nation anywhere in the world has a right to commit genocide.' However, the actual tweet from November 3, 2023 stated: 'No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever.' The wording is different - the actual tweet said 'No government' not 'No person, nobody, no nation.' While the substance is similar, the exact quote is inaccurate.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify the tweet's existence and content on social media archives
