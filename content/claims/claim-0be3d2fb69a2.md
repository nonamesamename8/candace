### Analysis

The claim states Operation Bright Star took place from August 29 to September 10, 2024. However, Operation Bright Star is a biennial exercise that did NOT occur in 2024. Bright Star 23 took place Aug 31-Sept 14, 2023, and Bright Star 25 took place Aug 28-Sept 10, 2025. The dates given (Aug 29-Sept 10) roughly match the 2025 exercise dates, but the year 2024 is factually incorrect. Sources: U.S. CENTCOM press releases, U.S. Embassy Egypt, and Wikipedia confirm the biennial schedule with no 2024 iteration.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** US-Egypt military exercise schedules
