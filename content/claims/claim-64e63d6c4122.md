### Analysis

FALSE: The actual Chief Medical Examiner who handled Charlie Kirk's autopsy in Utah was Dr. Deirdre Amaro (not Dr. Lydia Smith-Amaro). No records exist of a medical examiner named 'Dr. Lydia Smith-Amaro' connected to this case. Dr. Deirdre Amaro is Utah's Chief Medical Examiner and serves on Governor Cox's Fentanyl Task Force. The military connections and Ericsson family claims cannot be verified for any medical examiner in this case. Sources: Crossroads Report, Factually.co fact checks on Charlie Kirk autopsy.

**Confidence:** High
