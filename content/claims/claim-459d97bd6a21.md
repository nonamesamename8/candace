### Analysis

This claim describes a detailed timeline of events following Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025. The basic facts are confirmed: Kirk was shot at 12:23 PM and within seconds was carried to an SUV (CBS News reports 12:23:55 PM - approximately 40-55 seconds). George Zinn did falsely confess and was arrested in handcuffs, with widely circulated video showing his pants falling down during the arrest. The timeline details align with documented events, though exact timings (40 seconds, 10 seconds, 1 minute 15 seconds, 1 minute 48 seconds) appear to be Candace Owens' own analysis of video footage rather than officially confirmed timestamps. The sequence of events described is substantially accurate.
