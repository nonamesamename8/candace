### Analysis

This claim is FALSE. Research shows no evidence that Turning Point USA issued an official organizational statement supporting Candace Owens' 'Christ is King' controversy when she was fired from The Daily Wire in March 2024. The timeline shows: 1) Owens was fired from Daily Wire on March 22, 2024, 2) The 'Christ is King' controversy erupted online around March 24-25, 2024 with users defending Owens against Ben Shapiro, 3) While Owens has maintained connections with TPUSA and spoke at their events in 2024, no official TPUSA organizational statement of support for the 'Christ is King' matter has been documented. The speaker may be conflating Owens' personal relationship with Charlie Kirk or TPUSA with an official organizational statement. Sources: Wikipedia, Know Your Meme, EEW Magazine.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verifiable via TPUSA's public statements
