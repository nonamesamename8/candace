### Analysis

Cannot verify this claim about a specific individual (referred to as 'Nick') working on Phil Lyman's 2024 gubernatorial campaign. While Phil Lyman did run for Utah Governor in 2024 against Spencer Cox (and lost in the Republican primary), public campaign staff records do not list campaign workers by name. The individual's identity is protected in the podcast. This is a personal/private claim that cannot be independently verified through public sources.

**Confidence:** High
