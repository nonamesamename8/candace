## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This is explicitly presented as hearsay/theory from locals ('locals are theorizing', 'we have no proof of this', 'this is what they are saying'). The speaker is attributing this claim to others, not asserting it as fact. The existence of a vacant university-owned property near where the gun was found cannot be verified through public records without specific property addresses. As stated theory/speculation rather than factual assertion, this cannot be verified.

**Confidence:** High
