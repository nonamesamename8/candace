### Analysis

This is a statement by Candace Owens describing her characterization of people who are investigating Charlie Kirk's death. She explicitly states on her podcast that 'there is an underground movement of truth-tellers' including 'mom sleuths to government employees, like he said, to personal assistants, to Turning Point USA donors.' This is her subjective characterization of the investigation participants, and she did make this statement as claimed.

**Confidence:** High
