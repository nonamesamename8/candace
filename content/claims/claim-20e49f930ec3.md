### Analysis

While Candace Owens did work for Turning Point USA and toured with Charlie Kirk on the Campus Clash tour as co-headliners, there is no publicly available data to verify the specific claim that she headlined more TPUSA campus tours than any other individual. Multiple sources confirm she co-headlined tours with Kirk (BuzzFeed, CU Boulder announcements), but comparative tour statistics are not publicly documented. Sources: BuzzFeedNews, CU Boulder Today articles on Campus Clash tour.

**Confidence:** Medium
