### Analysis

This claim by Candace Owens contradicts official charging documents. Per charging documents and multiple news sources (ABC, CNN, CBS), Tyler Robinson's parents recognized him from news images, convinced him to come to their home, and he allegedly confessed to them saying Kirk 'spreads too much hate.' His parents then facilitated his surrender through a retired detective. However, Owens claims via unnamed sources that parents don't believe their son is guilty and that he disputed committing the crime. The official law enforcement account directly contradicts Owens' assertion, but we cannot definitively verify what the parents privately believe versus what they facilitated through law enforcement. The claim mixes factual dispute with unverifiable internal beliefs.

**Confidence:** Medium
