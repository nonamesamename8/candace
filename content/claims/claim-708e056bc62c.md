### Analysis

Andrew Kolvet, TPUSA producer, confirmed on The Charlie Kirk Show that a TPUSA tech staffer removed SD cards from cameras after the shooting. Tyler Bowyer (TPUSA COO) identified the person as Charlie's head of tech. The staffer explained he took them to prevent theft, stating 'I know people can be evil,' and to preserve the 4k footage. The SD cards were subsequently turned over to the FBI. Multiple sources (TRUTH Press, Gateway Pundit, USSA News) confirm this account.
