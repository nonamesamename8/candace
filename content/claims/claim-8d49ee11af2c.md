### Analysis

The claim references a social media post showing Mike Mitchell's retirement celebration. While there are LinkedIn profiles and employment records for individuals named Mike Mitchell in various Washington County locations, there is no publicly available news article or official announcement confirming a Washington County, Utah detective named Mike Mitchell retiring in January 2024. The only evidence appears to be the social media post mentioned in the podcast transcript. Sources: LinkedIn profiles, Washington County Oregon employment records (no Utah confirmation found).

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Retirement announcement or department records
