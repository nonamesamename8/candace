### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as official FBI statements, Utah government documents, or established news outlets (e.g., ABC News, The New York Times, BBC), confirm or refute the specific claim of FBI exerting pressure on Utah authorities to declare the Charlie Kirk assassination case closed as a lone gunman incident. Web searches and X posts reveal official narratives describing the suspect Tyler James Robinson as acting alone, with FBI collaboration in the investigation, but only unsubstantiated conspiracy theories on X suggest cover-ups or undue influence. Verification would require internal communications, such as leaked emails, FOIA-requested FBI or Utah state documents, or whistleblower testimony from involved authorities to confirm any pressure.
