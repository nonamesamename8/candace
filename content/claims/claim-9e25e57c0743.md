### Analysis

FBI Special Agent Robert Bohls held a press conference at 7:19 a.m. Mountain Time on September 11, 2025, announcing the recovery of the weapon. The FBI released photos of the person of interest at 10:00 a.m. Mountain Time, followed by a 100k reward announcement at 10:45 a.m. The claim states the New York Post published an exclusive photo at 9:21 a.m. Mountain Time (11:21 a.m. Eastern), which would be BEFORE the FBI released official photos at 10 a.m. I found references to the New York Post covering the gun discovery but no confirmation of an 'exclusive' photo at 9:21 a.m. The timing discrepancy (NYP publishing before FBI release) raises questions but cannot be definitively confirmed or refuted.

**Confidence:** Medium
