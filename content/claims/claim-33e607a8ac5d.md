### Analysis

This claim is part of Candace Owens' unverified conspiracy theory about Egyptian military planes tracking Charlie Kirk. According to Yahoo News, Sportskeeda, and FactCheck.co reporting, Owens made claims about Egyptian military aircraft but provided no verifiable evidence. No official law enforcement, government agency, or independent verification confirms the passenger count claims. Aviation analysts note Egyptian military planes fly internationally for routine logistics but dismiss unverified ties to Kirk's assassination. The specific passenger count claim cannot be independently verified through reliable sources.

**Confidence:** Low
