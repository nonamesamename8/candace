### Analysis

This claim presents very specific transponder data for an alleged Egyptian military plane (SU-BND) on September 10, 2025. Web search confirms Candace Owens promoted conspiracy theories about Egyptian planes (SU-BND and SU-BTT) being connected to Kirk's assassination. However, her claims were debunked - she confused UTC time with local Utah time, and one plane departed Provo at 7 a.m., hours before the shooting. Law enforcement sources told news outlets there is no evidence of foreign involvement. The specific transponder times cited in this claim come from Owens' analysis of flight tracking data, but her methodology was flawed and her conclusions were rejected by fact-checkers. Without independent verification of this data or its relevance, the claim is unverifiable.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** ADS-B Exchange raw data for Provo FBO on September 10, 2025 (Utah local time)
