### Analysis

CONFIRMED: Context shows this is a student asking Eric Trump about 'your father' (Donald Trump) taking 30M from pro-Israel groups. Track AIPAC analysis confirms 'more than 30 million in spending by pro-Israel interest groups benefiting President Donald Trump since 2020,' primarily from Miriam Adelson's Preserve America PAC (15M+). Previous verdict incorrectly assumed this was about Charlie Kirk's father and cited wrong amount (0M vs 30M).

**Confidence:** High
