### Analysis

No public information found about a company called 'WireFi' as a Turning Point USA sponsor or at the Charlie Kirk event. The specific claim about a man in a WireFi shirt taking photos/texts after the shooting cannot be verified through news coverage, TPUSA sponsor lists, or event documentation. This appears to be based on video footage analysis mentioned in the episode but not corroborated by independent sources.
