## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This claim is inherently unverifiable as it makes assertions about Charlie Kirk's internal feelings and subjective experiences ('change of heart', 'felt...blackmailed'). These are personal mental/emotional states that cannot be objectively confirmed through external sources. While someone may have claimed Charlie felt this way, his actual feelings and subjective experience cannot be independently verified. This is a statement about internal psychological states, not observable facts.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Release of private communications or witness accounts
