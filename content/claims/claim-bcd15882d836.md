### Analysis

This claim asks whether Charlie Kirk was offered more money and funding from Benjamin Netanyahu. The transcript context shows Candace Owens asking this as a question to attendees of a Netanyahu-Kirk meeting, not making a factual assertion. The context reads 'Conspicuously missing is you not addressing whether or not Charlie was offered more money and funding from Benjamin Netanyahu. Could you help us out?' This is a question seeking information, not a verifiable factual claim. Without access to private meeting details or statements from participants, this cannot be independently verified.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Confirm with Bill Ackman or Charlie Kirk
