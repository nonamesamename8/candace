### Analysis

Edward Bernays, Sigmund Freud's nephew, is widely recognized as 'the father of public relations' and a pioneer of modern propaganda. Bernays applied Freud's theories about unconscious psychological motivations to public relations and mass persuasion. His works 'Crystallizing Public Opinion' (1923) and 'Propaganda' (1928) were foundational texts. Life magazine named him one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century. However, it was Edward Bernays specifically (not the broader 'Freud family') who created these propaganda techniques. Sigmund Freud himself was not directly involved in propaganda development.
