### Analysis

Multiple sources confirm Charlie Kirk was wearing a St. Michael pendant when he died on September 10, 2025. According to his wife Erika Kirk in Fox News interviews and reported by Catholics For Catholics, ChurchPop, and other outlets, Charlie wore the St. Michael cross necklace that Erika had given him. Erika stated 'He loved Saint Michael...He never took it off again, until he was assassinated and the people caring for him ripped it off as they tried to save his life.' The pendant, now worn by Erika, still has Charlie's blood on it from that day.
