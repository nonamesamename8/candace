### Analysis

An Egyptian government-owned Dassault Falcon 7X with registration SU-BTT did travel from Provo, Utah to Wilmington, Delaware around the timeframe described. Multiple sources confirm the aircraft's movements (jetphotos.com/registration/SU-BTT) and that it is one of four Falcon jets owned by the Egyptian government. The plane was photographed at Wilmington New Castle County Airport on August 23, 2025. While some timeline details have been disputed in fact-checks, the core assertion about the plane's route from Provo to Wilmington is supported by flight tracking data and photographic evidence.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Flight tracking data
