### Analysis

Tim Pool did accuse Candace Owens of damaging the conservative movement through her investigation into Charlie Kirk's assassination. Multiple sources confirm Pool called Owens an 'evil scumbag' and stated 'This conservative movement is fractured, it's fried... Republicans are on track to lose the midterms. They were actually trending in the other direction until Charlie Kirk was murdered.' Pool asserted that conspiracy theories about Kirk's death were causing supporters to stop donating to TPUSA and threatening Republican electoral prospects. The claim accurately reflects Pool's public statements.

**Confidence:** High
