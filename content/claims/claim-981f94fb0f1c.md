### Analysis

Partially accurate but timing is off. According to multiple sources, Charlie Kirk announced setting up a DOGE-style efficiency department at TPUSA on September 2, 2025, via internal memo naming Justin Strife as COO to lead the initiative. However, Kirk died on September 10, 2025 - meaning this was 8 days before his death, not 7 days as claimed. The memo's existence and Kirk's concerns about TPUSA finances are documented in multiple news reports, though TPUSA leadership has not officially confirmed the memo's authenticity.
