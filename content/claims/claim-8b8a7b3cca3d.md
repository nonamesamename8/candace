### Analysis

The claim that intelligence agencies (FBI/CIA) recruit heavily from LDS/Mormon communities, particularly at BYU, is well-documented. Historical sources include: a 1971 Ramparts magazine article stating LDS provided 'some of their best men' to CIA/FBI; a 1981 AP story reporting 'CIA does some of its most successful recruiting in predominantly LDS Utah'; and a 2017 book 'FBI and Religion' dedicating a chapter to this connection. Deseret News, Atlas Obscura, and LDS Living have all reported on this recruitment pattern. The reasons cited include foreign language skills from missionary service, abstinence from drugs/alcohol, clean backgrounds for security clearance, and cultural fit. While exact numbers aren't public, the pattern is well-established in reporting.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify recruitment practices of intelligence agencies from LDS communities and specific campuses
