### Analysis

Verified FALSE. The context shows this claim is actually what critics were saying about Candace Owens ('Trump never called her'), which she is refuting. Multiple credible sources confirm Trump DID call Candace Owens about Brigitte Macron in February 2025. Sources including Mediaite, TMZ, The Pink News, and The Advocate all report that Owens claims Trump called her on February 26, 2025 asking her to stop talking about Brigitte Macron. The White House declined to comment on the alleged call. The claim as stated is false because Trump did call her (according to Owens and not denied by the White House).

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Confirmation from Trump or call records
