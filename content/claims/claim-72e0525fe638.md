### Analysis

The claim that 'evidence shows' Epstein was a creation of intelligence agencies is partially supported but overstated. Documentary evidence exists of Epstein's connections to Israeli elites: Drop Site News investigations revealed Israeli intelligence officer Yoni Koren lived at Epstein's apartment for weeks (2013-2016); hacked emails from Ehud Barak show Epstein brokering Israel-Mongolia security deals and Israel-Russia backchannels. However, no public documents show formal recruitment, payment records, or operational orders. Former Mossad director Ari Ben-Menashe claimed Epstein worked for Israeli intelligence since the 1980s, but this remains unconfirmed. The evidence shows access and influence with Israeli political/intelligence figures, but not definitive proof of being 'created by' or formally employed by any intelligence agency. 'Mixed' because evidence of connections exists, but not of creation/employment.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Release of Epstein-related documents or investigations
