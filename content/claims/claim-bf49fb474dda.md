### Analysis

Candace Owens was suspended from YouTube for one week and fully demonetized in September 2024 following violations of YouTube's policies, particularly after her interview with Kanye West that included antisemitic content. YouTube removed at least one video for 'claims that Jewish people control the media.' YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon confirmed the suspension and demonetization. This was not a permanent ban but a temporary suspension with demonetization. The term 'canceled' as used by Owens refers to this suspension and demonetization action.
