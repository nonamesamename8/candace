### Analysis

MIXED: US intelligence did obtain information about an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, which led Secret Service to increase security. HOWEVER, there is NO CONNECTION between Thomas Matthew Crooks (the Butler shooter) and any Iranian plot. Crooks acted alone. A separate Pakistani man with alleged Iran ties was arrested in a different assassination plot on July 12, 2024, but not connected to the Butler shooting.

**Confidence:** Medium

  - Confirms Iranian plot intelligence existed but notes no connection to Crooks/Butler shooting

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify through media reports or official statements from that time
