### Analysis

Confirmed true. Jack Posobiec served as a United States Navy intelligence officer. NBC News reported he was a 'Navy Intel Officer' and Military Times confirmed his service. He enlisted in U.S. Navy Reserves on May 25, 2010, was commissioned as an officer on October 31, 2013, and reached the rank of lieutenant junior grade. He was assigned to Office of Naval Intelligence from March 2014-March 2017, specifically at the Kennedy Irregular Warfare Center. He deployed for 10 months to Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay performing human intelligence analysis. Posobiec has publicly acknowledged this service and resigned from ONI in March 2017. The claim correctly states he 'was' (past tense) a naval intelligence officer and that he has never denied it.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify Jack Posobiec's military background through public records.
