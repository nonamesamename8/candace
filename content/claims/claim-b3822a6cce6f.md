### Analysis

Partially verifiable: Candace Owens did claim that the blue plane (SU-BND) powered on and was transponding at Duncan Aviation FBO on the day of Charlie Kirk's assassination. However, FBI Director Kash Patel and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy have stated that investigations into transponder-related conspiracy theories found no evidence of suspicious activity. Patel stated that after interviews with pilots and FAA consultation, transponder gaps were caused by incomplete flight data in rural areas, not intentional shutoff. The FAA confirmed transponders were never turned off. While Owens made specific claims about the plane's transponder activity, official investigations have disputed the suspicious nature of these activities.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** ADS-B Exchange data for SU-BND on September 10, 2025
