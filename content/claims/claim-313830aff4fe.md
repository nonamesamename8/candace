### Analysis

False: Tyler Bowyer was NOT the only person with Charlie Kirk before TPUSA grew. Bill Montgomery, a retired marketing entrepreneur and Tea Party activist, co-founded TPUSA with Kirk in June 2012, immediately after Kirk graduated high school. Bowyer met Kirk in 2014 (two years after founding) when Bowyer was chairman of Maricopa County Republican Committee, and joined TPUSA in 2015, becoming COO in 2017. While Bowyer is the 'longest tenured employee,' he was not present at the founding. Sources: Wikipedia, Britannica, Washington Post, TPUSA official site.

**Confidence:** High
