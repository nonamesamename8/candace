### Analysis

No primary sources, such as news articles, court documents, or official statements, were found in the provided web results to confirm or refute the specific claim about Rob McCoy's long-term friendship with Thomas Camino post-conviction, or Camino's alleged involvement in the Calvary Chapel Church's Home Fellowship program granting access to children in 2022. The linked source is a 2022 news article profiling McCoy but does not mention Camino or the controversy. Posts on X discuss similar allegations stemming from the podcast, but they are not reliable evidence and reflect public sentiment rather than verified facts. To verify, would require access to 2022 news archives (e.g., local California outlets like VC Star or LA Times), court records of Camino's conviction, or official church statements/records from Calvary Chapel regarding the Home Fellowship program and any related controversies.
