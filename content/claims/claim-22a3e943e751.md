### Analysis

Candace Owens alleges an unnamed whistleblower claimed the Egyptian military plane carried subcontractors dropped off in Provo. The plane (SU-BTT, Dassault Falcon 7X) did land at Provo Municipal Airport on Sept 4, 2025, and Duncan Aviation confirmed it was there for scheduled maintenance per a long-standing service contract. However, the specific claim about military subcontractors being dropped off cannot be independently verified. No official investigation or law enforcement has corroborated this claim, and aviation authorities have not confirmed the presence of military personnel. The maintenance explanation is documented and the plane's movements are consistent with routine servicing.
