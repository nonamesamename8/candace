### Analysis

Verified as MIXED. The claim is partially accurate but contains a specific date that cannot be verified. Multiple sources confirm that Sean Feucht joined TPUSA Faith as a 'Faith Contributor' in February 2023 and headed the Kingdom to Capitol Tour. However, the specific announcement date of February 28, 2023 could not be verified. The official kickoff event in the U.S. Capitol rotunda occurred on March 9, 2023 with seven members of Congress attending. Sources confirm Feucht teamed with TPUSA Faith for a 50-state tour starting in 2023, and he became 'the face of' this tour, but the precise February 28 date is not substantiated. Sources: People For the American Way, Rolling Stone, A Public Witness.

**Confidence:** Medium
