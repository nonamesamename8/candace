### Analysis

This statement comes from Rob O'Neill, a verified former Navy SEAL with extensive combat experience. The factual component - that Rob O'Neill has shot people in combat - is consistent with his documented military service record including 400+ combat missions and multiple combat decorations. However, his observation about shirt movement ('their shirts didn't move like that') is expert analysis based on comparing past experiences to video footage, which is professional opinion rather than objectively verifiable fact. The claim combines verified experience (he has shot people) with subjective comparative analysis.

**Confidence:** Medium

**Source:** [N/A](N/A)

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Ballistic review of shirt movement in video
