### Analysis

This claim asserts that the NSA and Kash Patel know about 12 Israeli cell phones being present at Utah Valley University on September 10, 2025 during Charlie Kirk's assassination. This type of classified intelligence information, if it exists, would not be publicly available. No public reports, official statements, or reliable sources confirm or deny this specific claim about cell phone tracking data. The claim is inherently unverifiable as it involves alleged classified intelligence information.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Official statements from NSA or Kash Patel
