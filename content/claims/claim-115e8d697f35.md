### Analysis

The claim refers to a Dairy Queen location where Tyler Robinson was allegedly photographed at 6:38pm on Sept 10, 2025 (the day of the shooting). Fact-checkers confirmed the Dairy Queen in Orem was 'less than four miles' from where Kirk was killed at Utah Valley University. Google Maps shows typical drive time from UVU campus to the Orem Dairy Queen locations ranges from 8-17 minutes depending on the specific location and traffic. The 17-minute estimate is within reasonable range for this distance.

**Confidence:** Medium
