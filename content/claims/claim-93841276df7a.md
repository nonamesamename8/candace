Confirmed. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square made .6 billion from a 7 million credit default swap bet in March 2020 during COVID market crash. He later made another .25 billion from interest rate bets, totaling approximately .85-4 billion in pandemic-era profits. While not 'billions' from the initial trade alone, his total COVID-era gains were indeed billions.
