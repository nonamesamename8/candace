### Analysis

CLAIM EXTRACTION ERROR: Transcript says TPUSA 'involved in politics in Scottsdale' - NOT 'headquartered' there. Candace's actual statements: (1) Falcone 'reappeared in Scottsdale' after French legal troubles - historically true but current residence uncertain (evidence suggests overseas). (2) TPUSA involved in Scottsdale politics - TRUE (events there, Kirk lived there). HQ is actually Phoenix.

**Confidence:** High
