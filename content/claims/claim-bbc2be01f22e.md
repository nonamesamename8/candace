### Analysis

Confirmed by official documents. According to event planning documents released by UVU and reported by ABC News and Police1, a TPUSA UVU chapter member submitted an online form in early July 2025 requesting the event. Turning Point USA quickly approved and sent scouts to campus. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Kirk's security team began coordinating with UVU in early August, with subsequent conversations updating attendance estimates from 600 to 1,500-2,000. The timeline of July request followed by early August scouting is documented in official records.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Internal TPUSA records or communications
