### Analysis

FBI Director Kash Patel stated Robinson was apprehended in '33 hours' and emphasized this timeline at press conference. However, the claim about '33rd hour' being at 9:23 p.m. appears to be commentary/calculation from the podcast, not from official sources. The 33-hour timeframe itself is confirmed.

**Confidence:** Medium
