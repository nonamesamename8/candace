### Analysis

The claim states that George Zinn's endorsement on Phil Lyman's website was present in the Wayback Machine archive from at least June 6, 2024. While multiple sources confirm that George Zinn did endorse Phil Lyman on lymanforutah.com and that this endorsement remained on the site after Zinn's arrest following Charlie Kirk's assassination, I could not independently verify the specific Wayback Machine archive date of June 6, 2024 through public sources. The speaker claims to have shown this in the episode. To fully verify, one would need to check archive.org directly for the specific snapshot date.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Wayback Machine archive verification
