### Analysis

Marked MIXED. The claim text appears garbled/incomplete but TPUSA did receive substantial donations after Kirk's assassination. Multiple sources confirm millions in donations: fundraisers raised over M total, including .4M on GiveSendGo and .3M on Friends of Kirk Family fundraiser. However, the specific claim of 'tens of millions in two weeks' is not directly confirmed - sources describe 'surge' and 'flood' of donations but don't specify exact amounts in first two weeks. The claim text also appears incomplete/malformed.
