### Analysis

The claim alleges that a Wikipedia citation dated November 24, 2024 for Rob McCoy's co-founder status doesn't actually support the claim in the source article. Without access to: (1) Wikipedia's detailed edit history showing the specific citation #54 added on September 11, 2025, and (2) the actual article dated November 24, 2024 that was cited, this cannot be independently verified. However, the core fact that Rob McCoy co-founded TPUSA Faith is CONFIRMED by multiple reliable sources including the official TPUSA Faith website and news reports. The issue being raised is about citation accuracy and timing of Wikipedia edits, not about whether McCoy is actually co-founder. This is a claim about Wikipedia editorial practices that would require access to Wikipedia's version history and the specific source article to verify. Sources: TPUSA Faith website confirms co-founder status; Wikipedia edit history not accessible via web search.

**Confidence:** Medium
