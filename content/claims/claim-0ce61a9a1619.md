### Analysis

This claim alleges that Tyler Robinson (NOT Lance Twiggs as the context might suggest) 'showed up on drugs' and was 'spouting about political stuff' on Easter Sunday (presumably Easter 2025, which was April 20, 2025). The claim is attributed to anonymous family sources speaking to Candace Owens. Extensive searches of official sources including court documents, FBI statements, media reports, and Robinson's family interviews do not mention any Easter Sunday incident involving drugs. While Robinson's mother confirmed to investigators that he had become 'more political over the last year,' no public records corroborate the specific Easter Sunday drug incident. Without official documentation or named sources, this remains unverifiable hearsay.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Allegedly; confirm with witnesses.
