## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This claim reports that unnamed sources ('mommy sleuths and daddy sleuths' and 'young women') told Candace Owens about a French-American donor named Pierre, which she later connected to Pierre du Pont. While the du Pont family is indeed a prominent French-American family with a history of philanthropy, fact-checking sources found no verified evidence of any Pierre DuPont being a TPUSA donor. The claim is based entirely on anonymous sources whose statements cannot be independently verified, and no public records or reporting confirm this alleged donor relationship.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** TPUSA donor records or IRS filings
