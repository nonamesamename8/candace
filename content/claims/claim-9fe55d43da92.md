### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including local news outlets and biographical profiles, confirm that Rob McCoy served as Mayor of Thousand Oaks from December 2018 through December 2019. The Borderline Bar and Grill shooting occurred on November 7, 2018, so his assumption of the mayoral role in December 2018 is approximately one month later. In Thousand Oaks, the mayor is selected annually by the city council from its members, which aligns with the claim's timeline and use of 'elected' in the context of council selection.

**Confidence:** High
