### Analysis

Partially confirmed: Miriam Adelson did donate ~06M to Trump 2024. Reports in May 2024 suggested she was conditioning support on West Bank annexation, but her spokesperson denied this. She has consistently advocated for annexation and against Palestinian state. 'Explicit understanding' is unverified.

**Confidence:** Medium
