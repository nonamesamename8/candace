### Analysis

Confirmed. Charlie Kirk was vocally critical of Ukraine and Zelensky in 2023. Documented evidence includes his November 6, 2023 tweet questioning Zelensky's commitment to elections, calling Zelensky a 'CIA puppet' and 'gangster,' accusing him of sending people to 'senseless massacre,' claiming corruption and financial fraud. Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation accused Kirk of spreading Russian propaganda. Kirk called for ending US aid to Ukraine, stated Crimea should be returned to Russia, and referred to the invasion as merely a 'border conflict.'
