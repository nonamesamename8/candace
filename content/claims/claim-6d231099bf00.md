### Analysis

MIXED: Hepatitis B CAN be sexually transmitted (TRUE), but the claim oversimplifies why newborns are vaccinated. Newborns are at high risk because: 1) Infection can occur during birth from infected mothers (90% chance of chronic infection if infected), 2) Can be transmitted through close contact with infected household members, 3) Babies infected before age 1 have 90% chance of chronic hepatitis B. The vaccine at birth is 90% effective at preventing mother-to-child transmission. Since 1991 universal vaccination, cases in children have dropped 99%.

**Confidence:** High
