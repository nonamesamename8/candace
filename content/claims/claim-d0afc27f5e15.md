## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

Initial reports from October 2025 indicate Bill Ackman donated $1 million to Defend NYC, a super PAC opposing Mamdani. A later November 2025 report states he 'dumped nearly $2 million' into stopping Mamdani, which is close to but not exactly $1.75 million. The claim's specific amount is not precisely matched across sources, making it mixed with the higher figure supported but not exact.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Check FEC or campaign finance records for NYC mayor race donations
