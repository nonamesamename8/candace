### Analysis

This is historically accurate. Candace Owens joined Turning Point USA in November 2017 as Director of Urban Engagement (later Communications Director) where Charlie Kirk was founder and executive director. They toured college campuses together and worked closely until her departure in May 2019. They maintained a friendship afterward, with Kirk attending her wedding. Both came to political prominence through their work at TPUSA. Sources: Wikipedia (Candace Owens, TPUSA), Britannica, BuzzFeed, CU Boulder announcements
