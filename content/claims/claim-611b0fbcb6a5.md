### Analysis

The claim about NY Post exclusives is partially true. They did publish photos of Ghislaine Maxwell at In-N-Out in 2019 (not an 'exclusive find' but a potentially staged photo). However, the major Epstein death photos were published by 60 Minutes/CBS, not NY Post as exclusive.

**Confidence:** Medium
