### Analysis

This claim is substantially true. According to a Fox News article citing a relative of Lance Twiggs, Twiggs was kicked out of his parents' home at age 18. The relative stated Twiggs was struggling with substance abuse issues, gaming addiction, and grappling with gender identity. The article specifically states 'Lance Twiggs... was kicked out of his parents home due to substance abuse and gaming addiction issues' and that 'The 22-year-old is in the process of transitioning from male to female. He was kicked out of his parents home at the age of 18.' However, the exact timing ('junior year of high school') cannot be precisely confirmed. Source: Fox News article 'Charlie Kirk alleged assassin's roommate was problematic before family kicked him out.'

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Family member interviews or records
