### Analysis

This is a personal anecdote from Candace Owens about her first planning session with Charlie Kirk at a Macaroni Grill restaurant in Chicago O'Hare airport. Such personal meetings are not typically documented in public records or verifiable through independent sources. The claim is specific and detailed (location, restaurant name), but without corroborating evidence from other witnesses or documentation, it cannot be independently verified. The claim appears in her tribute episode to Kirk.

**Confidence:** Low
