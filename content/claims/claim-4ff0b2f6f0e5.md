### Analysis

The claim states President al-Sisi can be ruled out from being in Provo in May 2023 because he was photographed in Egypt that week. While al-Sisi's general whereabouts may be trackable through official records, I could not locate specific photographic evidence of al-Sisi in Egypt during the specific week referenced in May 2023. The claim's specificity about 'multiple photographs throughout that week' cannot be independently verified without access to the specific photographs and dates referenced.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify photos from late May 2025 via news sources
