According to verified sources, TPUSA sold over 520,000 items of merchandise post-assassination (at roughly 5 per shirt), which equals approximately 8.2M max if all were shirts - far short of 0M. TPUSA's total organizational revenue for all of 2024 was 5M from all sources (99.2% charitable contributions), not merchandise alone. The claim significantly overstates merchandise revenue by conflating total organizational revenue with merchandise-only sales in a specific timeframe.
