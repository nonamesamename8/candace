### Analysis

The aircraft registration SU-BTU is confirmed to exist and is registered to the Egyptian Air Force as a Dassault Falcon 7X according to multiple aviation tracking databases including Plane Finder and PlaneLogger. The claim that 'Walid Mahmood' was aboard this plane cannot be independently verified through public sources, as passenger manifests for military aircraft are not publicly available. The tail number itself is accurately stated and the aircraft is confirmed to be Egyptian military.

**Confidence:** Medium
