### Analysis

Timeline is incorrect. George Zinn was taken into custody approximately 2 minutes after the 12:23 PM shooting, but FBI Director Kash Patel's public announcement that 'the subject' was in custody was made at 4:21 PM MT - approximately 4 hours after the shooting, not 30 minutes. Sources: NPR timeline, FBI Director tweets, multiple news outlets.
