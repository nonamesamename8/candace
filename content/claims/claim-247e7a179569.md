### Analysis

This claim references a military-contracted plane allegedly dipping to 300 feet over Provo airport at 9:16 AM on September 10, 2025 (the day Charlie Kirk was assassinated). Web searches found extensive discussion of planes near Provo that day, including a private Bombardier Challenger 300 (N888KG) that departed Provo Airport around 1:11 PM, and allegations by Candace Owens about Egyptian military planes. However, no credible sources confirm the specific details about a military-contracted plane from Biggs Army Airfield making a 300-foot dip at 9:16 AM. The '300' in some references appears to be the aircraft model (Bombardier Challenger 300), not altitude. This specific claim cannot be verified through available sources.
