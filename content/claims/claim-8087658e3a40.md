### Analysis

This claim is factually accurate. On April 13-14, 2018, the United States, France, and United Kingdom launched coordinated military strikes against Syrian government sites in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma on April 7, 2018. The strikes used both aircraft and ship-based missiles targeting chemical weapons facilities, including a research center in Damascus and storage facilities near Homs. The operation was announced by President Trump and confirmed by Defense Secretary James Mattis. Note: The claim mentions only US and France, but the UK was also involved in the strikes.
