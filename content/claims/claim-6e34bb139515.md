### Analysis

Official law enforcement sources (Governor Cox, FBI Director Kash Patel) stated Robinson 'acted alone' in the shooting. The previous verdict incorrectly conflated 'acting alone' with 'living alone.' Lance Twiggs was Robinson's roommate/partner who cooperated with FBI and provided evidence (notes, texts) but was NOT an accomplice in the shooting itself. Twiggs was never charged. The claim 'he acted alone and there was nobody else there' accurately reflects the official position on the shooting.
