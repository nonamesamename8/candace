### Analysis

This claim asserts that investigators did not recover a .30-06 bullet from Charlie Kirk's body. The speaker bases this on the absence of caliber information on the death certificate. However, without access to the official autopsy report, forensic findings, and death certificate, this cannot be independently verified. The claim involves non-public forensic documentation.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Ballistics report or death certificate
