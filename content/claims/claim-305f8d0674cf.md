**Status:** ✅ True

## Claim

> I spoke to that Turning Point individual... And the answer that I was given sounded more like what Andrew Kolvet said. 'You know, I was emotional. I knew that Charlie Kirk was dead. And my instinct was to make sure that I secured the footage so that Erika would not have to see it again. Like, he didn't want Erika to have to relive it.'

> I spoke to that Turning Point individual, as I told you, and he never once mentioned that police officers—I explicitly asked him, "Why did you take the SD cards out specifically of the camera behind Charlie Kirk) Kirk)'s head?" And the answer that I was given sounded more like what Andrew Kolvet said

### Analysis

This claim quotes what Candace Owens says a Turning Point USA individual told her about why SD cards were removed from cameras after Charlie Kirk's assassination. The claim is about what was said to Candace, not about the underlying facts. Andrew Kolvet, Charlie Kirk's longtime producer, publicly confirmed a similar account: a TPUSA staffer removed SD cards from cameras after the shooting to protect them from potential theft, with Kolvet stating the staffer said 'I know people can be evil' and didn't want footage grabbed by someone. Kolvet's public statement aligns with what Candace reports being told - that the motivation was emotional protection of footage/Erika, not police instruction. Tyler Bowyer separately claimed police requested the cards, which contradicts what Candace reports. The claim accurately represents what Candace says she was told.
