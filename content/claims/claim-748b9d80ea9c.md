### Analysis

The American Jewish Committee (AJC) did not call Charlie Kirk an 'anti-Semite and dangerous' in an official statement. After Kirk's assassination, the AJC released a statement saying they were 'horrified by the shooting' and condemned the 'disturbing act of political violence.' The AJC did criticize Kirk for spreading conspiracy theories about Jeffrey Epstein and Mossad, but did not use the specific language claimed. Other organizations like the ADL criticized Kirk's platform, and the Democratic Majority for Israel mentioned his 'antisemitic statements,' but the specific AJC statement described in the claim does not exist.
