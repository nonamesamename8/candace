### Analysis

Leo Frank was indeed found guilty by a jury on August 25, 1913, for the murder of Mary Phagan in Atlanta. This is well-documented historical fact confirmed by multiple sources including the Library of Congress, New Georgia Encyclopedia, and Famous Trials. The trial lasted 25 days, and the verdict was announced on August 25, 1913. Frank was later lynched on August 17, 1915, and posthumously pardoned in 1986 (not for innocence, but because the lynching deprived him of further appeals).

**Confidence:** High
