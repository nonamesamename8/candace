## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

The claim states April 2024, but verified sources show the UNC Chapel Hill Live Free Tour event with Candace Owens was on March 6, 2024, not April. TPUSA announced the Spring 2024 Live Free Tour featuring both Kirk and Owens, with plans to visit six campuses. The tour did occur in spring 2024, but the specific month is incorrect - it was March, not April. The claim is partially true but contains a factual error about the specific timing.

**Confidence:** Medium
