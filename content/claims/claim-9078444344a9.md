### Analysis

Tucker Carlson's claim that 'enough text messages exist' to verify Charlie Kirk's views on Netanyahu was validated when text messages were subsequently leaked and their authenticity confirmed. Andrew Kolvet, executive producer of Charlie Kirk's podcast and TPUSA spokesperson, confirmed the authenticity of leaked text messages showing Kirk's frustrations with Jewish donors and his private criticisms of Netanyahu. Multiple news outlets reported on these confirmed messages, including Kirk writing 'Just lost another huge Jewish donor.  million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.' At least one recipient (Josh Hammer) confirmed being on the text thread.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Release of text messages
