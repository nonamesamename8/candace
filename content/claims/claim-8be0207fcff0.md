### Analysis

Partially accurate. Candace Owens did meet Charlie Kirk in 2017 and was hired by him as director of urban engagement at Turning Point USA, announced on November 21, 2017 at the MAGA Rally in Rockford, Illinois. However, describing TPUSA as a 'very young organization' in 2017 is misleading - TPUSA was founded in 2012, making it 5 years old at the time they met, not 'very young.' By 2017, TPUSA had already established itself on hundreds of college campuses with significant funding and national recognition.
