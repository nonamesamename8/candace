### Analysis

ProPublica provides access to Turning Point USA's historical IRS Form 990 filings, which show a fiscal year ending June 30 (confirmed by posts found on X referencing filings like the one covering July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021). Per IRS rules, for a fiscal year ending June 30, the original Form 990 due date is November 15 of the same year, and filing for a 6-month extension moves the deadline to May 15 of the following year. The claim incorrectly states that the deadline with an extension is November 15, which is actually the original deadline without extension. No evidence was found of a change in fiscal year to make November 15 the extended date.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
