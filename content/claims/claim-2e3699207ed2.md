### Analysis

The claim incorrectly states November 15th is the deadline 'if you file for an extension.' This is backwards. November 15th is the ORIGINAL deadline for organizations with June 30 fiscal year end (Turning Point USA). If an extension is filed via Form 8868, the deadline extends to May 15 of the following year. The speaker confused the original deadline with the extended deadline. Sources: IRS.gov Form 990 filing guidelines, Turning Point USA fiscal year end (June 30) confirmed via ProPublica and audit documents.

**Confidence:** High
