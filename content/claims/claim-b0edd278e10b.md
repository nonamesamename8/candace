**Status:** ⚠️ Mixed

## Claim

> Charlie Kirk made sure the organization was audited by a third party every year. He personally reviewed, and he signed off on, every expense report and literally every single bill paid by the organization, down to a single United States dollar. We have never missed a 990 deadline

### Analysis

TPUSA is audited but ProPublica reports questions about audit independence. 990s are filed. Specific claim about Kirk personally reviewing every dollar cannot be verified from public sources.

**Confidence:** Medium
