**Status:** ❓ Unverifiable

## Claim

> the longtime CEO of that biopharmaceutical company Incyte was Hervé Hoppenot. And guess what? He's also French. He's not just French, but he is a French national. He seems to have just exited as the CEO, but he is still running the company under the role of advisor to the CEO. He is directly responsible for this construction at Bracebridge, and he was the one that finalized the deal. I find it very strange how he ran this company for more than a decade. And for some reason, just a few months before Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) death, he decides to switch roles
