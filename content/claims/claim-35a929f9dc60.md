### Analysis

Confirmed. This is a direct quote from a BBC News article about the Charlie Kirk shooting. The BBC interviewed Sherry Steele, who lives across the street from Tyler Robinson's residence. The article states: 'Sherri Steele, who lives across the street from the residence, came back from an evening walk to see a large police presence. In a video she showed the BBC, a loud voice, which she said belonged to authorities, can be heard shouting, "Freeze\!" and "Come out now\!"' While Candace Owens questions the credibility and timeline of this witness account, the claim itself is accurately reporting what the BBC published.
