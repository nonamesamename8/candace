### Analysis

This claim about Lance Twiggs' family thinking something is 'odd' cannot be independently verified. While multiple news sources confirm Lance Twiggs was Tyler Robinson's roommate and alleged partner, and that a family member spoke to media calling Lance the 'black sheep' of the family and expressing devastation over Kirk's murder, there are no public statements from Twiggs' family specifically stating they found the federal investigation 'odd' or expressing suspicions about how Lance was handled by authorities. The claim is based on what the speaker says the family told them privately.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Interviews or statements from family members
