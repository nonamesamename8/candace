### Analysis

This claim is false. Charlie Kirk was shot at approximately 12:23 p.m. local time (Mountain Time) on September 10, 2025. The plane's dip over Provo occurred at 9:16 a.m. Mountain Time. The time difference between the dip (9:16 a.m.) and the shooting (12:23 p.m.) is approximately 3 hours and 7 minutes, not 26 minutes. The claim appears to confuse the timeline of events.

**Confidence:** High
