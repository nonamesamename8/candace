### Analysis

This claim is based on what Candace Owens reports being told by an unnamed source about Tyler Robinson's reaction. The charging documents confirm Robinson did carve messages on casings and texted his roommate that the engravings were 'mostly a big meme' and joked about seeing 'notices bulge OwO' on Fox News. However, there is no public evidence about Robinson being specifically 'bewildered' by the idea he carved them. The source of this characterization (Candace's unnamed source) cannot be independently verified.

**Confidence:** Low
