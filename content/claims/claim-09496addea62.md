### Analysis

This is a speculative prediction, not a factual claim about something that has already occurred. The speaker states 'I will guarantee you' and 'I'm very close to figuring out' which are future-oriented assertions. Without the speaker providing evidence of which military unit allegedly wore maroon shirts, and without independent corroboration of military presence, this remains pure speculation. The claim structure itself makes it inherently unverifiable as presented.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verification through identification of the military unit
