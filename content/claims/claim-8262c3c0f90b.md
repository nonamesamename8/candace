### Analysis

This claim is verified as true. Charlie Kirk announced on November 21, 2017, that Candace Owens was hired as Turning Point USA's director of urban engagement. In October 2018, Owens launched the Blexit campaign at TPUSA's Young Black Leadership Summit. Kirk himself stated 'TPUSA was the incubator for some of the ideas that gave birth to the BLEXIT vision.' Multiple sources confirm Kirk's direct involvement and support during Blexit's founding period in 2018, substantiating Owens' statement that Charlie was 'right by my side when I started Blexit.'
