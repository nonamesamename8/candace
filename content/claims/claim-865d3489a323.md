### Analysis

Unverifiable. While it is confirmed that Egyptian Air Force aircraft SU-BTT (Dassault Falcon 7X) arrived at Provo on September 4, 2025 for scheduled maintenance at Duncan Aviation and departed on September 10, 2025, the specific claim about it only visiting the U.S. twice in the past year, both times in weeks leading up to Kirk's assassination, cannot be verified from available sources. Flight tracking data for SU-BTT exists but comprehensive historical records for all U.S. visits are not publicly available to confirm or refute this specific claim.

**Confidence:** Low
