### Analysis

This is hearsay testimony about private off-record conversations. The speaker states three people told her this information, with two claiming written communications from Charlie Kirk. Charlie Kirk was assassinated on September 10, 2025, which makes the temporal claim plausible ('the very day before'). However, without the individuals coming forward publicly or providing the alleged written communications, this remains unverifiable hearsay that cannot be independently confirmed.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Testimony from the three individuals coming forward
