### Analysis

Candace Owens claims Andrew Kolvet said this to her in a phone call 72 hours after Kirk's assassination. This is a claimed quote from a private conversation between two people. While Owens has publicly stated this on her podcast (confirmed via web search), there is no way to independently verify whether Kolvet actually said these words, as it was a private phone call with no recording or witnesses. Kolvet has not publicly confirmed or denied this quote.
