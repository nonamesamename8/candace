### Analysis

Verified: Sigmund Freud joined the Vienna Lodge of B'nai B'rith in September 1897. He delivered 27 lectures to B'nai B'rith between 1897 and 1917. This membership was significant because the B'nai B'rith provided Freud his first audience when European academia rejected his early psychoanalytic work. Multiple scholarly sources confirm this membership including the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association and Jewish Telegraphic Agency archives.
