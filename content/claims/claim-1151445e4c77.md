### Analysis

Cannot independently verify through public sources. The claim appears in search results only as part of Candace Owens' own reporting about her investigation. Third-party sources reference her claims about 'Walid Mahmood' as a passenger name, but no independent verification from aviation authorities, law enforcement, or official government sources could be found. The claim involves private travel manifests and potentially classified information that would not be publicly available. This is investigative journalism that cannot be fact-checked through open sources.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Check passenger records or manifests for name on flight
