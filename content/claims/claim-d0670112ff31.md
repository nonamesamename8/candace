### Analysis

Multiple LA Times articles from 1995 confirm the conviction in May, molestation of an 8-year-old girl, attempts to lure over a dozen children using a lost cat story, and an 8-year maximum sentence imposed by Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Richard M. Aronson on Thomas Michael Cimino, aged 31, from San Juan Capistrano. The claim accurately describes these events but incorrectly spells the last name as 'Camino' instead of 'Cimino'.

**Confidence:** High
