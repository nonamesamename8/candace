### Analysis

Conflicting statements exist from primary sources involved in the event: Frank Turek claimed in an interview on the Megyn Kelly Show that Charlie Kirk's team used drones to monitor the crowd and sent video footage, while Brian Harpole, head of security, stated in a podcast that drones were not allowed and not used. No independent reliable sources, such as news articles, official TPUSA statements, police reports from the assassination investigation, or FAA drone flight records, were found to confirm or refute the claim. Verification would require access to FAA flight logs for September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University or official documents from the law enforcement investigation into the event.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Megyn Kelly interview with Frank Turek
