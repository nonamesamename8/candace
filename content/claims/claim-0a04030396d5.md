### Analysis

Unverifiable: This claim is about Charlie Kirk's subjective emotional state and internal thought processes ('authentically angry', 'recognizing how much control was around him'). No objective evidence can verify someone's internal emotional authenticity or their specific realizations. This is Candace Owens' interpretation of Kirk's state of mind, not a verifiable factual claim. Tucker Carlson did state that Kirk 'was appalled by what was happening in Gaza' and 'did not like Bibi Netanyahu', which suggests some level of questioning, but the specific characterization of authentic anger and recognition of control remains a subjective interpretation.

**Confidence:** Low

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Evidence from Charlie Kirk's communications or videos showing this shift.
