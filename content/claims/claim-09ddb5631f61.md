### Analysis

Partially true but contains a factual error. Charlie Kirk DID envision Turning Point USA becoming the biggest conservative student organization globally and it achieved that goal. Multiple sources confirm TPUSA grew to be present on 3,000+ campuses and became 'the largest and fastest-growing conservative youth activist organization in America.' The claim about Kirk discussing taking control of the RNC at age 23 is supported by Candace Owens' firsthand testimony of their planning session at Chicago O'Hare Macaroni Grill. However, the claim implies this happened when Kirk was 23, but Kirk founded TPUSA in 2012 at age 18 (born Oct 14, 1993), so he would have been around age 19-20 during early planning sessions with Owens, not 23. The transcript shows Owens saying 'he's 23 years old' as clarification during her retelling, but the planning session she describes appears to be from earlier in TPUSA's history.

**Confidence:** Medium
