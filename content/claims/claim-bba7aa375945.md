### Analysis

Verified as TRUE. Amazon confirmed both parts of the claim. An Amazon spokesperson stated: 'The title in question is no longer available for sale. Due to a technical issue, the date of publication that had been displayed for this title, while it was briefly listed, was incorrect, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused. The title was published late in the afternoon on September 10th.' This confirms: (1) Amazon blamed the incorrect publication date on technical issues, and (2) Amazon removed the book. The book was about Charlie Kirk's assassination and appeared with a Sept 9 date despite being published Sept 10. Multiple fact-checkers verified Amazon's response and book removal.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify Amazon's statement and book publication details
