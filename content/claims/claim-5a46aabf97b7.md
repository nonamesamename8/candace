### Analysis

Multiple sources report Laura Loomer is prohibited from gun ownership under 18 USC 922(g)(4) due to involuntary psychiatric holds under Florida's Baker Act, with FBI confirmation of the prohibition. However, these reports largely stem from claims by Milo Yiannopoulos in 2024 who has personal conflicts with Loomer, and lack mainstream media or official documentation. Loomer herself has not publicly confirmed the hospitalization details. The gun prohibition appears factual but the specific circumstances ('psychotic events requiring hospitalization') lack independent verification.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify through public records or legal documents regarding Loomer's firearm ownership restrictions
