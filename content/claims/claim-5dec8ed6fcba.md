### Analysis

Candace Owens released screenshots of text messages allegedly from Charlie Kirk dated April 6, 2018, in which he states 'Since the beginning of TPUSA I knew in my gut that I might get wiped out at any time. I cannot explain it, but I dream about it all the time.' A TPUSA spokesperson stated the screenshots 'appear authentic' though they claim context is being misrepresented. The messages include Kirk comparing himself to Moses and saying he might not see the revolution through. While the authenticity of the text messages has been acknowledged by TPUSA, the subjective nature of Kirk's feelings and dreams cannot be independently verified beyond the existence of these messages. The claim accurately represents what Kirk wrote in the texts.

**Confidence:** Medium
