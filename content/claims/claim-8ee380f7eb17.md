### Analysis

Verified as substantially true based on context. The speaker (likely a Turning Point co-founder) states this was Charlie Kirk's personal rule/philosophy about Fox News appearances - never declining invitations even for early morning shows, doing multiple hits per day. While we cannot verify the exact '4 a.m.' detail or 'four hits a day' frequency, Kirk was documented as a frequent Fox News guest, with his last appearance on Sept 9, 2025. This appears to be a first-hand account of Kirk's media strategy.

**Confidence:** Medium
