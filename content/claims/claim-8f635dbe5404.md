### Analysis

Fox did not explicitly state Ukraine war coverage as reason for firing. Multiple sources indicate Ukraine coverage was one of several factors, but Dominion lawsuit, Jan 6 conspiracies, workplace issues, and criticism of management also contributed. Murdoch was displeased with Ukraine stance but no single cause confirmed.

**Confidence:** Medium
