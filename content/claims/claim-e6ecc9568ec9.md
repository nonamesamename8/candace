### Analysis

No reliable sources, including news articles, official flight records, or government statements, were found mentioning a yellow plane with tail number SUBTT making a one-hour stopover in Minot, North Dakota, on September 4th (assuming 2025 based on context) before proceeding to Provo. Searches across web results and X posts yielded information on unrelated incidents, such as a July 2025 near-miss at Minot Airport and Egyptian jets in Provo on September 10th, but nothing matching the specific claim. Verification would require access to FAA flight logs, FlightAware or ADS-B tracking data, or official records from Minot International Airport/Minot AFB via FOIA request, which are not publicly available in the searched sources.

**Confidence:** High

**Source:** [N/A](N/A)

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify via flight tracking data for tail number SUBTT on September 4th
