### Analysis

Reliable fact-check sources confirm a real photo exists of Tyler Robinson wearing a plain shirt (described in multiple reports as maroon) and shorts, taken in the context of his arrival on campus the morning of the incident. Posts found on X align with the 8:07 a.m. timeline and outfit description, supporting the official narrative. However, confidence is medium due to some online debate questioning if it's him, though primary news sources treat the photo as authentic and of Robinson.

**Confidence:** Medium
