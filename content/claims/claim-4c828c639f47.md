### Analysis

FALSE: According to a recent Treasury Department letter (December 2025), all four Turning Point entities (Turning Point USA Inc., Turning Point Action Inc., Turning Point Endowment Inc., and America's Turning Point Inc.) 'submitted on time' all their 990 forms to the IRS. The Treasury confirmed none are under IRS investigation. While the claim references concerns raised by Wolves and Finance about missing 2024 fiscal year forms on ProPublica, the official Treasury Department correspondence directly contradicts the assertion that deadlines were missed.

**Confidence:** High
