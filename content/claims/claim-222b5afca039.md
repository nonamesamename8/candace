## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

This claim is a direct quote from a witness (aunt of Shaner Broderick) captured on video, so the quote itself is verifiable. Multiple sources including Gateway Pundit and other outlets confirm the video exists and contains this statement. However, the factual assertion within the quote (that there was an accomplice woman who gave the shooter items) remains unverified. The FBI is investigating potential accomplices, but neither FBI nor Utah law enforcement has confirmed seeing another person with Robinson before or after the shooting. The claim accurately represents what was said on video, but the underlying allegation is unconfirmed speculation.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Release of full doorbell footage
