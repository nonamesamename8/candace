### Analysis

Searches of Caldera Engineering's website (calderaengineering.com) and related pages do not reveal any map showing engineering projects by country, nor any mention of work in Israel or dots representing projects there. Multiple site pages, including About Us, History, and Engineering sections, were reviewed with no reference to Israel or such a map. Additional searches for variations like project maps or international collaborations also yielded no supporting evidence, contradicting the claim.

**Confidence:** High
