### Analysis

Confirmed per Tucker Carlson investigation: Crooks was described as a 'radical Trump supporter' ages 15-17 (2019), praising Trump as 'literal definition of Patriotism.' During COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, he underwent political transformation, criticizing Trump's pandemic response and calling Trump supporters 'brainwashed' and a 'cult.' However, note this is based on investigative journalism, not official FBI statements.
