### Analysis

This conspiracy theory claim about different people on an Egyptian military plane was debunked. Candace Owens promoted this theory but made a critical time zone error - she misread UTC time as local Utah time, claiming the plane departed after Kirk's assassination when it actually left at 7:08 AM local time, hours before the shooting. Law enforcement confirmed Tyler Robinson as the sole suspect with no evidence of foreign involvement. The theory lacked independent verification of flight logs or passenger manifests. Sources: Yahoo News, Factually.co, AOL, The Daily Guardian.

**Confidence:** High

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verify passenger manifests or flight data from Provo, Utah on date of Charlie Kirk's alleged assassination
