## Verification

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

Cannot verify the specific claim about who initially shared viral videos. Search results show videos spread widely across platforms (X, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube) and were viewed by millions, but no sources identify the original sharers or document their ties to government or TPUSA. The PBS and NPR coverage discusses how the videos spread but not who first shared them.

**Confidence:** Low
