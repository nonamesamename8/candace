### Analysis

While Erika Kirk (Charlie Kirk's widow) stated in a New York Times interview that Charlie was not wearing a bulletproof vest at the time of the shooting, this contradicts claims from Megyn Kelly and widespread online speculation based on video evidence showing bulging under his shirt. The claim cannot be definitively verified as there is no official forensic or law enforcement confirmation either way, and conflicting accounts exist from people close to the situation.
