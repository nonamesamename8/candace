### Analysis

Multiple news sources, including The New York Times, Axios, and The Guardian, report on Candace Owens promoting conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination, including claims of screenshots from group chats, but none provide independent verification of the screenshot's authenticity. Posts on X discuss Owens sharing the screenshot, but X content is not conclusive evidence. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., the assassination date around September 10, 2025, based on timeline in sources) with unverified ones (the chat's existence and content). Verification would require statements from chat participants (e.g., Rob McCoy or others named), digital forensic analysis of the screenshot, or official investigation records from law enforcement, such as FBI documents obtained via FOIA.

**Confidence:** Medium
