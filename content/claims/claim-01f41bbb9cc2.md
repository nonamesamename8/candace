### Analysis

Rob McCoy DID make this claim. Direct quote: 'The minute Charlie was shot, he called me, he says, Dad, Charlie's been shot in the neck.' The claim is about what Rob McCoy CLAIMED, not whether his claim was accurate. Rob McCoy absolutely made this statement publicly. Whether Mikey actually called his dad first (vs. Erika Kirk, who also claims Mikey called her) is a separate question. The claim as stated is TRUE.

**Confidence:** High
