### Analysis

This claim refers to Freud's abandonment of his seduction theory in the late 1890s. Initially, Freud believed his patients' reports of childhood sexual abuse were literal, but under professional pressure, he reframed these accounts as fantasies, introducing concepts like the Oedipus complex. Historian Florence Rush coined the term 'Freudian Coverup' in 1971, and Jeffrey Masson's 1984 book 'The Assault on Truth' documented how Freud suppressed evidence of real sexual abuse. Multiple sources confirm that Freud transformed victims' abuse accounts into 'fantasies,' which scholars describe as a gaslighting framework. Sources: Wikipedia articles on Freud's seduction theory and Freudian Coverup, Medium article on psychotherapy history, University of Texas event materials.

**Confidence:** High
