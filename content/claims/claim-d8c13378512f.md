### Analysis

Death certificates typically document cause and manner of death but do not routinely include specific forensic details like bullet caliber. According to CDC and NCBI medical examiner guidelines (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526015/), while autopsy reports contain detailed ballistic information, the death certificate itself follows WHO-recommended formats that focus on underlying cause of death rather than forensic evidence details. The claim's assumption that bullet caliber would be 'reflected onto' a death certificate is inconsistent with standard death certification practices.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Public death certificate
