### Analysis

Eric Bolling did appear on PBD Podcast Episode 650 and made statements about Candace Owens' relationship with Charlie Kirk. Bolling stated that Kirk and Owens 'had a break-up' and that there 'hasn't been a communication pipeline between the two for many years.' However, the characterization of this as 'lying through his teeth' is subjective. Some dispute Bolling's timeline claims, noting Owens toured for TPUSA in 2024. The claim contains factual elements (Bolling appeared on PBD and made statements about their relationship) but the 'lying' characterization represents Owens' interpretation rather than an objective fact. Sources: Yahoo News, Independent Sentinel articles on the podcast appearance.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Review the PBD podcast episode for statements
