### Analysis

Tucker Carlson did speak at AmFest in both 2023 and 2024, which is confirmed. However, the claim that 'they said that can't happen again' requires more context. There was donor pressure - Robert Shillman, a tech billionaire, cancelled a  million pledge over Carlson's participation at a Turning Point event, and there were concerns raised about Carlson's inclusion. But evidence doesn't show an outright ban was imposed. The claim oversimplifies a more complex situation involving donor pressure rather than a categorical prohibition. Sources: Tucker Carlson website, Deseret News, The New Republic, New York Times reporting.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Verifiable via event attendance records and communications
