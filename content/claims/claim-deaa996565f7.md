### Analysis

Mixed accuracy: The ADL was indeed founded in 1913 by B'nai B'rith in response to the Leo Frank case. However, the characterization is misleading. Leo Frank was convicted of murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan, but historians today generally consider him to have been wrongly convicted due to antisemitism. The claim he was a 'pedophile' is inflammatory and not supported by historical evidence - he was accused of murder, not sexual assault of a child. The ADL was founded to combat antisemitism after what Jewish leaders viewed as a wrongful prosecution driven by prejudice. Frank was later pardoned in 1986.

**Confidence:** Medium
