> But I do know that when I got in touch with this individual and he sent me the footage, my eye immediately gravitated towards another person who happened to be wearing a rune, who is also alone at the event, who I thought was kind of strange, did not duck when everybody else ducked after the shot went off

> **Note:** Claim verification is performed using AI-powered web search. Results should be independently verified for critical decisions.

### Analysis

No independent verification available. Claim is based on private video footage allegedly submitted to FBI and shared with Owens. The specific behavior described (not ducking) is not corroborated in any mainstream media coverage of the Charlie Kirk shooting. Jacob Kasparian is not mentioned in any public sources related to the incident. This remains a private allegation without public evidence.

**Confidence:** High
