### Analysis

Owens' claim about being told she couldn't speak at AmFest due to donor threats is unverifiable. Public reporting confirms Owens was excluded from Kirk memorial events and there was significant controversy between Owens and TPUSA leadership over her allegations about pro-Israel donor pressure on Kirk. However, no independent documentation confirms the specific claim about AmFest speaking ban or explicit donor threats. TPUSA disputes Owens' broader allegations.

**Confidence:** Medium

## Follow-up

**Expected:** Investigate internal communications or statements from Turning Point USA regarding AmFest speakers.
