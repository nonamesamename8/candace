### Analysis

The claim that Rob McCoy was added to TPUSA Wikipedia page 'for the first time' on September 11, 2025 (less than 36 hours after Charlie Kirk's death) cannot be fully verified without access to Wikipedia edit history. However, multiple sources confirm Rob McCoy is legitimately co-founder of TPUSA Faith (founded 2021 with Charlie Kirk after Liberty University ended Kirk's Falkirk Center contract). McCoy is listed as co-founder on official TPUSA Faith website and in Wikipedia's current version. The timing of when this information was first added to Wikipedia cannot be verified through web search. The underlying fact - that McCoy co-founded TPUSA Faith - is TRUE, but the claim about when it was added to Wikipedia is UNVERIFIABLE.
