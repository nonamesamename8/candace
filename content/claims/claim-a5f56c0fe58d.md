### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets, official government statements, or Macron's public calendar documents, were found confirming a phone call between Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron on September 10, 2025, at 6:45 p.m. French time (10:45 a.m. Utah time). Posts on X mention this detail and reference public records, but X posts are not conclusive evidence and may contain unverified claims. Additionally, the exact time of Charlie Kirk's assassination is not detailed in reliable sources, making the '1.5 hours before' aspect impossible to confirm. Verification would require access to Emmanuel Macron's official public calendar for September 10, 2025, or FOIA-requested records from French or U.S. government sources documenting the call, as well as precise timestamps from police reports or news archives on the assassination timing.
