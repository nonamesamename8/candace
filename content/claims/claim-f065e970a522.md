### Analysis

This is a negative claim asserting the absence of video evidence showing Tyler Robinson firing a weapon or taking aim at Charlie Kirk. While this may be factually accurate as a statement about what video evidence exists publicly, it cannot be definitively verified because: (1) law enforcement may have video evidence not released publicly, (2) absence of public video doesn't mean it doesn't exist, and (3) this relates to an ongoing investigation where complete evidence is not publicly available.

**Confidence:** Medium
