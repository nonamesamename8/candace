### Analysis

Official reports and court documents describe the gun as being found in woods/bushes near UVU campus, wrapped in a towel. Text messages from Robinson mention leaving the rifle 'in a bush.' While the general area matches (gun found in residential area near campus), there is no mention of a 'chicken coop' in any official reports, only in this local source's account. The gun was found in wooded area, not specifically at a chicken coop.

**Confidence:** Medium
