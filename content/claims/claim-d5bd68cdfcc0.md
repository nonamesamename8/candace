### Analysis

The claim states staff decreased by 33%, but Form 990 data shows only a 4% reduction (709 to 681 employees, or 28 employees) from 2022 to 2023. However, the salary portion is accurate: compensation increased from 7 million (2022) to 0 million (2023) despite the staff reduction. The 33% figure appears to be incorrect or refers to a different metric not evident in the public 990 forms. Sources: ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer, Paddock Post analysis of TPUSA Form 990s.

**Confidence:** High
