**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. Happy Monday. Is everybody okay? I just want to check in to see if everybody's feeling okay because there are a lot of people online who are coming undone. What is it about the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk investigation? What is it about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk's assassination that is causing so much panic? They're saying I faked the text messages again, the ones I showed regarding Ben Shapiro. They got AI analysis. These are fake. They're sending experts—quote-unquote experts—out to diagnose me at my show, and they've decided we're a cult. Okay. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=41" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-00-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Over the weekend, Grok—literally the AI robot—crashed out. He crashed out. He couldn't keep up with the lies about me, and so then he started the robot on top of a trend that Candace (Candace Owens) Owens has accused Marcus Hale of murdering Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk this past October. I don't know what's going on. I'm just going to say... That is kind of weird how the only people that seem to believe the fed story are Zionists, and they demand that we accept the fed story. And their panic is making me think that we're getting closer to something, and that something is pretty big, and it's going to implicate a lot of people. I don't know. ^t-00-00-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=81" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-01-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Today, I'm going to tell you guys about a particular person who is connected to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk and January 6th. So welcome back to Candace (Candace Owens). Okay, so something that I want to say right at the top here before we get further into the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk story and speaking about January 6th and how somehow that's connected. There's something I learned that's bothering me. I'm just going to put it out there. See if it bothers you as well. ^t-00-01-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=121" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-02-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But I learned via tips that the feds immediately seized the footage at Timpanogos Hospital. Okay, Timpanogos Hospital. Remember, this is the hospital that it was quite strange that they moved to take Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to because it was further and also less equipped than UV Hospital. It was like UV was a trauma one, and Timpanogos was trauma three, and a bunch of people said, "Very strange that they took him here." And then it got strange because we started hearing from other people that he was definitely at UV Hospital. It was very weird. Anyways, I'd like to add to that by saying... ^t-00-02-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=159" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-02-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot—for whatever reason, you know—Kash Patel injects himself into it. The feds seized all of the footage at the hospital that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was brought to at Timpanogos. That doesn't make sense to me. Nothing makes sense to me in this whole story. So this is just kind of the icing on, you know, on the top here—not even the icing on the top. But why would they move to seize that footage? How is that going to help their investigation? What's happening inside of Timpanogos? How is that going to help their investigation? Their immediate boots-on-the-ground investigation into who shot Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk. They're trying. They're on a manhunt. Why are they going, "Okay, let's at first grab the footage at Timpanogos"? Does that make sense? Were you worried? ^t-00-02-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=200" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-03-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Did the nurse call 911 and say, "Oh, a guy just ran in here with a gun," and you need to seize the footage because that's going to help you track them down? If that didn't happen, why are you seizing that footage? I don't know. With everything that is going on, and I would say almost the lack of information that we have at Timpanogos—on a single person who captured them pulling up—nothing, despite the fact that there were news cameras outside waiting, oddly from like a New York news channel. We have not seen anything that we can build in confidently on our timeline that would let us know what time in particular Charlie (Charlie Kirk) arrived at the hospital. ^t-00-03-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=239" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-03-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I feel like something's amiss if the feds move to grab the footage inside of the hospital immediately and outside of the hospital immediately. So just putting it out there. If you maybe were somebody who has footage and saw that black SUV pull up at the hospital, please get that to us at MoreTips@CandaceOwens.com because it's starting to bother me. Something there is starting to feel amiss. Everything's amiss. Anyway, there also happens to be another interesting constellation that's building here because, as I said at the top, there is something about this investigation into Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk ^t-00-03-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=277" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-04-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** and who assassinated him that is causing extremely powerful people to panic—a network of powerful people. And by powerful people, I mean the feds, okay? I don't know about you, but I'm starting to wonder if every major publicly traumatizing event they have actually just been organized by the feds. And rather than blaming themselves, the strategy that they always employ is to get out a narrative—a sloppy narrative—like we saw this time with the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk assassination. That is one thing that I will say is so amazing. The only thing that has been amazing about the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk assassination is that it has brought the left and the right together. ^t-00-04-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=321" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-05-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And what I mean by that is typically we're ready to take the fed slop. This time it was the messages, obviously. And they're like, "Oh, my dad's MAGA." "He just—he was MAGAing too hard." And the left was supposed to go, "See, it's his dad's fault." "MAGA's bad." And then the right was supposed to go, "Look, trans person bad." This time though, we all went, "This is too evil." It feels orchestrated. And do you guys always do this? Like, is this what you guys do? That definitely—now that I'm reflecting, and I am including myself in this—that was kind of my old vibe: left or right. That was definitely the vibe of January 6th, right? We all took the bait. Just own it, okay? If you're a lefty, own it. You were like, "MAGA is bad." ^t-00-05-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=366" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-06-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** If you're on the right, own it. We were like, "The left is bad." "They're overthrowing an election." We did it. On January 6th, 2021, I can tell you where I was. I was nine months pregnant—my first child—and I was super MAGA at this time. I would have definitively gone to this stop-the-steal rally, but I was just too pregnant to go. And I was living in D.C., so it was just down the street from me. And I reflect on that, and I think, "Wow, that saved me," because I could have been swept up in what happened on January 6th. I could have been there. We all know how the story goes. Trump (Donald Trump) hosts this speech. He has this rally. And then afterward, people—quote-unquote—storm the Capitol, break through the barriers. And there's an insurrection, and CNN is showing these clips in the footage. ^t-00-06-06

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=410" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-06-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And it's funny for me, especially because I was right up the road, and as a resident of D.C.—literally living there. And I was thinking how strange it was. I'm sitting on the couch with my husband. We start getting all these phone calls—like from my sisters and family members—asking if we're okay. And we didn't have the news on, and we're like, "Yeah, we're okay." "So strange that you're calling." "We don't even hear any noise." And it was actually the first time that there was peace in D.C., meaning it was the summer of BLM riots. So it was strange that we never got called when people's cars were getting smashed and things were being burned to the ground. But suddenly we were getting phone calls because the media was there, you know, right there. "The MAGA has gone too far," and they were showing all this footage, and it was out of place, right? ^t-00-06-50

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=451" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-07-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, I knew instantly as a D.C. resident that the feds were involved because of the pipe bombs. That was it. I knew they were involved when I heard that pipe bombs were mysteriously dropped off the night before at the DNC headquarters, RNC headquarters. And we just don't know who did that because I live there, and there—I mean, it's the capital. So every square inch, there's a camera. You just can't do that. You can't just get away from being a couple of blocks away from the White House and dropping off pipe bombs, right? ^t-00-07-31

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=485" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-08-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Anyways, this weekend—after five long years—finally the person, and I'll say allegedly because I guess we're going to have to wait for the feds to dispute this, but the person responsible for dropping off those pipe bombs was revealed to be a fed—more specifically, a 31-year-old woman and a United States Capitol Police officer named Shawna Rae Kirkhoff, right? A man named—a reporter named Steve Baker—who just deserves all of the credit on this amazing discovery. And I'm going to let you listen to Glenn Beck (Glenn Beck), who is interviewing Steve Baker, to tell you about how he came across this footage and how that went down. ^t-00-08-05

And when I pulled this thread, I was so shocked by what I saw. I immediately took it to a source in one of the most important, highest-level investigative federal agencies in the country. I immediately took it to our sources there, and I said, "You have to see this." ^t-00-08-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=559" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-09-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** After they looked at it for about two hours, the response that I got back was, "Holy F." And then the follow-up response was, "He's one of us." And when you find out the position—I mean, this is going to lead. It's not just this one person. This now will implicate so many people at the highest levels that had to have known because of what happened after January 6th. ^t-00-09-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=609" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-10-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I'm feeling this way about the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk investigation. A lot of people are going to get swept up in this investigation—perhaps the same people that are going to get swept up in the January 6th. And it's not going to be this left-or-right story, right? Now, much more is going to come out. I'm not here to cover all of January 6th and what they have been unpacking. More will come out in the coming days. What we do know is, like I said, this was a five-year investigation. It involved forensic analysis. A CIA spokeswoman, Liz Lyon, stated that Shawna Rae Kirkhoff, the alleged person who dropped off these pipe bombs, worked in Capitol Police Campus Security. She lives in Alexandria, Virginia. She is apparently now under the watch of law enforcement officers because the Blaze News editor-in-chief ^t-00-10-09

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=653" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-10-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** decided to pull up to her house to just kind of see if any action was happening at her home. And then he instantly got stopped by local police before they allowed him to leave. Now, surprise, surprise. I think it's always the feds. And we might be being ruled by criminals. Like, I don't know—Jeffrey Epstein, who? Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? We're still talking about Jeffrey Epstein, Trumpy. Now, if we are allowed to follow this idea that the feds are behind major politically divisive events, then we have to ask ourselves who exactly was behind organizing the Stop the Steal rally event itself. ^t-00-10-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=692" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-11-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And interestingly enough, on the quote-unquote Republican side, Christian Zionist pastors were heavily involved in not just influencing the public, right? Understanding right away—telling the public, the Republicans, that we had to fight for justice. They went out immediately following the election results. One person was Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau), okay? I want you to remember this guy's name: Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau). Immediately—just three days after the election of 2020, on November 6th—he publishes this onto his Facebook page, okay? It says, "We're going to expose the fraud and stop this steal." "The Lord our God is with us, and we were built for this battle." "Be strong and courageous." ^t-00-11-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=737" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-12-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's three days after—saying "stop the steal, be strong, be courageous." And Lance (Lance Wallnau), who is a charismatic preacher, wasn't the only charismatic preacher or pastor that instantly threw their weight behind quote-unquote stopping the steal. Actually, four out of the six protest permits that were issued on January 6th were issued to independent, charismatic Christian groups, okay? Fifteen of these pastors and leaders surrounded Trump (Donald Trump) at the White House leading up to the January 6th Stop the Steal rally, telling him that the war was now spiritual. So they're in his ear: "This is spiritual. This is what you have to do, Mr. President," okay? ^t-00-12-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=781" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-13-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** There's an article about that. "Apostolic Reformation drove the January 6th riots." "So why was it overlooked by the House Select Committee?" this person asks, okay? NAR. I brought this up to you before. Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau) is in this article. So is Sean Feucht (Sean Feucht). Now you're thinking these names might sound familiar. Certainly Sean Feucht (Sean Feucht). I brought him up to you regarding TPUSA Faith, who started to lead these events that they were having. So who is Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau)? Well, he is one of these NAR preachers—like I said—who came up with their Seven Mountain Mandate, okay? Charlie (Charlie Kirk) began to become very interested in the Seven Mountain Mandate. ^t-00-13-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=825" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-13-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I would say like he became mesmerized by the Seven Mountain Mandate. He became friends with Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau). I'm going to let you listen to Lance (Lance Wallnau) himself describe this Seven Mountain Mandate in his own words. ^t-00-13-45

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=839" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-13-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** *(Clip from Lance Wallnau)* Hi, I'm Lance Wallnau. I want to talk to you for a moment about this concept called the 7M Mandate. In reality, it started with a conversation I had in the year 2000. I had been talking to Loren Cunningham, who's the founder of Youth With A Mission, and Loren was sharing with me about a conversation he had had with Bill Bright. The two of them were visited actually by the Lord within the same 24 hours, and God spoke to them and said they had a message to give the other man. And the message was that there are seven molders of culture or seven world kingdoms, and that he who could take those kingdoms could take the harvest of nations. Now this illustration is the way I see it. I look at it this way. ^t-00-13-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=881" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-14-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** I see those seven molders of culture as being the religion mountain as a metaphor for something you've got to take or climb. Then we have education; we could say family. These are in no particular order of importance. They all represent the forces that shape societies and nations: government, media, arts— which is the entertainment mountain—and business, which is where we have the economics mountain happening also. Now these seven fields of influence are very powerful—so powerful, in fact, that he who occupies the top of those mountains can literally shape the agenda that forms nations. ^t-00-14-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=924" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-15-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** The foundation of the prosperity of nations is going to have to be the teaching of Jesus. The good news is you can do that covertly, or you can do that overtly. You can be—like I always say—you could actually be following that thing from Jehovah-Rophi, Jehovah-Nissi, Jehovah-Tsidkenu, or Jehovah-Sneaky, because God has a way of getting into positions, companies, businesses, nations, and communities before the devil even knows what got in there, because the gospel is bigger than just the church mountain. It's the gospel that covers the whole earth. ^t-00-15-24

They have the Seven Mountain Mandate, and when he is speaking about covertly, he means that, okay? This is a philosophy of infiltration. He says, "But before people even know—boom." He describes it as a devil, but before people know, boom—everyone around them is actually working for a higher purpose. Man, I got to say—kind of sort of reminds me of what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), right? This is kind of where this is going. Turning Point Faith—everywhere that I'm investigating, Turning Point Faith keeps coming up. ^t-00-16-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=999" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-16-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** These characters keep coming up, and there's a pattern that I'm noticing that a lot of these mainstream pastors and preachers actually come from high-ranking military families. High-ranking military families have been around for a long time: ties to the Navy, ties to the Air Force. Frank Turek (Frank Turek), Air Force. Rob McCoy—we discussed about his background, his naval background, psychological operations. They're literally named like a fleet of ships after his father—like there was like the McCoy naval something. Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau)—he's no different. He graduated from a military academy. His father, Carl Wallnau, was a major in the United States Air Force. Wallnau served under General Patton. ^t-00-16-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=1043" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-17-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** After the war, he then continued his adventures as a field engineer for Standard Oil. Okay, building high-pressure liquid propane installations throughout political revolutions in the world. So he would go and do that in Haiti, in Cuba, Dominican Republic—places that I would argue that we caused a lot of drama in—just saying. So Lance (Lance Wallnau) fits the pattern well. And before I tell you how he is very connected to Turning Point USA Faith, I do want to also be clear that Frank Turek (Frank Turek) stands out because he flat-out acknowledged on one of his podcasts that NAR was a cult—actually darker than a cult. Take a listen to what Frank Turek (Frank Turek) said about NAR. ^t-00-17-23

I'm sorry, the New Apostolic Reformation. That's Bill Johnson out there in California—in Northern California. We'll talk about him in a minute. But Word of Faith movement—they don't necessarily add, subtract, multiply, or divide—but their hermeneutic, the way they interpret the Scriptures, is aberrant. And they interpret the Scriptures in such a way that their practice follows this aberrant theology that they have, and they wind up doing things that are more New Age-y or more even occult-like than they are Christian. The occult—and that is correct. ^t-00-18-06

I had a phone call with someone, by the way, who's extremely close to this current administration, and they said—completely offhandedly—we were not even really discussing Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—but then they said, "You know something that's really weird? I was at Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) memorial." She said, "When did Turning Point become so faith-focused?" She's like, "I remember obviously Charlie (Charlie Kirk) always spoke about his evangelical faith." She's like, "But when you guys were running around and starting all these Turning Point chapters, it was all about free markets and capitalism." And she was like, "And I was at the rally, and it was suddenly faith, faith, faith, faith—pastor, pastor, pastor." ^t-00-18-50

"That is true that it just kind of started." And then it was almost the biggest thing about Turning Point. It's really interesting to consider that Turning Point suddenly got super-duper faithful with what I would say is an interesting cast of characters—the wrong characters. Rob McCoy leading that frontier, as we know. What people don't know publicly is that Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau) was working with him. He was intimately involved, and more importantly, he was financially involved. ^t-00-19-33

Now, I guess a better way for me to state this—because I want to be super clear here—is that Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau), who is from a military family and who is saying that he believes in infiltration as a means to climb mountains and overtake society— however, he just described that, right?—was privately directing large sums of money into Turning Point Faith. Okay. He's friends with Rob McCoy. ^t-00-20-07

Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was his friend. I think truly, as a society, that we need to start focusing our attention—independently, village crazy lady. I told you guys about Mel on X. She's been doing great work on this. But you need to start investigating this faith-military constellation. We can call it the militant faith pipeline because it's getting a little much for me. I mean, I told you guys—you start looking at that, and you wonder about other events that have happened in the past, right? There were a ton of conspiracies following October 1st, 2017, when the Las Vegas shooting happened. ^t-00-20-48

And it was almost instantly covered up. Fifty-eight people were murdered; more than 600 others were injured. And they told us that it was just a lone shooter: Stephen Paddock, some crazy guy who acted alone. Conspiracy theorists said it was a military operation, and there was a ton of evidence to support that, okay? Fast-forward a year later—on November 7th of 2018—and there's almost this like Las Vegas shooting hangover that happens in Thousand Oaks, California. ^t-00-21-31

And a victim of that bar shooting was a 27-year-old Navy veteran who had survived the Las Vegas shooting. So it just makes me wonder: was he a victim, or was he a target?

We're not getting answers to any of these questions, and they're telling everybody that these are just conspiracies. It's always a conspiracy when you start questioning these fed narratives. One survivor said that the group of them were meeting up for a second time in about a year—having, I guess, like a little Las Vegas reunion—and that's why they were all there.

We're getting a lot of weird stories about these churches that are coming out. I shared something over the weekend about Romanian sex trafficking on my X feed that is involving one of these churches—one of these big churches out in California. And I'm saying it's time to start prodding the narrative because I'm thinking that perhaps faith has been hijacked.

I don't think that's the case. I think these people that are telling you that you are not allowed to question Israel or you're going to go to hell are not working on behalf of God.

We'll be right back. All right, you guys. I'm going to tell you about PreBorn! because you know that I think it's time for all of us to stand up for truth. We have to be courageous. We have to be done playing defense. We shouldn't water down what we believe to be palatable. Silence is not actually kindness. It is consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds the topic of lives that are lost before they even take their first breaths. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, we have to act like it. And that's why I'm asking you all to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. ^t-00-24-49

Go to preborn.org/Candace right now and give $28. You can give 10 times that if you're able to. This is definitely the line that we have to stand on: standing for truth and what is right.

You should consider adding gold into your financial strategy because when economies destabilize and the markets get scared, currencies can lose value, but gold does not always follow suit. Having some gold means that you are not 100% dependent on just one system. You'll instead have something tangible. For me, it's about planning, and it's about protecting. Of course, I'm not saying that you should run and dump everything into gold because that would be as misguided as sticking with just stocks. But balancing your investments is crucial. If you're worried about retirement or you're worried about the current economy, then let this be your little nudge.

And what I was just referring to in the monologue was in California, where a lot of these churches—megachurches—are. There's been another megachurch pastor that was accused of trafficking children. They have been trafficking children from Romania of all places. And that former megachurch pastor—I'm going to give you his name here—Paul Hagsegard, right?

And I'd like to press my finger here. And I don't particularly love the reaction that we're seeing from Christian Zionists right now. I don't even know how to describe what is happening over in Christian Zionist land. It is wacky. It is definitively exceptional. I've never seen it. There's anger; there's tears; there's frustration; there's fatigue; there's defeat; and of course, there's biblical scripture, right?

"What do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?" Okay, like that's not— like that is—are you out of your mind? Actually, I didn't sell my soul, right? All of you guys did. I had to literally build from scratch because I was rejected everywhere—plus canceled. You shut down; you went after my sponsors; you emailed people; you got me banned from Australia. I actually did the exact opposite. I didn't sell my soul, and I said what was right about what was happening in Gaza. So, there's that. ^t-00-28-16

"Their impact on the right has been devastating." "They've made us weaker, and they've won nothing except clicks and ad revenue for themselves." Pathetic. Strange. I've never been on the same side as Joel Berry. Just want to clarify that. I am never on the side of people that cheer on kids being killed and churches being bombed and insinuate—as he did—that even the Christians in Gaza are really human beings and that they're all supporting Hamas, which is basically justifying a genocide, right? Justification of genocide. I have never been on your side. ^t-00-29-00

I responded on my show with the truth: showed you screenshots of what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had said; said, told you honestly that he had kind of prevented Charlie (Charlie Kirk) from coming up.

Anyways, this is what he wrote on there. "Candace (Candace Owens) recently posted what she claims are more text messages from Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk." He asked ChatGPT to analyze. Look at this next one. If you want to skip over to the next— He analyzed the bubble design, the profile placement, the header layout, font spacing, color balance.

"Each hand washes the other." "It is what Christ talked about as true partnership: reliant yet separate." "None other dominant." "Of course there is struggle, disagreement, but each side gets stronger and sharper because of the other." This is us describing our partnership. These are just real.

You might have money; we have truth. That's what's on our side. Also, to build upon that, I saw a clip of Allie (Allie Beth Stuckey) Stuckey—who I very much like. I've been clear about that. I very much like Allie (Allie Beth Stuckey) Stuckey. I'm very surprised she's working with Alyssa Cordova, but she's also in very rare form. I don't know what's driving that.

You say that you're seeking truth and asking questions, but you're actually just outsourcing your critical thinking and your question-asking to someone else, and you're never really asking questions. You're never saying, "Does that make sense?" "Or what could be the other side of that story?" "Or what is the alternative explanation for that?" "Or are these two things actually connected by evidence?" "Or does it just sound compelling?" This is not a Netflix series. It's not an Agatha Christie novel. You're not watching a whodunit movie.

I genuinely didn't even know she was going through it like this. Like, I didn't. I don't think we asked her for any assistance at all, actually. I did all the work, and people sent me stuff, and then we put together a timeline. And here's what I want to say because you're saying it's real life. It was Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) real life. Allie (Allie Beth Stuckey), that was Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) real life when you saw him sitting there and he got shot. That was his real life. So I feel like that's the part you're missing because you're so worried about the surrounding cast of characters who have been literally caught lying. They lied. That's why we're here. Okay. We didn't just randomly pluck people up from obscurity. Okay. These are people who said he had blood on him. "He's amazing."

Maybe you're not worried about him, but I am. I'm actually worried, and I want to know what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk, okay? And why I feel like you and so many Christian Zionists just kind of wanted to turn him into a ghost—like, you know, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) the friendly ghost—and are not interested at all. And if you're looking for real-life Agatha Christie stuff, in real life, people's necks don't stop .30-06 bullets. In real life—that's all I'm saying.

You wouldn't hide. In four seconds, I would say, "Oh, this is—oh, the reason why I was on the phone with someone, so I had nothing to do with anything." So people are following their instincts because they should. But I just want to remind you—as it bothers me—that was Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) real life, okay?

And regarding Mark Levin (Mark Levin)—if a person was actually like, "You should move to Israel because it would make you happier"— if that was a person, that would be Mark Levin (Mark Levin), okay? Turning Point USA—credit to them—said, "We are not canceling Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson," despite the peer pressure—despite them sending out every queen and pawn on the board to make that happen. They said he's still speaking, and not only is he speaking, but why don't you debate, Mark Levin (Mark Levin)? Debate Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson on stage. And this is how Mark Levin (Mark Levin) responded. ^t-00-38-20

"Good morning," he writes to me. "The leadership at Turning Point has asked me to debate you at their event in Scottsdale in December." "I'm happy to do it, and I hope you'll agree as well." "Beyond the personal insults—which I'll try to keep to a minimum— there are real and important ideological differences between us." "And I think the country would benefit from an extended conversation about them." "So again, I hope you'll accept." "Let me know." "Thanks." The guy is desperate. He's taking a hit on his podcast. He's fighting like hell for his career. ^t-00-39-10

People are awakening to what scum he actually is, and he thinks I'm going to platform him? He thinks I'm going to help him kick up his podcast ratings? What would Charlie (Charlie Kirk) say? What would Rush say? What would any rational response? Here it is. I wrote him the following. "My family and I want nothing to do with you." "What you've become—you're vile lies against my faith, millions of Christians, and in my view, what you seek to do to our country." "There's nothing to debate." "You're a Nazi promoter." "You're the modern-day David Duke." ^t-00-39-54

"I'm also disappointed in TPUSA that continues to platform you." "It's not about free speech." "You can be heard by millions regardless." Some unsolicited advice: "Stop long enough to remember who you used to be and what you used to stand for." So, as expected—knee-jerk. For the record, I'm strongly anti-Nazi. Does he sound that way to you, America? Oh, you're going to hear more. But that's hardly the point. This seems like the perfect opportunity to rebut what you consider evil ideas and to do it to my face like a man. ^t-00-40-35

I'm offering the marketplace of ideas you often talk about. Is it possible you can't really defend, for example, what Israel has done to civilians in Gaza? I said, "There you go." "You're not feared; you're despised." "Well, you're a coward, and if you change your mind, I'm here. Thanks." "You little bastard—you attacked my stepson?" "You didn't do that face-to-face, did you?"

Like what? This would be your opportunity to reveal Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson to the world since you say like that he's a fraud and he's lying and all of this stuff. Like, why wouldn't you readily accept that debate? Why are you so focused on canceling him? And LOL to you saying that you don't want to platform Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson. Yeah, you know what? I decided on this podcast: I'm not going to platform Taylor Swift. Yeah, I'm not going to platform her. So if she ever wants to come on this podcast, I will not platform. Are you this delusional? You cannot be that delusional. You cannot be that delusional. What are you saying? Something is happening.

And so much so— but I'm actually proud to announce that I have finally caught the final Pokémon ball. I've long said that in terms of the names I get called in the media, I feel like I'm playing Pokémon. I just got to catch every single ball. When they try to cancel you, that's what they do. They call you all sorts of things: anti-Semitic. I've been called a self-hating black person. I've been called a homophobe. I've been called a transphobe. I've been called crazy. I've been diagnosed as suffering from postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis—a postpartum depression. And I didn't think there was anything left for me to grab, but it's here. It's final.

Yeah, so because I survived all their attacks and have focused my energy on what I wanted to build and not on who I want to destroy, they have decided that that's because I'm leading a cult. Now when I think of a cult, I typically think of people who say like, "Oh, you're going to get into heaven if you defend Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu)." It says it right here in the Bible that if you don't unfollow Candace (Candace Owens) Owens, you won't go to heaven. That to me is cult language—promising people that their souls are somehow tied to following your instructions. I'm just trying to figure out who killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk. That's all. I want to know who killed my friend. ^t-00-43-42

And so she's an expert on this. And she has now watched 10 episodes of this show. She watched the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk series, and she has determined that if you are interested in what I have to say and what I am uncovering about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk's assassination, then you—you at home— are in a cult. Take it away, Carrie (Carrie Smith). ^t-00-44-20

I think she is exhibiting several cult tactics. She's demonstrating several different tactics. I think she's using manipulative language and a lot of cluster-B personality disorder behavior. I think that it's easy to observe that, but apparently it's not easy for some people, I guess. And I'm assuming maybe that's because they haven't been through that before with someone. Maybe they haven't experienced it before. And so this is not an episode for people who are in that cult. It's not an episode for people who are just hanging on every word and following it. I've interacted with quite a few of you, and I'm not trying to convince you. ^t-00-44-50

This isn't for you. This is an episode for normies who are trying to figure out what's happening because—like a lot of us—they used to put a lot of trust in Candace (Candace Owens) Owens and some of these other influential figures, and they're like, "What is happening?" "What happened to her?" ^t-00-45-34

But I do want to—can you just bring her up for a second without playing it? I can't be the only person that's really stressed out by how she's organizing those books. Like that is like—I've—that is—I don't like the way those books are at all. That really is stressing me out, so... Whew, she's lucky I'm not nine months pregnant because this would not fly. I would be organizing that. Why the different levels? Anyways, she's queen of diagnosing this, I guess. Cluster-B personality. Now, what I will say is this is—if you go back any fed operation—COVID—whenever you don't follow the federal narrative, if you don't listen to the government, they always diagnose you with Machiavellian—what do they call it? ^t-00-46-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=2814" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:46:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-46-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Like the dark triad traits: Machiavellian, narcissistic—and they say that you're in a cult. If you don't wear a mask—"save lives." They did the same exact stuff. You can go back—literally go back. This is their final stage of "We're not getting people to behave and listen to us, so we're going to diagnose them." And she listed all of the reasons—the signs that I was in a cult—and about seven of them. One of them is forced teaming. She says that I use inclusive language like "us, us, we, we—we will solve this." Again, what is it about "they" and "we"? What is it about plurality that stresses these people out so much? These are just words. I do think we are going to solve this. I say "we" because all the information I have is thanks to the tip line. ^t-00-46-54

Yeah, she also says that I repeat myself constantly—that I use sarcasm. And I would say that this is sounding a lot like my toddlers—who could be in a cult. Now that I'm thinking about it, she might be right because they are laughing; they are sarcastic; they definitely have used terms like "we" and "us" when they address me and their father; and they repeat themselves the whole time—the whole time—so stay tuned. And then my favorite part is that she says like—we have a phrase, and it's "If you don't know, no." ^t-00-47-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=2899" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:48:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-48-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** She's like, "We don't know, no—but we know." And she says that that's somehow cult—I don't know; it's a part of the cult stuff. So I guess I'm the cult of telling you to think for yourself and to trust your gut. And if something seems like it's wrong, it's because it probably is wrong. And the government telling you to violate that—to ignore your sense, your senses—to believe something that is just truly unbelievable, like a .30-06 got stopped by Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) neck because miracle. Yeah, trust yourself. That is kind of the goal here: to let people stop committing to government groupthink, which is how they control us all and also make us hate each other. It is just a fact that the greatest threat to governments—and what this is really about—is the left and the right coming together, right? ^t-00-48-19

And this is why I am now number one in who they are attacking. I'm talking about the military-industrial complex, which has been ruling our nation for a very long time. I'm encouraging people to read books—to learn about the history of psychology and why they do these sorts of things like diagnose you. I'm telling people that they should homeschool their kids, right? So they don't end up like us. And when I say "like us"—committed to one side or the other, convinced that we have things figured out when we're shouting at each other and not looking at the real power apparatus that sits behind. So to that extent, I do understand why Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and I have become threat number one—showing that you can survive outside of their matrix, not taking money—not taking the money that makes you fearful to speak out—and surviving it. ^t-00-49-03

But we're not getting rid of this first off. We don't know, no—but we know. Okay. And it's a fact, and we are going to solve the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk murder. So we'll take a quick break, and then I'll read some of your comments. All right, you guys. The biggest health secret that is not talked about is that everything begins in our guts. Every day, your gut is fighting a silent war against processed foods, work stress, and toxins in the air that you breathe. When your gut is in trouble, your whole body feels it. Most probiotics do not work. Ninety-nine percent of the traditional brands die in your stomach acid before they reach your gut. That's what makes Just Thrive's spore-based probiotic completely different. Just Thrive is the only probiotic that's clinically proven to arrive 100% alive in your gut, ^t-00-49-47

Also, I want to remind you guys about American Financing because the Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that is great news for American homeowners. If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than right now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is just so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. With the rates dropping, now is the time to think about paying off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They're saving people just like you an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in the below fives. That is a complete game-changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. ^t-00-51-13

Think Before You Type wrote, "Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) was all for Candace (Candace Owens) Owens keeping it real with the black community until she started keeping it real with Israel." And that, my friend, is a fact. And here's the thing: I don't care who you are. I'm an equal-opportunity offender.

Being a woman's not going to protect you; being black is not going to protect you; being Jewish—none of it's—it's just not going to work if you're going to use identity politics. And right now, it is just the case that Zionists are being a little cray-cray—a lot of cray-cray—very cray-cray—and kind of dangerous. Also, I want to tell you—by the way—one of the things that she mentioned as a sign of a cult was me reading comments at the end. Obviously, you guys pay for me to read these comments, and you guys compliment me—which is very kind. And so she said that me reading your comments is a cult-leader tactic. But I'm going to keep reading these comments. U.S. Flagpole Guy writes, "We love you, Candace (Candace Owens)." "We pray for you and your family." "And for truth: fight, fight, fight."

"You are truly armor-bearer." "Be my David." Yeah, they've cited that as well. And I was like, "I just shared Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) messages, and he knew he was going to die." And that is actually—in retrospect—incredibly compelling. And I wish I had... I guess there's nothing else I could have done. There's really nothing I could have done. I have to remind myself of that. Zamet writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), number one worldwide secret sauce." "She speaks to us, not at us." Yeah, we're just trying to figure out what's going on, and we know that what they're telling us is going on is definitely not what's going on. And my requirement is pretty easy: Are you interested?

Not a shred of proof. They won't show us a clear picture of Tyler Robinson on that day—despite all the cameras. That would do a lot. If they just dropped one clear image, right? We would be like, "Oh, at least he was on campus." Like, at least we can get there. Nothing. They're just like, "Trust us 1000%, and we're going to make the physics—it's totally—everything's impossible, but just trust us."

Go tell that to cult lady. She's going to be really upset about that. Aries Girl writes, "Seven Mountain Mandate—you're referring to." Makes me think of Satan tempting Christ in the quote from Elder Ephraim: "The person who limits his mind to the name of Christ, the hour of death, the beauty of paradise, and the love of God will purge it of every demonic contemplation."

Okay, that's very interesting. What I will say is it's giving cults to say you can infiltrate in the name of the Lord—which means be deceptive, right? You can be deceptive in the name of the Lord. It doesn't make me feel good knowing that he was putting money into Turning Point USA Faith. And like I said, we are going to have some explosive revelations on Wednesday that's going to make you rethink everything. And Turning Point Faith keeps coming up in this investigation. I think money was being injected. And I don't think—I think when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) raised his head and realized something was wrong—and that's why he established DOGE—he made some real enemies. ^t-00-55-35

He would have arrived at the answer very quickly. He learned very quickly, processed information very quickly. And to the extent that he was paying attention, he would have found out. That's just a fact. It is not a small thing. They tried to reduce it. It's not a small thing that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) suddenly was wondering about where the money was coming from and where it was going to. On that note, later on this week, we'll be having a guest join us that will speak on Friday about Turning Point's finances, and that's going to paint a big picture. ^t-00-56-19

I was in a true stage of grief. I didn't offer a single interview. Well, Alex Clark figured out—she rumbled to me—that I spoke to CNN in a—I had already scheduled CNN for my book promo, and we kept the interview on September 27th or something. And she's like, "Well, she lied." "She spoke to CNN." That interview was supposed to be exclusively about my book promotion—my background, what brought me to this moment. And actually, ^t-00-56-54

She didn't mention my book at all—which is quite stunning in retrospect by the end—because she was trying to hammer me—not on the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) stuff—but she was trying to hammer me so much on Zionism—you know, Israel—is kind of what she wanted to speak about. And then Brigitte Macron is what she wanted to speak about. Anyways, speaking of this book—I loved seeing this online: "Make Him a Sandwich." Somebody in Serbia got the book, and her husband fake-signed it. He forged my signature, and he wrote to her—I can't read her name—"Dear Kiki, please make me a sandwich," and I can't read that—something, something—and then he signs it himself. He signs it "xoxo, Candace (Candace Owens)." ^t-00-57-38

So I had to pull that out. That's all the way from Belgrade, Serbia. I reached out to her, and we're now going to send her a free signed copy because it made me giggle so much this morning. And if you guys would like to get your copy, you can go to MakeHimASandwich.com. This book is doing fantastic, and we're really excited about that. So yeah—what else do I have for you guys? Thank you for supporting me. X is crazy. I don't know why, but there's a Zionist picture that is emerging in this story. It's a faith picture. ^t-00-58-22

I would say this isn't an Agatha Christie novel. Real life is actually better than an Agatha Christie novel. I'm realizing there is so much corruption that is happening, and we are now in a time of tremendous revelation. So if you are working for the side of darkness, you are probably right about now on notice. We'll see you guys on Wednesday. ^t-00-58-54
