I don't know what's going on. I'm just going to say... That is kind of weird how the only people that seem to believe the fed story are <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span>, and they demand that we accept the fed story. And their panic is making me think that we're getting closer to something, and that something is pretty big, and it's going to implicate a lot of people. I don't know. ^t-00-00-41

So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-01-21"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. Okay, so something that I want to say right at the top here before we get further into the <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> story and speaking about <a href="/entities/event-january-6th.md">January 6th</a> and how somehow that's connected. There's something I learned that's bothering me. I'm just going to put it out there. See if it bothers you as well. ^t-00-01-21

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-02-01.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:01</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=121" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But I learned via tips that <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-02-01"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span> immediately seized the footage at <span id="ent-org-timpanogos-regional-hospital-t-00-02-01"><a href="/entities/org-timpanogos-regional-hospital.md">Timpanogos Hospital</a></span>. Okay, <a href="/entities/org-timpanogos-regional-hospital.md">Timpanogos Hospital</a>. Remember, this is the hospital that it was quite strange that they moved to take <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> to because it was further and also less equipped than <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-02-01"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UV Hospital</a></span>. It was like UV was a trauma one, and Timpanogos was trauma three, and a bunch of people said, "Very strange that they took him here." And then it got strange because we started hearing from other people that he was definitely at <a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UV Hospital</a>. It was very weird. Anyways, I'd like to add to that by saying... ^t-00-02-01

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-02-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=159" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And on the day that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-39"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was shot—for whatever reason, you know—<span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-02-39"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash</a></span> injects himself into it. <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-02-39"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">The feds</a></span> seized all of the footage at the hospital that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was brought to at Timpanogos. That doesn't make sense to me. Nothing makes sense to me in this whole story. So this is just kind of the icing on, you know, on the top here—not even the icing on the top. But why would they move to seize that footage? How is that going to help their investigation? What's happening inside of Timpanogos? How is that going to help their investigation? Their immediate boots-on-the-ground investigation into who shot <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. They're trying. They're on a manhunt. Why are they going, "Okay, let's at first grab the footage at Timpanogos"? Does that make sense? Were you worried? ^t-00-02-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-03-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=200" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Did the nurse call 911 and say, "Oh, a guy just ran in here with a gun," and you need to seize the footage because that's going to help you track them down? If that didn't happen, why are you seizing that footage? I don't know. With everything that is going on, and I would say almost the lack of information that we have at Timpanogos—on a single person who captured them pulling up—nothing, despite the fact that there were news cameras outside waiting, oddly from like a <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-t-00-03-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york.md">New York</a></span> news channel. We have not seen anything that we can build in confidently on our timeline that would let us know what time in particular <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> arrived at the hospital. ^t-00-03-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-03-59.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:59</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=239" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I feel like something's amiss if <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-03-59"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span> move to grab the footage inside of the hospital immediately and outside of the hospital immediately. So just putting it out there. If you maybe were somebody who has footage and saw that black SUV pull up at the hospital, please get that to us at MoreTips@CandaceOwens.com because it's starting to bother me. Something there is starting to feel amiss. Everything's amiss. Anyway, there also happens to be another interesting constellation that's building here because, as I said at the top, there is something about this investigation into <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-59"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> ^t-00-03-59

And by powerful people, I mean <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-04-37"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span>, okay? I don't know about you, but I'm starting to wonder if every major publicly traumatizing event they have actually just been organized by <a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a>. And rather than blaming themselves, the strategy that they always employ is to get out a narrative—a sloppy narrative—like we saw this time with the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-37"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> assassination. That is one thing that I will say is so amazing. The only thing that has been amazing about the <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> assassination is that it has brought the left and the right together. ^t-00-04-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-05-21.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:21</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=321" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And what I mean by that is typically we're ready to take the fed slop. This time it was the messages, obviously. And they're like, "Oh, my dad's <span id="ent-concept-maga-movement-t-00-05-21"><a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a></span>." "He just—he was MAGAing too hard." And the left was supposed to go, "See, it's his dad's fault." "<a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a>'s bad." And then the right was supposed to go, "Look, trans person bad." This time though, we all went, "This is too evil." It feels orchestrated. And do you guys always do this? Like, is this what you guys do? That definitely—now that I'm reflecting, and I am including myself in this—that was kind of my old vibe: left or right. That was definitely the vibe of <span id="ent-event-january-6th-t-00-05-21"><a href="/entities/event-january-6th.md">January 6th</a></span>, right? We all took the bait. Just own it, okay? If you're a lefty, own it. You were like, "<a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a> is bad." ^t-00-05-21

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-06-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=366" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** If you're on the right, own it. We were like, "The left is bad." "They're overthrowing an election." We did it. On <span id="ent-event-january-6th-t-00-06-06"><a href="/entities/event-january-6th.md">January 6th</a></span>, 2021, I can tell you where I was. I was nine months pregnant—my first child—and I was super <span id="ent-concept-maga-movement-t-00-06-06"><a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a></span> at this time. I would have definitively gone to this stop-the-steal rally, but I was just too pregnant to go. And I was living in D.C., so it was just down the street from me. And I reflect on that, and I think, "Wow, that saved me," because I could have been swept up in what happened on <a href="/entities/event-january-6th.md">January 6th</a>. I could have been there. We all know how the story goes. <span id="ent-person-donald-trump-t-00-06-06"><a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Trump</a></span> hosts this speech. He has this rally. And then afterward, people—quote-unquote—storm the Capitol, break through the barriers. And there's an insurrection, and CNN is showing these clips in the footage. ^t-00-06-06

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-06-50.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:50</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=410" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And it's funny for me, especially because I was right up the road, and as a resident of D.C.—literally living there. And I was thinking how strange it was. I'm sitting on the couch with my husband. We start getting all these phone calls—like from my sisters and family members—asking if we're okay. And we didn't have the news on, and we're like, "Yeah, we're okay." "So strange that you're calling." "We don't even hear any noise." And it was actually the first time that there was peace in D.C., meaning it was the summer of <span id="ent-org-black-lives-matter-t-00-06-50"><a href="/entities/org-black-lives-matter.md">BLM</a></span> riots. So it was strange that we never got called when people's cars were getting smashed and things were being burned to the ground. But suddenly we were getting phone calls because the media was there, you know, right there. "The <span id="ent-concept-maga-movement-t-00-06-50"><a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a></span> has gone too far," and they were showing all this footage, and it was out of place, right? ^t-00-06-50

That was it.

And we just don't know who did that because I live there, and there—I mean, it's the capital. So every square inch, there's a camera. You just can't do that. You can't just get away from being a couple of blocks away from the <span id="ent-org-white-house-t-00-07-31"><a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a></span> and dropping off pipe bombs, right? ^t-00-07-31

I want to talk to you for a moment about this concept called the 7M Mandate. In reality, it started with a conversation I had in the year 2000. I had been talking to <span id="ent-person-loren-cunningham-t-00-13-59"><a href="/entities/person-loren-cunningham.md">Loren Cunningham</a></span>, who's the founder of <span id="ent-org-youth-with-a-mission-t-00-13-59"><a href="/entities/org-youth-with-a-mission.md">Youth With A Mission</a></span>, and Loren was sharing with me about a conversation he had had with Bill Bright. The two of them were visited actually by the Lord within the same 24 hours, and God spoke to them and said they had a message to give the other man. And the message was that there are seven molders of culture or seven world kingdoms, and that he who could take those kingdoms could take the harvest of nations. Now this illustration is the way I see it. I look at it this way. ^t-00-13-59

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-14-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:14:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=881" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Lance Wallnau:** I see those seven molders of culture as being the religion mountain as a metaphor for something you've got to take or climb. Then we have education; we could say family. These are in no particular order of importance. They all represent the forces that shape societies and nations: government, media, arts— which is the entertainment mountain—and business, which is where we have the economics mountain happening also. Now these seven fields of influence are very powerful—so powerful, in fact, that he who occupies the top of those mountains can literally shape the agenda that forms nations. ^t-00-14-41

The good news is you can do that covertly, or you can do that overtly. You can be—like I always say—you could actually be following that thing from Jehovah-Rophi, Jehovah-Nissi, Jehovah-Tsidkenu, or Jehovah-Sneaky, because God has a way of getting into positions, companies, businesses, nations, and communities before the <span id="ent-concept-devil-t-00-15-24"><a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a></span> even knows what got in there, because the gospel is bigger than just the church mountain.

You should consider adding gold into your financial strategy because when economies destabilize and the markets get scared, currencies can lose value, but gold does not always follow suit. Having some gold means that you are not 100% dependent on just one system. You'll instead have something tangible. For me, it's about planning, and it's about protecting. Of course, I'm not saying that you should run and dump everything into gold because that would be as misguided as sticking with just stocks. But balancing your investments is crucial.

Like that is like—I've—that is—I don't like the way those books are at all. That really is stressing me out, so... Whew, she's lucky I'm not nine months pregnant because this would not fly. I would be organizing that. Why the different levels? Anyways, she's queen of diagnosing this, I guess. Cluster-B personality.

And she says that that's somehow cult—I don't know; it's a part of the cult stuff. So I guess I'm the cult of telling you to think for yourself and to trust your gut. And if something seems like it's wrong, it's because it probably is wrong. And the government telling you to violate that—to ignore your sense, your senses—to believe something that is just truly unbelievable, like a .30-06 got stopped by <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-48-19"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) neck because miracle. Yeah, trust yourself. That is kind of the goal here: to let people stop committing to government groupthink, which is how they control us all and also make us hate each other. It is just a fact that the greatest threat to governments—and what this is really about—is the left and the right coming together, right? ^t-00-48-19

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YaZfwLQ7vrI/t-00-49-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:49:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZfwLQ7vrI&t=2943" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** This is like the thing that they have to prevent. And this is why I am now number one in who they are attacking. I'm talking about the military-industrial complex, which has been ruling our nation for a very long time. I'm encouraging people to read books—to learn about the history of psychology and why they do these sorts of things like diagnose you. I'm telling people that they should homeschool their kids, right? So they don't end up like us. And when I say "like us"—committed to one side or the other, convinced that we have things figured out when we're shouting at each other and not looking at the real power apparatus that sits behind. So to that extent, I do understand why <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-49-03"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> and I have become threat number one—showing that you can survive outside of their matrix, not taking money—not taking the money that makes you fearful to speak out—and surviving it. ^t-00-49-03

But we're not getting rid of this first off. We don't know, no—but we know. Okay. And it's a fact, and we are going to solve the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-49-47"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> murder. So we'll take a quick break, and then I'll read some of your comments. All right, you guys. The biggest health secret that is not talked about is that everything begins in our guts. Every day, your gut is fighting a silent war against processed foods, work stress, and toxins in the air that you breathe. When your gut is in trouble, your whole body feels it. Most probiotics do not work. Ninety-nine percent of the traditional brands die in your stomach acid before they reach your gut. That's what makes Just Thrive's spore-based probiotic completely different. Just Thrive is the only probiotic that's clinically proven to arrive 100% alive in your gut, ^t-00-49-47

Also, I want to remind you guys about <span id="ent-org-american-financing-t-00-51-13"><a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a></span> because <span id="ent-org-federal-reserve-t-00-51-13"><a href="/entities/org-federal-reserve.md">the Fed</a></span> just dropped interest rates again, and that is great news for American homeowners. If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than right now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is just so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. With the rates dropping, now is the time to think about paying off that debt. <a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a> is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They're saving people just like you an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in the below fives. That is a complete game-changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. ^t-00-51-13

Think Before You Type wrote, "Ben <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-51-56"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Shapiro</a></span> was all for <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-51-56"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> keeping it real with the black community until she started keeping it real with <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-51-56"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>." And that, my friend, is a fact. And here's the thing: I don't care who you are. I'm an equal-opportunity offender.

Being a woman's not going to protect you; being black is not going to protect you; being Jewish—none of it's—it's just not going to work if you're going to use identity politics. And right now, it is just the case that <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-52-41"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> are being a little cray-cray—a lot of cray-cray—very cray-cray—and kind of dangerous. Also, I want to tell you—by the way—one of the things that she mentioned as a sign of a cult was me reading comments at the end. Obviously, you guys pay for me to read these comments, and you guys compliment me—which is very kind. And so she said that me reading your comments is a cult-leader tactic. But I'm going to keep reading these comments. U.S. Flagpole Guy writes, "We love you, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-52-41"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>." "We pray for you and your family." "And for truth: fight, fight, fight." Thank you so much for that donation. ^t-00-52-41

"You are truly armor-bearer." "Be my David." Yeah, they've cited that as well. And I was like, "I just shared <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) messages, and he knew he was going to die." And that is actually—in retrospect—incredibly compelling. And I wish I had... I guess there's nothing else I could have done. There's really nothing I could have done. I have to remind myself of that. Zamet writes, "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-53-21"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, number one worldwide secret sauce." "She speaks to us, not at us." Yeah, we're just trying to figure out what's going on, and we know that what they're telling us is going on is definitely not what's going on. And my requirement is pretty easy: Are you interested? They're asking you to be an idiot. Just be an idiot. ^t-00-53-21

Not a shred of proof. They won't show us a clear picture of <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-54-05"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> on that day—despite all the cameras. That would do a lot. If they just dropped one clear image, right? We would be like, "Oh, at least he was on campus." Like, at least we can get there. Nothing. They're just like, "Trust us 1000%, and we're going to make the physics—it's totally—everything's impossible, but just trust us." We're asking for such little—if you actually go back and appreciate how the story has unfolded. ^t-00-54-05

They're giving us nothing and telling us to swallow it whole. We just can't do that, okay? We just cannot do that. <span id="ent-person-mickey-shaw-t-00-54-47"><a href="/entities/person-mickey-shaw.md">Mickey Shaw</a></span> writes, "We love you, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-54-47"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>."

Aries Girl writes, "<span id="ent-concept-seven-mountain-mandate-t-00-54-47"><a href="/entities/concept-seven-mountain-mandate.md">Seven Mountain Mandate</a></span>—you're referring to." Makes me think of Satan tempting Christ in the quote from Elder Ephraim: "The person who limits his mind to the name of Christ, the hour of death, the beauty of paradise, and the love of God will purge it of every demonic contemplation." The note here is Ephraim was a revered Greek Orthodox hieromonk —does that say hieromonk? ^t-00-54-47

Okay, that's very interesting. What I will say is it's giving cults to say you can infiltrate in the name of the Lord—which means be deceptive, right? You can be deceptive in the name of the Lord.

And like I said, we are going to have some explosive revelations on Wednesday that's going to make you rethink everything. And <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">Turning Point Faith</a> keeps coming up in this investigation. I think money was being injected. And I don't think—I think when <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-55-35"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> raised his head and realized something was wrong—and that's why he established <span id="ent-concept-doge-t-00-55-35"><a href="/entities/concept-doge.md">DOGE</a></span>—he made some real enemies. ^t-00-55-35

He would have arrived at the answer very quickly. He learned very quickly, processed information very quickly. And to the extent that he was paying attention, he would have found out. That's just a fact. It is not a small thing. They tried to reduce it. It's not a small thing that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> suddenly was wondering about where the money was coming from and where it was going to. On that note, later on this week, we'll be having a guest join us that will speak on Friday about <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-56-19"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span>'s finances, and that's going to paint a big picture. ^t-00-56-19

She didn't mention my book at all—which is quite stunning in retrospect by the end—because she was trying to hammer me—not on the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-57-38"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> stuff—but she was trying to hammer me so much on <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-57-38"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionism</a></span>—you know, <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-57-38"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>—is kind of what she wanted to speak about. And then <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-57-38"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a></span> is what she wanted to speak about.

Somebody in <span id="ent-gpe-serbia-t-00-57-38"><a href="/entities/gpe-serbia.md">Serbia</a></span> got the book, and her husband fake-signed it. He forged my signature, and he wrote to her—I can't read her name—"Dear Kiki, please make me a sandwich," and I can't read that—something, something—and then he signs it himself.

So I had to pull that out. That's all the way from Belgrade, <span id="ent-gpe-serbia-t-00-58-22"><a href="/entities/gpe-serbia.md">Serbia</a></span>. I reached out to her, and we're now going to send her a free signed copy because it made me giggle so much this morning.

This book is doing fantastic, and we're really excited about that. So yeah—what else do I have for you guys? Thank you for supporting me. X is crazy. I don't know why, but there's a <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-58-22"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a></span> picture that is emerging in this story.

I would say this isn't an <span id="ent-person-agatha-christie-t-00-58-54"><a href="/entities/person-agatha-christie.md">Agatha Christie</a></span> novel. Real life is actually better than an <a href="/entities/person-agatha-christie.md">Agatha Christie</a> novel.
