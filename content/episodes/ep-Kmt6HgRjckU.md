I am here. And I gotta tell you, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> discussing the JFK assassination, that sure is something. If you haven't yet seen this clip that's making the rounds, we have it for you. And it makes it kind of hilarious, even more hilarious that the very organization that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a><span id="event-event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-assassination---charlie-sho-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-assassination---charlie-sho.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> built is trying to sell to the public that the very idea of a government sanctioned assassination is crazy. And on that point, another interesting lead has come in regarding the potential French connection, regarding which I should mention that <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash</a></span> has been directly asked about their potential involvement in <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s assassination. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-00-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=43" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And his answer, his reply to that question is stunning. I should say actually it's a non-answer. So welcome back to Candace. What do you guys think Charlie Kirk would have said about his own assassination? Just think about that. What would his perspective have been on everything that we are currently being told, people that are being attacked about it? ^t-00-00-43

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-01-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=80" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I think about that actually often and listening to his perspectives regarding political<span id="event-event-2025-05-01-charlie-kirk-discusses-jfk-assassination-t-00-01-20"><a href="/events/event-2025-05-01-charlie-kirk-discusses-jfk-assassination.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> assassinations of the past in retrospect really is something So at one of his, honestly, one of his last events in May of this year, Charlie was directly asked his opinion regarding <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">John F. Kennedy</a></span>'s assassination down in <span id="ent-gpe-dallas-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-dallas.md">Dallas</a></span>. And here is what Charlie had to say. ^t-00-01-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-01-46.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:46</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=106" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Charlie Kirk:** <span id="claim-claim-6d5baa59e175-t-00-01-46">In the <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span> files, <span id="ent-org-mossad-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/org-mossad.md">Mossad</a></span> is mentioned<a href="/claims/claim-6d5baa59e175.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. One of the reasons why <a href="/entities/org-mossad.md">Mossad</a> is mentioned so much is that they're just a very good intelligence operation. It was not mentioned as if they were tied or that they knew about it or that they were involved. Again, I think the best reading of what happened there is who wanted <a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a> dead the most. Again, a lot of people said <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> wanted <a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a> dead.<span id="event-event-1963-11-22-jfk-assassination-in-dallas---charlie-ki-t-00-01-46"><a href="/events/event-1963-11-22-jfk-assassination-in-dallas---charlie-ki.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> I'd love to hear that argument. <span id="claim-claim-548825ae6d99-t-00-01-46">But definitely, <a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">Lyndon Baines Johnson</a> and parts of our own government and the Cubans wanted him dead<a href="/claims/claim-548825ae6d99.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. And who actually made it happen? There were like 15 or 20 things that happened that day that were inexcusable. They changed the parade route. He rode in an open air convertible. <span id="ent-person-lyndon-baines-johnson-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">LBJ</a></span> decided not to ride alongside of him. The vehicle slowed down right when it went by the <span id="ent-gpe-texas-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-texas.md">Texas</a></span> schoolbook depository. A lot there, right? ^t-00-01-46

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-02-30.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:30</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=150" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Charlie Kirk:** And then, again, I think that all of us are smarter to believe that it was simply <span id="ent-person-lee-harvey-oswald-t-00-02-30"><a href="/entities/person-lee-harvey-oswald.md">Lee Harvey Oswald</a></span>. The more important question is not, oh, who did it? We have to first acknowledge it, that more than one person did it. Once we acknowledge that more than one person did it, then we can expose our government to have lied to us about the JFK assassination, which then I think will sober a lot of us about trusting the government in the future. I mean, yes, all of that. ^t-00-02-30

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-02-59.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:59</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=179" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Thank you, Charlie Kirk, for reminding us that you had common sense, that you didn't accept force-fed narratives, that you did not accept the BS crap that our government has sold us regarding the one individual that was involved in JFK's assassination. Of course, multiple people were involved and a lot of strange things occurred on that day. That is what makes his answer there so compelling, okay? Especially in the midst of, well, MKUltra 2.0. Remember the first government psyop on the people, MKUltra, what actually came together, sorry, I should say <span id="ent-concept-operation-mockingbird-t-00-02-59"><a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingbird.md">Mockingbird</a></span> 2.0. ^t-00-02-59

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-03-34.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:34</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=214" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The first government psyop on the people following JFK's assassination, <a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingbird.md">Mockingbird</a> 1.0, to convince everybody through influence that there was nothing to see here, even though there was so much to see there. And now it's being deployed again, <a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingbird.md">Mockingbird</a>, <span id="ent-concept-operation-mockingbird-t-00-03-34"><a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingbird.md">Operation Mockingbird</a></span> 2.0, to convince people that questions about the Charlie Kirk narrative are just crazy. How dare you consider that there may have been employees at Turning Point USA who could be engaged in an obvious cover up at this moment? Well, Frank (Frank Turek) says that's so crazy because that would mean that Charlie Kirk hired people that ultimately betrayed him. And no one's ever been betrayed by people that they trust in the history of the world. ^t-00-03-34

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-04-16.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:16</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=256" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, well, actually, maybe that did happen for Jesus Christ. That's just one historical example of a person surrounded by somebody that they trust who would ultimately betray them. And yes, JFK, who personally selected Lyndon Baines Johnson to be his vice president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, who was clearly implicated in JFK's assassination. Charlie rightfully says that, that that is obvious by now. So yeah, it's all very plausible. Oh, and Charlie, you can see, does not readily dismiss the idea that the Mossad may have been involved. He says he'd like to hear more of an argument on that. ^t-00-04-16

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-04-59.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:59</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=299" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** as he asserts that definitively parts of our government had to have been involved. And he says, the Cubans, the commies wanted him dead. Charlie is encouraging the inquiry further. Who wanted JFK dead the most? Well, we should continue down that path. Who wanted Charlie Kirk dead the most and why? And Charlie was very much in the political fast lane. And in the political fast lane, they want you dead for really one or all of these three reasons, money, secrets, and or power. We know that Charlie said no to money right before he died. ^t-00-04-59

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-05-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=343" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I think that means he probably knew a secret right before he died. And there is no doubt that his youth political organization had achieved a considerable amount of political power. Could there have been global implications? Of course, people are laughing, they've been laughing this entire time, because just following the evidence of what transpired on that day, a lot of odd things that transpired on that day, just like on the day of JFK's assassination, well, that pointed us into the direction of a particular satellite of countries and continents that have somehow come up in this investigation. I'll paint that for you now. ^t-00-05-43

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-06-27.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=387" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Yes, we have mentioned <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-06-27"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span>. Yes, we have mentioned Israel. Yes, we have mentioned the United States government. And yes, we have mentioned Egypt. which is in Africa. Wow, that seems crazy. People also laughed when I said that there was thereafter a viable threat, which came from the Macron couple who apparently paid for my assassination. And yet strangely, neither the Pentagon nor the White House or our intel agencies or the Élysée Palace are disputing that narrative. And now we can add officially the FBI ^t-00-06-27

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-07-01.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:01</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=421" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** to that list of agencies that aren't denying that threat because Kash (Kash Patel) recently gave an interview to <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a> and like an actual journalist and not a cutesy, weepsy influencer like Camp Migby. Don't laugh, don't laugh. <span id="claim-claim-57648c8778e8-t-00-07-01"><span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-07-01"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span> asked him directly about the Macron couple and about the allegation that they attempted to orchestrate an assassination on my life and, of course, whether or not they could have been involved in Charlie Kirk's assassination, which I have said, right<a href="/claims/claim-57648c8778e8.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>? Here is what Kash (Kash Patel) says in response, or rather what he doesn't say in response. Take a listen. ^t-00-07-01

Have you looked into either of those? Do you believe she's received a credible death threat from the French or that the French had something potentially to do with Charlie's death? ^t-00-07-40

So we're not going to turn our eye away from that investigation or any others. If there's anything to it, this FBI will respond to it. OK, but so far, no. So we are just looking at everything that comes in. We're not going to reject any piece of information. If someone feels that their life is being threatened, we are, of course, looking at it. ^t-00-08-04

Because actually it kind of left me on read. There has been no communication with the FBI. You are aware right there, Megyn Kelly is asking you directly about it. So you can't pretend you didn't receive it. And you are choosing to skip over. He completely skips over the part about me having asserted, which Megyn asks him directly, you know, was France involved in trial for assassination? He doesn't even address that. Skips right over it and instead says, if any American has a threat, that's what we're here for. And she's like, okay, but was there actually a threat? If anybody, let's just kind of make it, say it more broadly, we will take it seriously. Well, you're not doing that, Kash (Kash Patel). ^t-00-08-35

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-09-15.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:15</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=555" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I find it very odd that I said that I had proof that the government of France was involved in Charlie Kirk's assassination, that they were on the ground that day. <span id="claim-claim-d30096afb372-t-00-09-15">And you have not reached out to me<a href="/claims/claim-d30096afb372.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. In this very interview that you are asserting that you are certain that Tyler Robinson is the only person involved, how can you be certain if you are not reaching out to people that claim to have verifiable evidence which could dispute that narrative? Does it seem to you like he's telling the truth there? Does it seem to you like he's being open and he's being transparent or does it seem like he's intentionally being cagey because he knows that I am telling the truth despite the many millions of dollars that is being spent on this Operation Mockingbird 2.0 campaign. ^t-00-09-15

That's why they are turning to influencers to try to tell you not to look that way. Candace is crazy. Oh my gosh, like Candace must have made this up. But the people that are in power are not telling you that I made this up, even when they are given the opportunity to do so. They are choosing to stay silent, okay? And I am waiting for all of this to be uncovered because this is bigger than we could have ever imagined. And it is very clear to me that our satellite of nations involved in this is not so implausible. In fact, maybe it's very plausible that all of these states are somehow involved in Charlie Kirk's assassination. ^t-00-09-57

Like that this could be maybe somehow Charlie was being asked to be brought in. He built an organization that has a presence, I think in all 50 states, actually in all 50 states. And that presents a certain opportunity like for potentially trafficking. ^t-00-10-40

And that there was another Pierre that we should be looking into right and what I'm going to say is, despite this tip and indicating that turning point people that work with turning point or one of their, you know, action organizations who knows which organization they have a few. took a meeting with this particular Pierre, we cannot verify that yet. We would like to verify that information. And if you know more, please email us more tips at candaceowens.com.

In short, the scandal happened during the civil war in <span id="ent-gpe-angola-t-00-12-44"><a href="/entities/gpe-angola.md">Angola</a></span>. So you have an African country, there is a civil war, you should just know instinctively that none of these civil wars are organic. No civil war ever was organic. Not even our civil war was organic.

Anyways, it gets discovered during the course of French elections, and this is dating back to 1999, that the French government is actually involved in trafficking weapons, military-grade weapons to Angola to facilitate this war. and they did this through an illicit network of countries. The public learns this and it turns out that France is involved, Russia is involved, Slovakia is involved. <span id="claim-claim-8177c64f72fc-t-00-13-24">They're using this company, which is known as <span id="ent-org-branko-international-t-00-13-24"><a href="/entities/org-branko-international.md">Branko International</a></span>, to sell these arms to the Angolan president<a href="/claims/claim-8177c64f72fc.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. ^t-00-13-24

He's also, of course, the president of the Congress of Jewish Religious Communities. So you can't question anything he does. It's anti-Semitic. And his partner is Pierre Falcone. Pierre Falcone is born in Algeria. He moves to France after the Algerian Civil War. So I'm just going to bring up the players here very quickly.

All right, you guys, I'll ask the question, what are you doing today to protect your tomorrow? Because waiting until later, that's not really an option. We're already living in the later.

Through our partnership with Preborn, we can help save babies and support mothers that are in need because every day, Preborn's clinics are rescuing hundreds of babies because when a mother sees her baby on an ultrasound and hears that tiny heartbeat, her chance of choosing life doubles. And now, thanks to a generous match, your gift can be doubled as well. That means twice as many ultrasounds, twice as many lives saved, and twice as many mothers that are given hope. They also get diapers, car seats. They provide counseling to those mothers and care for up to two years.

I honestly am wondering how it would actually work if you were trafficking weapons and you're trafficking drugs and you're doing this. Obviously, our CIA has been engaged in trafficking. I mean, you could almost argue that that's what they were put together to do the deep state. How does that work? Like, would you then have random military planes that are coming in and following people? my imagination would be that probably the opportunity always exists when there's a really big event, right? ^t-00-23-05

The Super Bowl would be a great event. The opportunity for people to traffic. And companies that have a lot of events probably provide a pretty sound opportunity for people who are interested in those sorts of things to do that. I'm thinking about that now a lot.

There is like a thousand .30-06s out there and that's one reason why I wasn't ready to just jump in doubting the story right away because we don't even know what kind of ammo was used. It could literally be anything. So the first one we have is the 180 grain full metal jacket ball round. This is one of the most common .30-06s out there. This and the 150 grain. If you go to a gun shop and just ask for .30-06 ammo, this is probably what they'll give you. If I had to guess, I would honestly say he probably used something like this just because it is the most common round out there. The second one that we have is a lot more interesting. This is the 150 grain Hornady Ballistic Tip. ^t-00-30-58

Okay this is how we're going to set this one up. I have our ballistic dummy bust on a table in the front. I do have it slightly angled so we can hit the target that we're aiming for. Behind it I have three five gallon water jugs just in case the bullet over penetrates. Maybe we'll get lucky and actually capture it. What I'm going to do is pull my truck back here and try to use the roof to get a slight downward angle on the target just like it was in real life. Unfortunately for this video I'm not going to be able to take the shot at 140 yards. I got too many cameras to operate. I did do that in our first video though if you want to see it I'll link it right here. I just wanted to show you how easy it was and how close that actually is with this caliber.

Obviously, that channel is dedicated to it. And just so you understand and really appreciate what the federal government is trying to sell to you right now. That's what we mean when we say That particular bullet would have decapitated Charlie like you see like actually just the idea that that just like ricocheted and went inward is just so beyond ridiculous it's insulting and they think that if they send out these like glee boys like. <span id="ent-person-nick-fuentes-t-00-33-36"><a href="/entities/person-nick-fuentes.md">Nick Fuentes</a></span> acting, you know, someone who looks like he's never even been traversed into nature before.

It's just never going to happen. And so at some point they are going to either just, I don't know, have to declare war on the American people. Like nevermind, nevermind. We're just gonna go to war with you because you won't accept it. or they're gonna have to give us something that's truthful. Somebody is going to have to come forward and say something that makes sense. And because I believe that this conspiracy is so far reaching, because I believe it is exactly like the JFK assassination and people close to Charlie are aware of things that they sold him out in many ways every single day that goes by where they don't tell us the truth and they're not honest about the anxiety that Charlie had the night before he died.

I truly believe that the deep state is involved in this assassination and multiple states are involved. They don't know what to do. I think they've completely come undone because they believed that with enough money and power, they would get away with it. But at the end of the day, common sense seems to be ruling the roost. We're going to take another break before I get to some of your questions. All right, you guys, here is how it works. You actually have two ages, your actual age and then your body's internal biological age.

Imagine putting those two payments instead in your pocket and finally getting a little bit of breathing room ahead of the holidays. Well, that is possible if you call American financing today. If you're feeling stretched by everyday expenses, groceries, gas bills, everything piling up, you should know that you're not alone because most Americans are putting these expenses on credit cards and credit card rates are insane. in the 20s or even the 30s.
