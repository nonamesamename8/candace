I am here. And I gotta tell you, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> discussing the <span id="ent-event-jfk-assassination-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/event-jfk-assassination.md">JFK assassination</a></span>, that sure is something. If you haven't yet seen this clip that's making the rounds, we have it for you. And it makes it kind of hilarious, even more hilarious that the very organization that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a><span id="event-event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> built is trying to sell to the public that the very idea of a government sanctioned assassination is crazy. And on that point, another interesting lead has come in regarding the potential <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> connection, regarding which I should mention that <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash</a></span> has been directly asked about their potential involvement in <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s assassination. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-00-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=43" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And his answer, his reply to that question is stunning. I should say actually it's a non-answer. So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. What do you guys think <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> would have said about his own assassination? Just think about that. What would his perspective have been on everything that we are currently being told, people that are being attacked about it? ^t-00-00-43

Kennedy</a></span>'s assassination down in <span id="ent-gpe-dallas-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-dallas.md">Dallas</a></span>.

**🎤 Charlie Kirk**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-01-46.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:46</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=106" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Charlie Kirk:** In the <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span> files, <span id="ent-org-mossad-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/org-mossad.md">Mossad</a></span> is mentioned. One of the reasons why <a href="/entities/org-mossad.md">Mossad</a> is mentioned so much is that they're just a very good intelligence operation. It was not mentioned as if they were tied or that they knew about it or that they were involved. Again, I think the best reading of what happened there is who wanted <a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a> dead the most. Again, a lot of people said <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> wanted <a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a> dead.<span id="event-event-1963-11-22-jfk-assassination-t-00-01-46"><a href="/events/event-1963-11-22-jfk-assassination.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> I'd love to hear that argument. But definitely, <a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">Lyndon Baines Johnson</a> and parts of our own government and the Cubans wanted him dead. And who actually made it happen? There were like 15 or 20 things that happened that day that were inexcusable. They changed the parade route. He rode in an open air convertible. <span id="ent-person-lyndon-baines-johnson-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">LBJ</a></span> decided not to ride alongside of him. The vehicle slowed down right when it went by the <span id="ent-gpe-texas-t-00-01-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-texas.md">Texas</a></span> schoolbook depository. A lot there, right? ^t-00-01-46

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-02-30.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:30</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=150" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Charlie Kirk:** And then, again, I think that all of us are smarter to believe that it was simply <span id="ent-person-lee-harvey-oswald-t-00-02-30"><a href="/entities/person-lee-harvey-oswald.md">Lee Harvey Oswald</a></span>. The more important question is not, oh, who did it? We have to first acknowledge it, that more than one person did it. Once we acknowledge that more than one person did it, then we can expose our government to have lied to us about the <span id="ent-event-jfk-assassination-t-00-02-30"><a href="/entities/event-jfk-assassination.md">JFK assassination</a></span>, which then I think will sober a lot of us about trusting the government in the future. I mean, yes, all of that. ^t-00-02-30

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-02-59.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:59</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=179" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Thank you, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-59"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>, for reminding us that you had common sense, that you didn't accept force-fed narratives, that you did not accept the BS crap that our government has sold us regarding the one individual that was involved in <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-02-59"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span>'s assassination. Of course, multiple people were involved and a lot of strange things occurred on that day. That is what makes his answer there so compelling, okay? Especially in the midst of, well, <span id="ent-concept-mkultra-t-00-02-59"><a href="/entities/concept-mkultra.md">MKUltra</a></span> 2.0. Remember the first government psyop on the people, <a href="/entities/concept-mkultra.md">MKUltra</a>, what actually came together, sorry, I should say <span id="ent-concept-operation-mockingbird-t-00-02-59"><a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingbird.md">Mockingbird</a></span> 2.0. ^t-00-02-59

And now it's being deployed again, <a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingbird.md">Mockingbird</a>, <span id="ent-concept-operation-mockingbird-t-00-03-34"><a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingbird.md">Operation Mockingbird</a></span> 2.0, to convince people that questions about the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-34"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> narrative are just crazy. How dare you consider that there may have been employees at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-03-34"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> who could be engaged in an obvious cover up at this moment? Well, <span id="ent-person-frank-turek-t-00-03-34"><a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank</a></span> says that's so crazy because that would mean that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> hired people that ultimately betrayed him. And no one's ever been betrayed by people that they trust in the history of the world. ^t-00-03-34

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-04-16.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:16</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=256" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, well, actually, maybe that did happen for <span id="ent-person-jesus-christ-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/person-jesus-christ.md">Jesus Christ</a></span>. That's just one historical example of a person surrounded by somebody that they trust who would ultimately betray them. And yes, <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span>, who personally selected <span id="ent-person-lyndon-baines-johnson-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">Lyndon Baines Johnson</a></span> to be his <span id="ent-org-vice-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/org-vice.md">vice</a></span> president, <a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">Lyndon Baines Johnson</a>, who was clearly implicated in <a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a>'s assassination. <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> rightfully says that, that that is obvious by now. So yeah, it's all very plausible. Oh, and <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, you can see, does not readily dismiss the idea that the <span id="ent-org-mossad-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/org-mossad.md">Mossad</a></span> may have been involved. He says he'd like to hear more of an argument on that. ^t-00-04-16

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-04-59.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:59</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=299" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** as he asserts that definitively parts of our government had to have been involved. And he says, the Cubans, the commies wanted him dead. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> is encouraging the inquiry further. Who wanted <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-04-59"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span> dead the most? Well, we should continue down that path. Who wanted <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-59"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> dead the most and why? And <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was very much in the political fast lane. And in the political fast lane, they want you dead for really one or all of these three reasons, money, secrets, and or power. We know that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> said no to money right before he died. ^t-00-04-59

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Kmt6HgRjckU/t-00-05-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmt6HgRjckU&t=343" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I think that means he probably knew a secret right before he died. And there is no doubt that his youth political organization had achieved a considerable amount of political power. Could there have been global implications? Of course, people are laughing, they've been laughing this entire time, because just following the evidence of what transpired on that day, a lot of odd things that transpired on that day, just like on the day of <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-05-43"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span>'s assassination, well, that pointed us into the direction of a particular satellite of countries and continents that have somehow come up in this investigation.

Yes, we have mentioned <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-06-27"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>.

Wow, that seems crazy. People also laughed when I said that there was thereafter a viable threat, which came from the Macron couple who apparently paid for my assassination.
