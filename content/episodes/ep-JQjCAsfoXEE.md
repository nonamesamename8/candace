Happy Monday. A little bit of history for you today. It was after the public execution of sitting President <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span> in 1963 that the <span id="ent-org-central-intelligence-agency-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-central-intelligence-agency.md">CIA</a></span> established <span id="ent-concept-operation-mockingbird-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingbird.md">Operation Mockingbird</a></span>. Deep state assassinations require deep state solutions<span id="event-event-1963-11-22-jfk-assassination-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-1963-11-22-jfk-assassination.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>. They spent an offensive amount of money to control the<span id="event-event-1963-01-01-cia-establishes-operation-mockingbird-to-control-m-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-1963-01-01-cia-establishes-operation-mockingbird-to-control-m.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> press and to control the narrative to put an end to the public asking common sense questions about what actually transpired on that fateful day in <span id="ent-gpe-dallas-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-dallas.md">Dallas</a></span>. To put it simply, the deep state declared a psychological warfare campaign on the people. In effect, their soldiers were the journalists and the writers. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-00-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=41" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Their goal, obviously, to get people to just stop asking questions, to almost criminalize asking questions via methods of gaslighting. Fast forward to <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span>, and they're running the exact same playbook. <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was assassinated in broad daylight, and they immediately deployed their troops to criminalize asking questions. What are you supposed to take from everyone? You know what I mean? I think the implication was dramatic. And I think a lot of people reading the tweets would assume that she meant <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span>. Either <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a> is evil and was in on it, or <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> is an evil c—. I think that what <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> is doing right now is evil. It is evil, what she's doing right now. ^t-00-00-41

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-01-24.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:24</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=84" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So close, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-24"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. There was so much unity, so much excitement, so much resurgence in faith and newfound interest in faith, and now there is <span id="ent-org-discord-t-00-01-24"><a href="/entities/org-discord.md">discord</a></span>, so many distractions, and that is just like Satan who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. He is called the Great Accuser. He is the sower of <a href="/entities/org-discord.md">discord</a>, the author of confusion. The reason I haven't weighed in on things is I am an eyewitness to events, and they said, "Don't comment on things because anything you say can mess that up." I don't want to mess up any trial for the person who did this. Well, events is a thousand percent right. But <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-01-24"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> is well within her rights to suggest certain things and all this, and she has the right to free speech and all that. That's fine. She's right to ask questions. I just think it is hurtful and not helpful when you cross a line to strongly suggest somebody's guilty of something for which you have no evidence. Challenge accepted, <span id="ent-person-frank-turek-t-00-01-24"><a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank Turek</a></span>. Let's go, Max, today. ^t-00-01-24

Pastor <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-02-06"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>—let's not forget him too—because he's the spawn of naval psychological intelligence, psychological campaigns upon the public.

**🎤 Pastor Rob McCoy**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-02-35.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=155" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Pastor Rob McCoy:** I want to read you a passage out of Romans. It says in Romans 12:15 and 16, "Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion." I think that's a fitting verse. I mean, we're hearing all kinds of speculation about <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-35"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and what he believed and didn't believe. And I just have to tell you, this is not the time for it. It's a time to minister to the family. They have a husband and a father to bury. We have a friend to bury, a brother to bury, a son to bury. And the world is mourning. And this is not the time to get clicks. ^t-00-02-35

It's time to just simply weep with those who weep. And it's time to just humble yourself and not make it all about you. It's about the Lord. ^t-00-03-17

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-03-32.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:32</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=212" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** You hear that, <span id="ent-concept-christians-t-00-03-32"><a href="/entities/concept-christians.md">Christians</a></span>? Asking questions is just—it's not about you. I mean, is there anything that they didn't try? You're making money off of this. It's unbiblical. <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-32"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> wouldn't want this. His family is grieving. Not right now. Let's at least wait a couple of weeks. It's going to ruin the case. You'll get into heaven as long as you don't think about it. If you don't think about what happened on 9/10, then you're guaranteed a slot into heaven. You know, I used to really lament the fact that I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. Seriously, I hated that I didn't grow up rich. Who didn't, right? Who does not hate—if you grow up without a lot—that you didn't just, that you weren't just born into the right circumstances? And now I reflect on those feelings, and I wouldn't change a single thing. I am actually so grateful. That's what I want to say today. ^t-00-03-32

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-04-16.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:16</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=256" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I am so grateful about where I started my life in St. John's Towers. I look at that building now; it's such pride. And I am grateful to have not grown up with a silver spoon in my mouth because it fortified my character, and it gave me a lot of common sense, basic survival skills. It requires gut instinct. And I had to learn at a very young age to read people. I think that's my superpower, actually—just being able to look at someone and sense danger or sense deceit. I can just look at Rob (Pastor <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>). And for me, it's a no. It's obviously a no. Same thing, by the way, I should mention with <span id="ent-person-steven-crowder-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/person-steven-crowder.md">Steven Crowder</a></span>. I have never been a fan. He just always gave me the energy of a pathological liar. I trust my gut. I don't trust influencer campaigns. ^t-00-04-16

And they tell me that I should roll up my sleeves and get a vaccine. I don't listen to any of that. I trust my gut instincts, always. And my gut started to tell me that they suddenly began panicking when I discovered the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-05-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> planes. They did what we now term a pre-bunking, right? A pre-bunking is when you say something casual, and then they send out like a full fleet<a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-egyptian-plane-su-bnd-transponds-at-provo-fbo-unti.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2025-09-10-egyptian-plane-su-bnd-transponds-at-provo-fbo-unti-t-00-05-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-egyptian-plane-su-bnd-transponds-at-provo-fbo-unti.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> against you to not even actually debunk you, but they're just so extreme in not debunking you that they even lie about what you said. And that lie tends to actually foreshadow something that they don't want you to know. So I'll give you a perfect example. ^t-00-05-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-05-44.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:44</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=344" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** On October 11th, when I infamously tweeted about the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-05-44"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> military plane that left <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-05-44"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> on the morning of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-44"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination, I got the time zone wrong by a couple of hours. And they completely overreacted. I mean, an account that didn't even exist wrote, "Oh, the time zone is wrong." Next thing you know, it was trending. And they pretended it had been officially debunked just because the departure time was wrong. But that wasn't even enough for them. They were so alarmed, and I wasn't—I was off air at that time, right? I took a two-week break. They still found something to scandalize when I wasn't even on air, something that I didn't even say. ^t-00-05-44

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-06-23.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=383" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** They sent undercover operatives to sign up for my private <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-06-23"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span> that I have on Tuesdays. And then they took a clip of that <a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a> from that <a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a> and accused me of accusing <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> of murdering her husband. I mean, they manufactured that claim out of thin air, and then they made it go viral. They sent it out to all the right people: <span id="ent-person-steven-crowder-t-00-06-23"><a href="/entities/person-steven-crowder.md">Steven Crowder</a></span>, right? Everyone suddenly making videos saying that because I said he was betrayed by everyone, obviously what I meant was <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-06-23"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> murdered her husband. And this was all happening because I mentioned the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-06-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> plane. I am certain of it. And so that you can look backward and really see how these psychological campaigns work, ^t-00-06-23

And I think it is a circumstance where we all just know. We just know that he was truly betrayed in one of the most egregious ways that I think I've ever seen. It has made me lose faith in politics. It has made me fully lose faith in <span id="ent-person-donald-trump-t-00-07-47"><a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Trump</a></span>. My heart aches for the fact that he gave so much of his life to <a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Trump</a> and to politics. And they just were like, "Nope, that is it."

Those were talking points that were delivered to them. They were supposed to go out of the gate with that. The question is why, okay? Retrospectively, that was a clue. They were panicking. They were trying to pretend—me saying that everyone betrayed him, which obviously was not about <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> (Kirk). It also wasn't about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s mother or <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s father or <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s children—but they were specifically trying to struggle session that into a slight against <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> rather than more obviously suggesting that people at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-10-24"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> betrayed him, which <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a> was not an employee of leading up to his death.

Now, I'm going to let you guys know right now that it is difficult to investigate a matter—especially when it involves a person that you know—because there are minor things that I immediately noticed that were off or unlikely that would not have necessarily alarmed the general public. For example, one of the earliest alarms that went off for me was the fact that <span id="ent-person-terrell-farnsworth-t-00-11-52"><a href="/entities/person-terrell-farnsworth.md">Terrell Farnsworth</a></span>, the guy who takes out the SD cards, was there at all.

So he just out of the blue was at this event, and then he wasn't, and he secured the SD cards. Okay, it was something that I noticed that the rest of the world would not have taken as a concrete fact. It is also how I felt—and I'm sharing this with you now for a reason—when I learned that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> flew into <span id="ent-gpe-salt-lake-city-t-00-12-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-salt-lake-city.md">Salt Lake City</a></span> that morning. Because why didn't he fly into the much closer <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-12-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> airport?

Because he would only do it, actually, if there was A, a big donor on the hook—and maybe that's what he was told: "This guy's gonna give a ton of money to <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-13-16"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>"—or B, because it was a major political person.

But essentially, all the flight radar websites only show when the plane is actually in the air.

So this website, <span id="ent-org-ads-b-exchange-t-00-20-19"><a href="/entities/org-ads-b-exchange.md">ADS-B Exchange</a></span>, takes that raw data.

Another possibility is that a military jet—particularly one from a foreign country—would likely be equipped with encrypted satellite-based communications capabilities.

I no longer water down what I believe to be palatable. Silence is not kindness. Silence is consent.

And let's be honest: when you've got a big and busy family, slowing down is not always an option. It takes me literally five seconds in the morning, and I feel a difference all day long. The best seller that they have is Dose for Your Liver, which was formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion, and maintain your body's filter. Dose's clinical results showed lowering liver enzyme levels by 50% in most of their participants. One shot of Dose for Your Liver is equivalent to 17 shots of turmeric juice. Dose is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, and vegan. Stick with Dose, and you will feel the incredible benefits over time: more energy, better digestion, reduced bloating, healthier liver enzyme function, reduction in brain fog, and better sleep. ^t-00-31-00

And <span id="ent-person-alex-clark-t-00-35-34"><a href="/entities/person-alex-clark.md">Alex Clark</a></span> said, "Oh, every year since I've been here, this is what we do." And the guy starts this video by being like, "You have to be an idiot to accept that as an answer," of course, doing an audit has nothing to do with internally establishing a <a href="/entities/concept-doge.md">DOGE</a>, right? He recognized that something was wrong at the organization. And as I told you—okay, because I do not miss on these things—he was not just concerned about where the money was going; he was concerned about where it was coming from. ^t-00-35-34

If it had his attention, he would have figured it out by sundown. What did <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> discover? Is my question, okay? Now, to correct something that he says there: he says four months before—that's the regular tax deadline. It is actually normal for big companies to file for a tax extension, but they missed that deadline as well. I think that was October 15th was the tax extension deadline. They have missed them both.

So this is unusual that they've left off three of them. And I'm going to let him get into a deeper clip here where he discusses the quote-unquote missing $8.6 million. Take a listen. Let us look at the one financial statement we do have for fiscal year <span id="ent-date-2024-t-00-37-02"><a href="/entities/date-2024.md">2024</a></span> for <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a>.

They are sending it to their own shell company. Now this is not necessarily illegal, except for the fact that the financial statement for the other organization is missing. We cannot see how this $8.6 million is being spent. This is very important because there are strange variances around this money.

This dip happens because in prior years they were sending money to <span id="ent-org-turning-point-endowment-t-00-38-23"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-endowment.md">Turning Point Endowment</a></span>. They were transferring millions of dollars. This stopped in 2021, and they started ramping up sending money to <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-38-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>'s <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-38-23"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span>. Let's break this down. First of all, I find it really unethical that they were sending millions of dollars to their own endowment. I know that a lot of nonprofits do this, but I think it is unethical. Do the donors know this is how <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> is spending their money? ^t-00-38-23

In my opinion, they should be spending donations on operating their nonprofit, not on buying investments. As of fiscal year <span id="ent-date-2023-t-00-39-04"><a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a></span>, they had $61 million of assets in the endowment, which was generating $1.9 million a year of investment income. Personally, I think that's an unethical way to run a nonprofit, but that's just my opinion. But what is important here is what happened to the missing $8.6 million—the amount sent to <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-39-04"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>'s <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> in fiscal year <span id="ent-date-2024-t-00-39-04"><a href="/entities/date-2024.md">2024</a></span>. ^t-00-39-04

If we look at the prior year, the majority of the money was spent on other salaries and wages. How is this possible when <a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a>'s <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> reports zero employees? Does anyone else think that sounds a little suspicious? In my opinion, what I think is happening is I think there are fake people on the payroll.

It's possible, okay? Like I said, probably a low probability, but it is plausible that they did that. But it is just a fact that they missed the filing extension deadline. So what's going on here? Where did the $8.6 million go? And what's also compelling about this video—which we didn't show—is that he clarifies that <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-43-13"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> actually decreased their staff—the 501(c)(3) arm—by 33%. ^t-00-43-13

Yeah, they are definitely running an operation on X. It's obviously military bots. Like I said, they boost if I make one mistake. It's like a trending topic for three days, and then when I drop truth, they're like, "She's never dropped one fact," and I'm like, "We have so many times." It's like crazy to say that we have not dropped any facts. Okay, that's like so beyond insane to try to suggest that we have not dropped facts when we have been the ones breaking virtually every story on this. And of course, credit to all the other people on X who have been doing the same thing.

But I will respect them in one regard: they knew that the first thing they had to do was—when I was in my grief stage—was to try to pretend I didn't even have a relationship because they knew that I would be the one.
