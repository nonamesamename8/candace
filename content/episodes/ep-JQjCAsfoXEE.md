**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** All right, you guys. Happy Monday. A little bit of history for you today. It was after the public execution of sitting President JFK in 1963 that the CIA established Operation Mockingbird. Deep state assassinations require deep state solutions. They spent an offensive amount of money to control the press and to control the narrative to put an end to the public asking common sense questions about what actually transpired on that fateful day in Dallas. To put it simply, the deep state declared a psychological warfare campaign on the people. In effect, their soldiers were the journalists and the writers. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=41" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-00-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Their goal, obviously, to get people to just stop asking questions, to almost criminalize asking questions via methods of gaslighting. Fast forward to 2025, and they're running the exact same playbook. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated in broad daylight, and they immediately deployed their troops to criminalize asking questions. What are you supposed to take from everyone? You know what I mean? I think the implication was dramatic. And I think a lot of people reading the tweets would assume that she meant Erika Kirk. Either Erika Kirk is evil and was in on it, or Candace (Candace Owens) is an evil c—. I think that what Candace (Candace Owens) is doing right now is evil. It is evil, what she's doing right now. ^t-00-00-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=84" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-01-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So close, Charlie (Charlie Kirk). There was so much unity, so much excitement, so much resurgence in faith and newfound interest in faith, and now there is discord, so many distractions, and that is just like Satan who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. He is called the Great Accuser. He is the sower of discord, the author of confusion. The reason I haven't weighed in on things is I am an eyewitness to events, and they said, "Don't comment on things because anything you say can mess that up." I don't want to mess up any trial for the person who did this. Well, events is a thousand percent right. But Candace (Candace Owens) is well within her rights to suggest certain things and all this, and she has the right to free speech and all that. That's fine. She's right to ask questions. I just think it is hurtful and not helpful when you cross a line to strongly suggest somebody's guilty of something for which you have no evidence. Challenge accepted, Frank Turek. Let's go, Max, today. ^t-00-01-24

Pastor Rob McCoy—let's not forget him too—because he's the spawn of naval psychological intelligence, psychological campaigns upon the public. And here's what he has to say about matters. Take a listen. (Clip: Pastor Rob McCoy) ^t-00-02-06

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=155" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-02-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** I want to read you a passage out of Romans. It says in Romans 12:15 and 16, "Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion." I think that's a fitting verse. I mean, we're hearing all kinds of speculation about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and what he believed and didn't believe. And I just have to tell you, this is not the time for it. It's a time to minister to the family. They have a husband and a father to bury. We have a friend to bury, a brother to bury, a son to bury. And the world is mourning. And this is not the time to get clicks. ^t-00-02-35

It's time to just simply weep with those who weep. And it's time to just humble yourself and not make it all about you. It's about the Lord. ^t-00-03-17

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=212" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-03-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** You hear that, Christians? Asking questions is just—it's not about you. I mean, is there anything that they didn't try? You're making money off of this. It's unbiblical. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wouldn't want this. His family is grieving. Not right now. Let's at least wait a couple of weeks. It's going to ruin the case. You'll get into heaven as long as you don't think about it. If you don't think about what happened on 9/10, then you're guaranteed a slot into heaven. You know, I used to really lament the fact that I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks. Seriously, I hated that I didn't grow up rich. Who didn't, right? Who does not hate—if you grow up without a lot—that you didn't just, that you weren't just born into the right circumstances? And now I reflect on those feelings, and I wouldn't change a single thing. I am actually so grateful. That's what I want to say today. ^t-00-03-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=256" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-04-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I am so grateful about where I started my life in St. John's Towers. I look at that building now; it's such pride. And I am grateful to have not grown up with a silver spoon in my mouth because it fortified my character, and it gave me a lot of common sense, basic survival skills. It requires gut instinct. And I had to learn at a very young age to read people. I think that's my superpower, actually—just being able to look at someone and sense danger or sense deceit. I can just look at Rob (Pastor Rob McCoy). And for me, it's a no. It's obviously a no. Same thing, by the way, I should mention with Steven Crowder. I have never been a fan. He just always gave me the energy of a pathological liar. I trust my gut. I don't trust influencer campaigns. ^t-00-04-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=300" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-05-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I don't trust celebrities because they're raising their arms and they glitter and shine. And they tell me that I should roll up my sleeves and get a vaccine. I don't listen to any of that. I trust my gut instincts, always. And my gut started to tell me that they suddenly began panicking when I discovered the Egyptian planes. They did what we now term a pre-bunking, right? A pre-bunking is when you say something casual, and then they send out like a full fleet against you to not even actually debunk you, but they're just so extreme in not debunking you that they even lie about what you said. And that lie tends to actually foreshadow something that they don't want you to know. So I'll give you a perfect example. ^t-00-05-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=344" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-05-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** On October 11th, when I infamously tweeted about the Egyptian military plane that left Provo on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, I got the time zone wrong by a couple of hours. And they completely overreacted. I mean, an account that didn't even exist wrote, "Oh, the time zone is wrong." Next thing you know, it was trending. And they pretended it had been officially debunked just because the departure time was wrong. But that wasn't even enough for them. They were so alarmed, and I wasn't—I was off air at that time, right? I took a two-week break. They still found something to scandalize when I wasn't even on air, something that I didn't even say. ^t-00-05-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=383" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-06-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** They sent undercover operatives to sign up for my private book club that I have on Tuesdays. And then they took a clip of that book club from that book club and accused me of accusing Erika of murdering her husband. I mean, they manufactured that claim out of thin air, and then they made it go viral. They sent it out to all the right people: Steven Crowder, right? Everyone suddenly making videos saying that because I said he was betrayed by everyone, obviously what I meant was Erika Kirk murdered her husband. And this was all happening because I mentioned the Egyptian plane. I am certain of it. And so that you can look backward and really see how these psychological campaigns work, ^t-00-06-23

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=427" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-07-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I want you to watch this clip of Steven Crowder (Clip: Steven Crowder) trying to convince people that despite the words that are coming out of my mouth, they shouldn't listen to what I'm saying. He actually knows what I really meant, which is something that I didn't say. And yeah, here it is. Here's that clip. ^t-00-07-07

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=444" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-07-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** But you watch this clip in its entirety, and it seems pretty blatant that she's saying—and people are interpreting it this way, which is also important—that the Trump (Donald Trump) administration, not whatever it was... We went from underground Jew tunnels, Mossad. The Trump (Donald Trump) administration killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-07-24

**🎤 SPEAKER_4**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=467" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-07-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** I just really needed to just take a breather and really process everything that happened with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and what it kind of means in terms of where we are. And I think it is a circumstance where we all just know. We just know that he was truly betrayed in one of the most egregious ways that I think I've ever seen. It has made me lose faith in politics. It has made me fully lose faith in Trump (Donald Trump). My heart aches for the fact that he gave so much of his life to Trump (Donald Trump) and to politics. And they just were like, "Nope, that is it." It serves us, or it doesn't serve us, and we want to move on. And so here's a holiday, bro. ^t-00-07-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=510" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-08-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** If they try to give me a holiday, what is with them giving people a holiday after they kill them? Why is that a thing? You know what I mean? Like, oh, Martin Luther King—what about this holiday? What about this boulevard? Anyways, let me knock out—like, they're gonna give Charlie (Charlie Kirk) a boulevard. They already did. They did in Israel. They gave him a freaking boulevard. It's like, as soon as they give you a boulevard and a holiday, they definitely killed you. Okay, there's no question. They killed you. There's no way. That's like their signature thing. It's like that's what they do. It's their signature. They sign off after they murder you. They're like, "Holiday and a boulevard." And it's never on the nice side of town either. Like Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Boulevard is not gonna be on the nice side of town. Anyways, I will be back on the 27th, you guys. Thank you guys for all the support throughout these couple of weeks, these last really kind of six weeks since Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died. ^t-00-08-30

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=558" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-09-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** Well, let me first be tactful here and tell you that outrageous claims—and this is an outrageous claim—require outrageous evidence. Of course, as is par for the course, none has been presented. You know who's really close to President Trump (Donald Trump)? And you know who people are now saying stood to gain? Well, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s wife, Erika Kirk, who has now been put—Candace (Candace Owens) with that language, with this accusation—has put the wife of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and she'll say, "That's not what I tried to do." It is. It's the result. Erika Kirk in the crosshairs. ^t-00-09-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=600" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-10-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** There's no middle ground here right now. Either Erika Kirk is evil and was in on it, or Candace (Candace Owens) is an evil... ^t-00-10-00

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=624" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-10-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** No matter how many times I watched that clip of me talking about Martin Luther King Boulevard and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Boulevard, I do not get from that that Erika Kirk killed her husband, but that's what they went with. Those were talking points that were delivered to them. They were supposed to go out of the gate with that. The question is why, okay? Retrospectively, that was a clue. They were panicking. They were trying to pretend—me saying that everyone betrayed him, which obviously was not about Erika (Kirk). It also wasn't about Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s mother or Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s father or Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s children—but they were specifically trying to struggle session that into a slight against Erika rather than more obviously suggesting that people at Turning Point USA betrayed him, which Erika Kirk was not an employee of leading up to his death. Why were they doing that? Then, of course, that made me only look further into the Egyptian planes, and I discovered that the planes had been tracking Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-10-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=667" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-11-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** We showed you guys this, right? We created this document, and we organized it to SU-BND being the blue plane and then tail number SU-BTT being the yellow plane. That seems to have struck even more fear into the nest of mockingbirds. In fact, they sent Mother Mockingbird out—Ben Shapiro—to make the exact same wild allegation out of thin air that I said something specifically about Erika when I had not. Again, I'll ask the question: why Erika? Why didn't Ben on stage say, "She accused Mikey or Rob (Pastor Rob McCoy)"? I've done multiple episodes now on Mikey, on Rob (Pastor Rob McCoy), speaking about Andrew Kolvet, Alex Clark. Why were they kept? Why do they keep going back to Erika? ^t-00-11-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=712" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-11-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** What is it about these Egyptian planes that were making them spiral? Now, I'm going to let you guys know right now that it is difficult to investigate a matter—especially when it involves a person that you know—because there are minor things that I immediately noticed that were off or unlikely that would not have necessarily alarmed the general public. For example, one of the earliest alarms that went off for me was the fact that Terrell Farnsworth, the guy who takes out the SD cards, was there at all. Okay, Terrell does not do college campus events. He doesn't do that. He's at the top of the company. He does the big events: the SAS, the AmFest. He does not do college events. But of course, he told me they were trying something new that day. ^t-00-11-52

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=753" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-12-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And it must've been so new that it was over by the next event after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died because he wasn't there again. So he just out of the blue was at this event, and then he wasn't, and he secured the SD cards. Okay, it was something that I noticed that the rest of the world would not have taken as a concrete fact. It is also how I felt—and I'm sharing this with you now for a reason—when I learned that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) flew into Salt Lake City that morning. Because why didn't he fly into the much closer Provo airport? Now, ostensibly, the answer is because he had an interview with a person that nobody really knows. He's a managing director of a restaurant fund. ^t-00-12-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=796" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-13-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Andrew K. Smith out of nowhere does this "Restaurantology" interview with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and so Charlie (Charlie Kirk) flew into Salt Lake to make this interview happen. That to me felt like an oddity. Okay, because in a typical scenario, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is not going to be incentivized to go out of his way. Because he would only do it, actually, if there was A, a big donor on the hook—and maybe that's what he was told: "This guy's gonna give a ton of money to Turning Point USA"—or B, because it was a major political person. Otherwise, for the sake of a podcast, people travel to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), okay? If you want to get Charlie (Charlie Kirk), you're gonna travel to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to make that happen. He's not gonna go out of his way. To me, the common thing that always happened was they would set up an interview in an empty room at the campus. ^t-00-13-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=839" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-13-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** At UVU campus, they would have had this guy in the corner, and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have flown into Provo. So I felt—again, didn't share it at this time—that they diverted Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to Salt Lake City for a reason. Something else you should know about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was obsessed with planes. My husband and him actually shared this in common, where every time we'd board a plane, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would know exactly—like, way too many facts about the plane. If we boarded an old American Airlines flight, he'd be like, "Oh, they actually took these planes out of service in the 1970s." He just had a lot of Snapple facts when it came to planes—something that I just do not dedicate any of my time to learning about. He really liked planes and knowing everything about them. And more crucially, I want you guys to understand this: Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had a photographic memory. He did. ^t-00-13-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=884" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-14-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Donor names, emails, numbers. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a walking Excel sheet. You'd walk into a room; he'd say, "That so-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so, so-and-so. He works for so-and-so; she works for so-and-so. They gave this much last year." That is why he was able to turn Turning Point USA into a successful machine because of his memory. It was unbelievable. That's all gonna be relevant now, okay? So you have to remember that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) landed into Salt Lake City at 9:23 a.m. local time. I suspect that if he had instead landed into Provo, he would have recognized the blue Egyptian plane, okay? It's not every day that you see an Egyptian military craft. ^t-00-14-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=927" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-15-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** It is now my well-informed opinion that he would have looked at that plane; he would have recognized the blue plane, and he would have instantly realized that something was amiss. And now I'm going to explain to you very carefully why I suspect that it is highly likely that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have recognized that plane, okay? Tail number SU-BND, the blue plane. A pregnant mommy sleuth who was locked into this investigation discovered something that me and my team had missed. I consider her—obviously and all of you—to be my decentralized intelligence agents. Anyway, she sent me a rather urgent email, and I'm obviously protecting her identity for reasons that are clear, but I want you to know that this discovery is due entirely to her. ^t-00-15-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=972" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-16-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** She is the person that in this regard went max for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) when I missed something. Her email stated, in effect, that I was only partially right about the plane tracking Charlie (Charlie Kirk); that she had done an additional 15 hours of research and was able to discern that the person the planes were actually tracking for years was Erika. Not Charlie (Charlie Kirk), but Erika was the one being tracked by these planes. And indeed, it turns out that she was correct. She discovered that between 2022 and September of 2025, both of those aircraft—SU-BTT, the yellow plane, and SU-BND, the blue plane—showed 68 overlaps with Erika's documented locations, okay? ^t-00-16-12

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=1017" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-16-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** 68 overlaps. I have since been able to add now 73 times that this overlapped, okay? And 29 of those instances also happened to include Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was also present. And that's what I was stumbling upon when I was looking into this. I was like, "Why is this plane where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is?" The flights were majority clustered within five states: Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Delaware, and Utah. And it's a pattern that she believes is statistically not random. I'm telling you, this information has been completely verified. ^t-00-16-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=1052" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-17-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I am showing you this on a spreadsheet now. These are all the instances in which this plane—all 68 instances that this plane crossed with Erika. And I'm also gonna say this includes overseas as well. So my instant question becomes: why didn't Turning Point acknowledge that this plane was familiar to them? When I was taking all of these figurative online bullets, someone could have easily said something, right? That's kind of a repeat thing in this investigation. Josh Hammer lies; I get attacked. Turning Point just stays silent. They know he's lying, but they allow the lie to flow. Alex Clark lies; I get attacked. ^t-00-17-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=1093" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-18-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm telling the truth. Turning Point knows it, but they kind of allow this like Catholic thing—lie to flow. And the influencers are allowed to lie. Nobody at Turning Point ever just steps to clarify that I'm on to something or I'm telling the truth about something. And when it comes to these Egyptian flights, the math on this is indisputable. There is less than a 0.00000001 percent probability—okay, under random distribution models—that these Egyptian planes coincidentally landed around Erika at these times. ^t-00-18-13

I flagged this because I was alarmed because I thought it was tracking Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I am telling you that this plane—in addition to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and primarily actually—was tracking Erika. Now, let's get to the day of the assassination. On the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, we know the yellow plane took off in the morning, but the blue plane did not take off in the morning. The blue plane, SU-BND, did, however, power on. And I want to be very clear as to what I mean when I say that this plane was on. I am saying that it was transponding, okay? It's transponding at the FBO at Duncan Aviation, a private terminal. ^t-00-18-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=1177" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-19-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So at the very least, they powered up the electronics. At most, they fully powered it on, and the engine was running. What we know for certain is that it did not move from the FBO. Did not move. It was just on and transponding. And I want you to recognize—I'm going to make it clear for you—what are the times that they were transponding? It's two times. I'm going to tell you those times. But first, I'm going to have Mark pull this up, and he can tell us what it is that we're looking at here and how we were able to find this information about the jet that was just sitting at the FBO. So it looks like, based on this information that I found—and I had to figure out how to use this website because my mother didn't take enough Tylenol when she was pregnant with me— ^t-00-19-37

But essentially, all the flight radar websites only show when the plane is actually in the air. But if the plane is on the ground and transmitting, that data from the ADS-B transponder still goes out. So this website, ADS-B Exchange, takes that raw data. And so I was able to find it on September 10th. If you look on the very left of the frame, it shows September 10th. And it looks like there's just one data point. But what I did is I zoomed in, and the plane's actually not moving. It's just GPS is a little bit inaccurate when you're this close, but you're able to see all these different times here. And that is the UTC time zone, also known as Zulu time. ^t-00-20-19

And so I tracked all these down, and I was able to find that the plane was transponding from 9:05 a.m. until 10:34 a.m. Then it was off. And then at 12:40 p.m., it came back on and turned off again at 1:29 p.m. Okay, I'm gonna repeat that so that everybody understands. We were able to discern from this data as follows. ^t-00-21-01

Then the plane turned back on; the transponder was turned back on just 17 minutes after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot, at 12:40 p.m. and 53 seconds, and it stayed on until 1:29 p.m. and 40 seconds. So what was the blue plane doing sitting on the tarmac? We can only imagine what it was doing, okay? We can run a couple of options here. It's possible that they were just running a maintenance check. ^t-00-21-35

Another possibility is that a military jet—particularly one from a foreign country—would likely be equipped with encrypted satellite-based communications capabilities. If you wanted to make an untraceable phone call, as an example, that would be a good place to do so because only the NSA would be able to intercept that call. And it's pretty obvious that the deep state doesn't seem particularly interested in the assassination of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So that'd be a safe place to communicate on that plane. ^t-00-22-10

What we can do now, however, is we can add this to our list of verifiable Turning Point USA lies because I'm gonna count this as a lie by severe omission by keeping your mouth shut and allowing Candace (Candace Owens) to take all the figurative bullets as she points out the oddity of a plane that you guys recognized, okay? ^t-00-22-44

Turning Point USA is able to provide answers to these questions. There is more that I know, by the way, but I want to challenge them to respond to this first. Were these Egyptian military planes familiar to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? It is a simple yes or no question. And answer it carefully, please, Andrew Kolvet, spokesperson for Turning Point USA, because there was something very specific, Andrew, that you told me that happened when you arrived into Provo on the tarmac that day, and it is now playing over and over and over again in my mind, and it isn't adding up. ^t-00-23-29

Is that in the hospital on that day, you told me—you were in the hospital—that you were told that there was a credible threat against me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson). Specifically, you told me that me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) were on a list and that you were just telling me as a friend that me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) should lay low. And after you told me that, I ended our phone call, and I immediately called Tucker (Tucker Carlson). And I said—hey, terrified, obviously crying all day—and told him that he and I have to lay low because there's a credible threat. And it is now really living inside me that you did not tell me who that threat was from. I assumed the feds told you, but I asked you the question: why wouldn't the feds call me directly if there was a threat against my life? No such call has come in. ^t-00-24-14

How could someone have told you that there was a credible threat and that me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) should lay low, and yet me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) have since not been notified by any federal agency about those credible threats? Who do those threats come from? Because I gotta tell you, there are a lot of people making videos about me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson), and none of them are Egyptians, okay? In fact, it's the Israelis. It is Israel that seems deeply upset with me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson). They are not letting it go. ^t-00-24-54

So who specifically told you in the hospital room that there was a credible threat against my life? I'm gonna need that information, okay? I wanna know that now. Because the stakes seem pretty high. I have a lot of questions. This is probably a good time to tell you all that I am starting to piece together another scenario that could have happened.

I know something else about the Egyptian flights. This time, another mommy sleuth. I learned that oddly, Duncan Aviation—you know, where that plane was transponding from, the FBO in Provo—sourced rental cars for these quote-unquote Egyptians when they landed a couple of days before this operation.

All right, you guys. Too many people have been vilified for standing up for the truth. Obviously, so many people have felt the sting of injustice, but also a lot of people right now are feeling courage. I'm definitely done playing defense. I no longer water down what I believe to be palatable. Silence is not kindness. Silence is consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds the topic of the lives that are lost before they even take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like it. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love for just $28. That's what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion.

We have to stand for truth and what's right. And we have to save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also gonna tell you guys about Dose because I think we all know that the modern-day diet is taking a toll on Americans.

And let's be honest: when you've got a big and busy family, slowing down is not always an option. It takes me literally five seconds in the morning, and I feel a difference all day long. The best seller that they have is Dose for Your Liver, which was formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion, and maintain your body's filter. Dose's clinical results showed lowering liver enzyme levels by 50% in most of their participants. One shot of Dose for Your Liver is equivalent to 17 shots of turmeric juice. Dose is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, and vegan. Stick with Dose, and you will feel the incredible benefits over time: more energy, better digestion, reduced bloating, healthier liver enzyme function, reduction in brain fog, and better sleep. ^t-00-31-00

These contain their annual financial statements. When you look at the forms, there are some very strange anomalies. Several of the 990 forms are missing. Turning Point USA lists four related entities. There is Turning Point USA, Turning Point Endowment, Turning Point Action, and America's Turning Point. All different organizations do slightly different things. The Form 990 for fiscal year 2024 is posted for Turning Point USA, but it is missing for all the other three organizations. ^t-00-34-07

This is a massive red flag. So Tyler Bowyer is being snarky on X.com and telling people to go look at the annual financial audit, but the financial audit is missing from last year for three of the four organizations. This strange decision to hide their financial statements happened four months before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was murdered. I will repeat for clarity. Someone at Turning Point decided not to file three of the four of their annual financial statements four months before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) appointed a new COO, requested a new audit, and was murdered. ^t-00-34-50

So to be clear, that was another point that they gaslit me on when I told you that it was unusual that seven days before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, he said that he wanted to establish DOGE, right? Tyler came out and lied, and he said, "This is just totally regular." And Alex Clark said, "Oh, every year since I've been here, this is what we do." And the guy starts this video by being like, "You have to be an idiot to accept that as an answer," of course, doing an audit has nothing to do with internally establishing a DOGE, right? He recognized that something was wrong at the organization. And as I told you—okay, because I do not miss on these things—he was not just concerned about where the money was going; he was concerned about where it was coming from. ^t-00-35-34

And he decided that he wanted to figure something out, he would have figured that ish out by sundown. Okay, that is how brilliant he was. If it had his attention, he would have figured it out by sundown. What did Charlie (Charlie Kirk) discover? Is my question, okay? Now, to correct something that he says there: he says four months before—that's the regular tax deadline. It is actually normal for big companies to file for a tax extension, but they missed that deadline as well. I think that was October 15th was the tax extension deadline. They have missed them both. And that is completely abnormal. And he is correct. ^t-00-36-17

So this is unusual that they've left off three of them. And I'm going to let him get into a deeper clip here where he discusses the quote-unquote missing $8.6 million. Take a listen. Let us look at the one financial statement we do have for fiscal year 2024 for Turning Point USA. Schedule I shows grants and other assistance to organizations, governments, and individuals in the United States. This schedule shows you where Turning Point is sending its money. ^t-00-37-02

They are sending it to their own shell company. Now this is not necessarily illegal, except for the fact that the financial statement for the other organization is missing. We cannot see how this $8.6 million is being spent. This is very important because there are strange variances around this money. I have pulled the last five years of 990 forms for Turning Point USA. Here is a table with contributions compared with the largest expense, which are the grants from Schedule I. ^t-00-37-40

This dip happens because in prior years they were sending money to Turning Point Endowment. They were transferring millions of dollars. This stopped in 2021, and they started ramping up sending money to America's Turning Point. Let's break this down. First of all, I find it really unethical that they were sending millions of dollars to their own endowment. I know that a lot of nonprofits do this, but I think it is unethical. Do the donors know this is how Turning Point is spending their money? ^t-00-38-23

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=2344" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:39:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-39-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_5:** Turning Point USA is taking in donations and then sending the money to their endowment to invest in the stock market. In my opinion, they should be spending donations on operating their nonprofit, not on buying investments. As of fiscal year 2023, they had $61 million of assets in the endowment, which was generating $1.9 million a year of investment income. Personally, I think that's an unethical way to run a nonprofit, but that's just my opinion. But what is important here is what happened to the missing $8.6 million—the amount sent to America's Turning Point in fiscal year 2024. ^t-00-39-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=2386" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:39:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-39-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_5:** The amount of money sent to America's Turning Point was getting larger and larger, and because the financial statements are missing, we cannot tell how this money was spent. If we look at the prior year, the majority of the money was spent on other salaries and wages. How is this possible when America's Turning Point reports zero employees? Does anyone else think that sounds a little suspicious? In my opinion, what I think is happening is I think there are fake people on the payroll. I think that paychecks are getting sent to people who do not really exist. And that would explain why we have a company with zero employees with millions of dollars of salary expense. ^t-00-39-46

Do they think we are this soft and persuadable? Like, do we look like the kinds of people that are just gonna watch an assassination in broad daylight and just let it go because some influencers insist that we do? No, sorry. It's not 1963. You're not gonna get away with it this time. ^t-00-40-32

I'll let him take it away. What about Tyler Bowyer's argument that they have an annual financial audit every year? If what I am saying is true, why wouldn't their annual audit catch these issues? The annual financial audit for Turning Point USA, Inc. and its affiliates was performed by an accounting firm called Baker Tilly. In the notes, they explain that they audited Turning Point USA, Turning Point Action, Turning Point Endowment, America's Turning Point, and TPUSA Merch. That usually means they audited all the shell companies when they provided their opinion that the statements present fairly in all material respects. ^t-00-41-13

I wonder if Baker Tilly will provide an explanation why they can issue a flawless audit report when three 990 forms were never filed with the IRS. And just to clarify, Baker Tilly's audit opinion letter is signed after Turning Point missed the filing date with the IRS, so there is no excuse for Baker Tilly not to mention this in their audit opinion. Erika Kirk assumed the role of CEO of Turning Point USA on September 18, 2025—eight days after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was murdered. She has been the CEO for almost two months. ^t-00-41-57

If someone has lied on the 990 form, people go to jail for that. I want some explanation of why Turning Point USA sent $8.6 million to their shell company and then did not file financial statements. And Erika, I don't know who does the accounting at Turning Point, but if they have not been telling you about any of this, you need to fire your accountants immediately. ^t-00-42-41

And again, just to modify: it is possible that when they use that outside auditor, they showed them all the documentation, and then they gave them a clean bill of health, and then for whatever reason, Turning Point decided not to file. It's possible, okay? Like I said, probably a low probability, but it is plausible that they did that. But it is just a fact that they missed the filing extension deadline. So what's going on here? Where did the $8.6 million go? And what's also compelling about this video—which we didn't show—is that he clarifies that Turning Point USA actually decreased their staff—the 501(c)(3) arm—by 33%. ^t-00-43-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQjCAsfoXEE&t=2632" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:43:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-JQjCAsfoXEE/t-00-43-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So there was a 33% staff reduction, and yet the cost of salaries somehow went up. And to him, that looks suspicious. And I agree; that looks suspicious, right? And this, of course, is the kind of pressure that needs to be put on them. Yes, I said it was a very bad idea—right off the bat— for Erika, who's grieving her husband, to then instantly become a chairman and a CEO because these are valid questions now that people are asking, and a chairman and a CEO is going to have to respond to those questions. You have to answer these questions when people are asking about money—especially given the fact that so many people—I mean, they cleared over $70 million in the first couple of weeks after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. ^t-00-43-52

That is not okay. We deserve answers to the questions that we are asking, and we're going to keep asking them. Okay, we're going to keep asking them because I know there are snakes at Turning Point USA, and I'm going to reveal more to you guys tomorrow. First, take a quick break, and we'll be back with some comments and answers to your questions. All right, you guys. In all the time that I've been endorsing my wireless company, PureTalk, I have never seen an offer like this. ^t-00-44-36

If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. Well, the rates dropping now is the perfect time to pay off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They are saving people just like you an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in low fives—which is a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, which will give you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before we know it. So don't wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today. ^t-00-45-59

Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or visit americanfinancing.net/Owens. That's americanfinancing.net/Owens. Okay, I got a text from one of my friends that says slight detail, but in September, don't forget there was a daylight saving time switch. So to calculate the time that we said on Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, it was UTC minus six, not minus seven. So for those times, you're going to adjust them one hour forward—just to make that clear—because that will be the headline on X. "She didn't calculate that right. It's a different hour because of daylight saving time." Okay, I gotta get into a couple of things. ^t-00-46-44

And this proves more that Rob (Pastor Rob McCoy) was lying about this so-called blood all over him because we were thinking maybe it happened at the hospital. So where did this so-called blood come from? That was apparently all over Mikey because it wasn't when he got shot, and it wasn't at the hospital. The channel it's on is the Coach Collins channel, who has been doing some really great content daily on Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Okay. I will say I did not vet that information—obviously, we no matter what pull the top comment from a previous episode. I did see something going around on TikTok, and I can try to reach out to that person. But it's an eyewitness account—until we have actual proof. It's basically their word versus his word. ^t-00-48-07

They want to make you feel dumb, stupid, and ugly for thinking. And you have to find within yourself the confidence to keep going, right? Because you are watching how they tried—it was so sinister, the way they have been attacking me from the second that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got shot and trying to make us think that we're crazy for recognizing that everything is wrong about this day. That's a psychological campaign. That is what the war is nowadays. And I want to just encourage all the YouTubers and all the mommy sleuths. This is Project Mommy Sleuth, really: ^t-00-48-50

One day at a time, we are getting somewhere. Okay, what else do we have? We have a comment from the Paleo Rider, right? Hi, Candace (Candace Owens). I know you are on the right track. I've been watching daily, and I was active on X. Well, until I called out Israeli propaganda, and then I was permanently suspended.

Yeah, they are definitely running an operation on X. It's obviously military bots. Like I said, they boost if I make one mistake. It's like a trending topic for three days, and then when I drop truth, they're like, "She's never dropped one fact," and I'm like, "We have so many times." It's like crazy to say that we have not dropped any facts. Okay, that's like so beyond insane to try to suggest that we have not dropped facts when we have been the ones breaking virtually every story on this. And of course, credit to all the other people on X who have been doing the same thing.

It literally makes me sick. I just—the nerve of these people, the things that they did. But I will respect them in one regard: they knew that the first thing they had to do was—when I was in my grief stage—was to try to pretend I didn't even have a relationship because they knew that I would be the one.
