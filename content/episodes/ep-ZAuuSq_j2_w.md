Happy Thursday. Fun little update for you. When the clock struck midnight last night and Cinderella's carriage turned back into a pumpkin, <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> decided it was a good time to issue a confirmation plus an ultimatum—a time and a date for our debate<span id="event-event-2025-08-15-cam-higby-hired-onto-turning-point-usa-payroll-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-15-cam-higby-hired-onto-turning-point-usa-payroll.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>.

They did not send me a text message. They did not coordinate anything with me. They simply made this midnight announcement and gave it a countdown: 24 hours to respond. So we're gonna discuss that. And let me just tell you, <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> is so done after this. You just cannot survive being this disingenuous.

That's just what <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> military planes do: fly around the skies in the middle of <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> when <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> is being assassinated. Well, it turns out maybe these planes might be the key to everything—not nothing. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. I feel like I have to ask this question on behalf of the entire world. What the hell is going on at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>? What's going on?

Who is making the decisions? Who is calling the shots on all of these terrible and extremely obvious PR moves? Just, I think we all deserve to at least know what's going on. It feels like this company is going to turn into <span id="ent-org-enron-t-00-01-28"><a href="/entities/org-enron.md">Enron</a></span>. All right. Amazing. And then just plummet overnight. I just have the lack of transparency and also, ironically, the transparency of the things that they are doing. You can't make this up. They are just so obvious—so obviously trying to hide something. ^t-00-01-28

Okay, right. Don't laugh.

Yeah, this is <a href="/entities/person-cam-higby.md">Cam Higby</a>. Take a listen.

That is an interesting question. Not that I'm aware of, but you know, interesting question. I can try to find out and maybe let you know. I think that might be more of a law enforcement matter though. ^t-00-02-46

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-03-07.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:07</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=187" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I brought that up because it was just so propagandist—so in our faces. I obviously did not think that this was going to lead back to <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-03-07"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, but little did I know that we can add <span id="ent-person-cam-higby-t-00-03-07"><a href="/entities/person-cam-higby.md">Cam Higby</a></span> onto our list of brand-new. You know, everyone was just so brand-new on that day. Everyone was so brand-new leading up to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-07"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination. Well, <a href="/entities/person-cam-higby.md">Cam Higby</a> is on the payroll of <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a>, beginning in August of this year<span id="event-event-2024-08-01-cam-higby-began-employment-at-turning-po-t-00-03-07"><a href="/events/event-2024-08-01-cam-higby-began-employment-at-turning-po.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>. So in theory, <a href="/entities/person-cam-higby.md">Cam Higby</a>—who was laughing off the idea of an assassination attempt—is being paid by the very organization that just had its leader assassinated in broad daylight in front of the entire world. I find that to be interesting. Who directed him to ask that question? ^t-00-03-07

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-03-51.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:51</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=231" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm just asking questions. But first, after my episode yesterday, I expected—call me crazy— I expected that <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> would reach out to me via text, via email; that they would instantly follow up with their long diatribe and be sincere and say, "Okay, here are some dates and some times. When would you like to make this happen? We're going to have this great debate." Rather, instead of hearing anything from <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a>, I heard from <span id="ent-person-skylar-t-00-03-51"><a href="/entities/person-skylar.md">Skylar</a></span>, my executive producer, this morning via text—which I'm going to show you—that I was somehow already nine hours into a 24-hour countdown that was issued by <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-03-51"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. Here is that text exchange with <a href="/entities/person-skylar.md">Skylar</a> this morning. ^t-00-03-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-04-36.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:36</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=276" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He, at 8:49, said, "I'm sure you saw this." And I responded to him and I said, "No, actually I didn't see this." And I opened the tweets, which went out from <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-04-36"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span> around midnight last night. And here's what he wrote. I'm like, how am I supposed to see this? "The livestream we announced on the show Wednesday has been set." That would imply to the audiences that they reached out to me and we set a time. No. He goes on. "At 4 p.m. Eastern, 2 p.m. local time on Monday, <span id="ent-date-december-15th-t-00-04-36"><a href="/entities/date-december-15th.md">December 15th</a></span>, a collection of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-36"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s friends will respond to statements made by <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-04-36"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span> to set the record straight once and for all." "Prior to the opening of <span id="ent-event-america-fest-t-00-04-36"><a href="/entities/event-america-fest.md">AmericaFest</a></span>." ^t-00-04-36

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-05-21.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:21</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=321" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, if it's gonna be once and for all, it sounds pretty final. I mean, I would assume that I would have to contribute so that I could answer back, right? He goes on to write, "We'll be live-streaming, as we said from the beginning. This is going to be a live-streamed event from <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-21"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s <span id="ent-gpe-phoenix-t-00-05-21"><a href="/entities/gpe-phoenix.md">Phoenix</a></span> Studio. Our offer from yesterday holds. If <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-05-21"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> wishes to join us in person in <a href="/entities/gpe-phoenix.md">Phoenix</a>, she is welcome to do so. She can let us know by the end of today." Why? Well, I'm sorry. If you're saying this is happening on the 15th, why am I getting 24 hours to be able to respond to you? That doesn't make any sense. That, for some reason, feels like this is a BS offer and a really cheap PR move. There's no reason to issue a 24-hour response and to put this up in the middle of the night. ^t-00-05-21

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-06-04.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:04</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=364" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** A. There's no reason you didn't reach out to me and say, "Hey, does this work? Can I check some flights? See if I can get in there." Nope. This is it. They put this up there on the 15th. The last week of our show is live. Obviously leading up to Christmas—that's the last week of our show. Obviously it's a pretty busy week. So I'm like, okay, caught off guard by this, but you know what? I sense this is a PR move. So let me say, you've already said it's live-streamed. If an event is live-streamed, of course we can make it work anyplace. I mean, at any time, any day—we can make this happen, right? Because... You're live-streaming it. There's no reason I can't show up electronically. Okay. ^t-00-06-04

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-06-44.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:44</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=404" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I respond to him and I say, "This is kind of weird how you didn't email or call me to ask about times or availability and instead chose to tweet this confirmation out at midnight. Why am I learning about this on X? <span id="ent-date-december-15th-t-00-06-44"><a href="/entities/date-december-15th.md">December 15th</a></span> does not work in person, and 2 p.m. happens to also be the literal time that I do my podcast live every day, which you knew. But we will happily cancel the daily podcast, and we'll join you guys virtually instead for the live stream on the 15th. If that works on your end, let's lock it in?" Okay, we're jumping here. Let's make it happen, okay? That's the beauty of the industry. That is the beauty of <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-06-44"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span>. You can literally be any place, any time. Just send me a link, right? Any place, any time—we can join you virtually. ^t-00-06-44

So they have the tech capability to do this. We have the tech ability to do this. Let's make this sincere and do this for people around the world who do not feel that you guys have been honest and forthcoming in terms of answers that you could obviously supply regarding <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-26"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination. Well, if we needed any more evidence that nothing that they do is genuine and that this was an obvious planned PR move, here is what <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-07-26"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake</a></span> tweeted out just now before we went live on the show. ^t-00-07-26

We have decided that that response will be delivered during a live stream"—as he said, a live stream—"on <span id="ent-date-december-15th-t-00-08-05"><a href="/entities/date-december-15th.md">December 15th</a></span>. Thank you for your response, letting us know that you will not be joining the in-person conversation. We will be proceeding without you." Why are you proceeding without me? To have a conversation that is about me? Why am I getting 24 hours to respond? Why do you need me there in person? If you are trying to be sincere and answer the very many questions that I have brought up on this show, you guys weren't even sincere in what you said yesterday. ^t-00-08-05

So we're supposed to trust that you guys are gonna handle this discussion all by yourselves and respond to any and every allegation? And this isn't just some planned PR for "once and for all"? Like I said, this is so obvious. He is being completely destroyed in the comments because what's happening at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-08-48"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span>—and I've seen this happen before—is they now believe that they are smarter than their audience, right?

But it has to be physically—she needs to be in person"—even though we have shown that we have people join us not in person, and it's live-streamed, and we both have the tech abilities to do that. If she doesn't make this work within 24 hours, we can now say that it's on <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-09-27"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. This is a disaster, okay? It is a dumpster fire. That's the only way to describe what is happening at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-09-27"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> today. And right now it is a dumpster fire. Everyone can read this for what it is. As I said, they are getting destroyed in the comments. Like really, guys—really? You're not gonna just send us a simple live-stream link and let us join you? We've had people on this show live-streamed. We could have them tomorrow. ^t-00-09-27

I also attached to that tweet: "Any day leading up to the 15th. We can do this virtually any place and any time." But no—they need to have it in person in <span id="ent-gpe-phoenix-t-00-10-11"><a href="/entities/gpe-phoenix.md">Phoenix</a></span> on <span id="ent-date-december-15th-t-00-10-11"><a href="/entities/date-december-15th.md">December 15th</a></span>, or they cannot have me at all. Is that passing the vibe check for you guys? Or does it seem like more posturing and more of a way for them to simply be in the room with themselves as they all lie—without any person in the room to be able to fact-check those lies, who have researched those lies, and who have kept a list regarding the very many lies they are telling, okay?

Dose is a powerful all-in-one wellness shot that helps support gut health, immunity, energy, and all the stuff that really matters when you don't have time to slow down. And let's be honest: when you have a big and busy family, slowing down is not always an option. It takes me literally five seconds in the morning, and I feel the difference all day long. Their best seller is Dose for Your Liver. It was formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion, and maintain your body's filter. Dose's clinical results showed lowering liver enzyme levels by 50% in most of their participants. One shot of Dose for Your Liver is equivalent to 17 shots of turmeric juice. Dose is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, and it's vegan. ^t-00-21-55

I agree. And it's like, guys—we can see the influence campaign too. So please just stop doing it. Like stop paying the influencers because it's a waste of your money beyond anything else. Like they don't look cool. It's like not Regina George in Mean Girls. Like—"Ah, don't laugh. You can't sit with us." We're the cool guys. It's so silly.

The reality is: you got to start in your home, right? There's just—it was a matrix. Take your kids out of school. That's the first thing I say. It made me so happy last night when I went to an event and just ran into this woman who said, "We took my kids out of school, and I heard your podcast, and we couldn't do it, and we were tired, and I have a job, and he has a job, and we just did it. We made it work." And that's what I did. I just did it. And I realized if my sister—older sister—was making it work and getting up at 4 a.m. in the morning—at 3:45— I think she wakes up every day to be able to keep her full-time job plus homeschool her kids. But also when I saw the joy that returned to her life, I was like, "What is my excuse?" Am I tired? ^t-00-49-20

Am I exhausted today? Yes—today in particular after going to an evening event last night. Yeah, I was. I woke up in bed. I was like, "I could just sleep for one more hour, please." But the reward and the joy of it has returned to my life and knowing that I'm doing what I can in my own capacity to collapse the system—great. Stop taking their pills, right? That's another part. The <span id="ent-concept-big-pharma-t-00-50-05"><a href="/entities/concept-big-pharma.md">pharmaceutical complex</a></span>—learn about that. Stop offering your children's bodies to the state.

It'll be shocking for you. Gift that to a friend. Like I said, that came from the left. The left was on it with <a href="/entities/concept-big-pharma.md">Big Pharma</a> long before the right was in on it. Something else you can do is stop signing up your sons for war, right?
