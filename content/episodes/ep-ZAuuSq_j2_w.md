**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. Happy Thursday. Fun little update for you. When the clock struck midnight last night and Cinderella's carriage turned back into a pumpkin, Turning Point USA decided it was a good time to issue a confirmation plus an ultimatum—a time and a date for our debate. I should tell you that they did not send me an email. They did not send me a text message. They did not coordinate anything with me. They simply made this midnight announcement and gave it a countdown: 24 hours to respond. So we're gonna discuss that. And let me just tell you, Turning Point is so done after this. You just cannot survive being this disingenuous. We also are going to get back into the Egyptian planes today. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=43" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-00-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** They are also working very hard to try to convince us that that was nothing. That's just what Egyptian military planes do: fly around the skies in the middle of Provo when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is being assassinated. Well, it turns out maybe these planes might be the key to everything—not nothing. Welcome back to Candace. I feel like I have to ask this question on behalf of the entire world. What the hell is going on at Turning Point USA? What's going on? I wanna know what is happening over there in Arizona. ^t-00-00-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=88" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-01-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Who is in charge exactly? Who is making the decisions? Who is calling the shots on all of these terrible and extremely obvious PR moves? Just, I think we all deserve to at least know what's going on. It feels like this company is going to turn into Enron. All right. Amazing. And then just plummet overnight. I just have the lack of transparency and also, ironically, the transparency of the things that they are doing. You can't make this up. They are just so obvious—so obviously trying to hide something. ^t-00-01-28

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=131" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-02-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Before we get into their frankly bizarre late-night tweets and ultimatum, I wanted to update you guys and let you know that Cam Higby—remember that weird propagandist reporter who goes to the Pentagon press secretary and is like, "Don't laugh." Okay, right. Don't laugh. And then proceeds to ask if they heard about France's assassination attempt on my life, which I also said that France was on the ground the day—on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. Yeah, this is Cam Higby. Take a listen. (Clip: Cam Higby speaking to the Pentagon press secretary) ^t-00-02-11

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=161" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-02-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Yeah, so this is my first question, and don't laugh. ^t-00-02-41

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=166" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-02-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** Does the DoW have any evidence at all of a French military plot to assassinate Candace Owens? That is an interesting question. Not that I'm aware of, but you know, interesting question. I can try to find out and maybe let you know. I think that might be more of a law enforcement matter though. ^t-00-02-46

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=187" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-03-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So I brought that up because it was just so propagandist—so in our faces. I obviously did not think that this was going to lead back to Turning Point USA, but little did I know that we can add Cam Higby onto our list of brand-new. You know, everyone was just so brand-new on that day. Everyone was so brand-new leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Well, Cam Higby is on the payroll of Turning Point USA, beginning in August of this year. So in theory, Cam Higby—who was laughing off the idea of an assassination attempt—is being paid by the very organization that just had its leader assassinated in broad daylight in front of the entire world. I find that to be interesting. Who directed him to ask that question? ^t-00-03-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=231" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-03-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I'm just asking questions. But first, after my episode yesterday, I expected—call me crazy— I expected that Turning Point would reach out to me via text, via email; that they would instantly follow up with their long diatribe and be sincere and say, "Okay, here are some dates and some times. When would you like to make this happen? We're going to have this great debate." Rather, instead of hearing anything from Turning Point, I heard from Skylar, my executive producer, this morning via text—which I'm going to show you—that I was somehow already nine hours into a 24-hour countdown that was issued by Turning Point USA. Here is that text exchange with Skylar this morning. ^t-00-03-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=276" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-04-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He, at 8:49, said, "I'm sure you saw this." And I responded to him and I said, "No, actually I didn't see this." And I opened the tweets, which went out from Blake Neff around midnight last night. And here's what he wrote. I'm like, how am I supposed to see this? "The livestream we announced on the show Wednesday has been set." That would imply to the audiences that they reached out to me and we set a time. No. He goes on. "At 4 p.m. Eastern, 2 p.m. local time on Monday, December 15th, a collection of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s friends will respond to statements made by Candace Owens to set the record straight once and for all." "Prior to the opening of AmericaFest." ^t-00-04-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=321" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-05-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, if it's gonna be once and for all, it sounds pretty final. I mean, I would assume that I would have to contribute so that I could answer back, right? He goes on to write, "We'll be live-streaming, as we said from the beginning. This is going to be a live-streamed event from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s Phoenix Studio. Our offer from yesterday holds. If Candace wishes to join us in person in Phoenix, she is welcome to do so. She can let us know by the end of today." Why? Well, I'm sorry. If you're saying this is happening on the 15th, why am I getting 24 hours to be able to respond to you? That doesn't make any sense. That, for some reason, feels like this is a BS offer and a really cheap PR move. There's no reason to issue a 24-hour response and to put this up in the middle of the night. ^t-00-05-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=364" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-06-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** A. There's no reason you didn't reach out to me and say, "Hey, does this work? Can I check some flights? See if I can get in there." Nope. This is it. They put this up there on the 15th. The last week of our show is live. Obviously leading up to Christmas—that's the last week of our show. Obviously it's a pretty busy week. So I'm like, okay, caught off guard by this, but you know what? I sense this is a PR move. So let me say, you've already said it's live-streamed. If an event is live-streamed, of course we can make it work anyplace. I mean, at any time, any day—we can make this happen, right? Because... You're live-streaming it. There's no reason I can't show up electronically. Okay. ^t-00-06-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=404" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-06-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I respond to him and I say, "This is kind of weird how you didn't email or call me to ask about times or availability and instead chose to tweet this confirmation out at midnight. Why am I learning about this on X? December 15th does not work in person, and 2 p.m. happens to also be the literal time that I do my podcast live every day, which you knew. But we will happily cancel the daily podcast, and we'll join you guys virtually instead for the live stream on the 15th. If that works on your end, let's lock it in?" Okay, we're jumping here. Let's make it happen, okay? That's the beauty of the industry. That is the beauty of 2025. You can literally be any place, any time. Just send me a link, right? Any place, any time—we can join you virtually. ^t-00-06-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=446" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-07-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** In fact, today on their show, they had Andrew Colvett joining them virtually. So they have the tech capability to do this. We have the tech ability to do this. Let's make this sincere and do this for people around the world who do not feel that you guys have been honest and forthcoming in terms of answers that you could obviously supply regarding Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Well, if we needed any more evidence that nothing that they do is genuine and that this was an obvious planned PR move, here is what Blake tweeted out just now before we went live on the show. ^t-00-07-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=485" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-08-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "Yesterday, we made it clear that we would be scheduling a formal response to allegations and accusations that you have made. We have decided that that response will be delivered during a live stream"—as he said, a live stream—"on December 15th. Thank you for your response, letting us know that you will not be joining the in-person conversation. We will be proceeding without you." Why are you proceeding without me? To have a conversation that is about me? Why am I getting 24 hours to respond? Why do you need me there in person? If you are trying to be sincere and answer the very many questions that I have brought up on this show, you guys weren't even sincere in what you said yesterday. ^t-00-08-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=528" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-08-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You told some glaring lies about things that I have said. So we're supposed to trust that you guys are gonna handle this discussion all by yourselves and respond to any and every allegation? And this isn't just some planned PR for "once and for all"? Like I said, this is so obvious. He is being completely destroyed in the comments because what's happening at Turning Point—and I've seen this happen before—is they now believe that they are smarter than their audience, right? They think they are smarter than their small-pocket donors. They can pull such an obviously crappy public move like this and pretend, "Well, we tried. We tried. ^t-00-08-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=567" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-09-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You know, she said she could make it work, and we tried. But it has to be physically—she needs to be in person"—even though we have shown that we have people join us not in person, and it's live-streamed, and we both have the tech abilities to do that. If she doesn't make this work within 24 hours, we can now say that it's on Candace. This is a disaster, okay? It is a dumpster fire. That's the only way to describe what is happening at Turning Point USA today. And right now it is a dumpster fire. Everyone can read this for what it is. As I said, they are getting destroyed in the comments. Like really, guys—really? You're not gonna just send us a simple live-stream link and let us join you? We've had people on this show live-streamed. We could have them tomorrow. ^t-00-09-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=611" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-10-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I said, in response, I said to them, "I'll make this work." I also attached to that tweet: "Any day leading up to the 15th. We can do this virtually any place and any time." But no—they need to have it in person in Phoenix on December 15th, or they cannot have me at all. Is that passing the vibe check for you guys? Or does it seem like more posturing and more of a way for them to simply be in the room with themselves as they all lie—without any person in the room to be able to fact-check those lies, who have researched those lies, and who have kept a list regarding the very many lies they are telling, okay? I maintain that Turning Point is engaged in a cover-up. That is how I feel. Okay. ^t-00-10-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=653" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-10-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And like I said, it pains me to say that because this was once a bright spot in the conservative movement. It is no longer. They are using left-wing tactics, calling us names rather than answering our questions. It's everything Charlie (Charlie Kirk) stood against, okay? You don't need to call somebody a racist because they're asking questions about what happened with George Floyd leading up to his death, okay? That is a way that you skip over having to debate logically: you name-call. All Blake Neff did was name-call yesterday. All the pastors have been doing. It's demonic. It's possessed. It's evil. How about you simply answer the questions and stop behaving like you're a radical leftist? ^t-00-10-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=698" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-11-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Everyone can see what you're doing. That's what I want you guys to know. It's very clear, okay? I'm not asking people to defend me. You are just genuinely this transparent. So I am sorry that I cannot arrive in person because it's our last week on air before the holidays. I am still very happy—and I will say it again—to make that date and time and place because I'm here, and we have the technological capabilities to make it work. We can move it around, and we can do it even at midnight. I will stay awake, and I will make that work for you at midnight—anytime. Just send me a link. ^t-00-11-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=741" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-12-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** In the meantime, we are just going to start investigating harder because you're not acting right, okay? You guys are not acting right, and you are not going to be able to get yourselves out of it by trying to be tricky like that. And like I said, the fact that you mentioned the Egyptian plane so many times yesterday without providing a valid answer or reason as to why we should just ignore military planes that are circulating that don't belong to our country—we're gonna stay focused on that. And guess what? We have some more explosive revelations, which lead to more questions—which should be answered. And by the way, Turning Point, you should be concerned about... ^t-00-12-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=784" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-13-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** How odd, guys, that they don't even—they're not concerned about the Egyptian planes. They don't even know how to feign concern. They don't even know how to sell to us—in their best acting—that they care about what transpired on that day. If you wanted to act like you cared, you would go, "Yeah, no, that is actually weird. I wonder what those planes are about." Instead, they're like, "Ha ha ha, Egyptian planes—what we've had to endure, this crazy talk about these Egyptian planes." You should be concerned. And I'm going to give more cause for concern, okay? Because as you guys will recall, two Egyptian planes—got it. ^t-00-13-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=824" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-13-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** For the sake of ease, we've labeled one blue: that's SUBND, which was the one that was transponding on the ground at Duncan Aviation on the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, but it did not go anywhere. And then of course, our now infamous yellow plane that carried on to Delaware—Wilmington, Delaware—that morning, and has seemingly panicked the world, right? I'm reminding you that that flight from Provo to Delaware on the yellow plane had only four people on board. Okay, so that plane pretty much emptied out and then had only four people, one of which was a foreign dignitary. Now, one of those individuals I can confirm ^t-00-13-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=865" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-14-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** was using the name—and when I say using the name, we are dealing with governments; we are dealing with power; and these people just print passports, okay?— These are obviously dead ends. But the name that one of those individuals was using is Walid Mahmood, okay? Walid Mahmood. So we now know that of the four people that flew to Delaware, someone flew using the name Walid Mahmood, okay? Here is where it's going to get interesting. And I don't know if we can show that name, Chris—if we have that—but we can spell that out for them. I don't know if we have a graphic for that, but here's where it gets interesting, okay? Walid Mahmood ^t-00-14-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=909" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-15-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** had been in Provo before, okay? Specifically, Walid Mahmood came to Provo on May 27th of this year. Walid Mahmood came in, and we can also confirm that if you look up the plane that he was on, there is no transponder data which reflects that trip. He was not on the yellow plane. This is what's very interesting. He was aboard another Egyptian military plane, and the tail number for that plane is SUBTU. We're gonna make that the purple plane, okay? Purple plane was not there on the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, but we now have a person that was on that purple plane ^t-00-15-09

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=951" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-15-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** at the end of May, and then he is going to be on that yellow plane again on the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination—both times in Provo. And we can drop that now into our timeline, okay? May 27th: SUBTU flies into Provo with Walid Mahmood aboard. Maybe it's a pilot. I don't know. Then we've got it departs on June 2nd, and it is not transponding, okay? So you cannot find a record of this on FlightRadar. Now, why is this compelling? Why is this especially compelling? ^t-00-15-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=987" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-16-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Because the purple plane, SUBTU—as has been recently discovered by the work of other people—was once upon a time flown with the president of Egypt aboard. And by "once upon a time," I mean back in 2023. This tweet came from Project Constitution. I'm going to read it in its entirety, okay? "Confirmed. Candace Owens just got vindicated again. The Egyptian government website confirms that Egyptian President el-Sisi flew on SUBTU. Remember when Candace Owens dropped that bombshell exposing that Egyptian presidential plane as the mystery bird tied to those shadowy flights? And just so you know, he's confusing BTT. He's talking about BTU. ^t-00-16-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=1032" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-17-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We were always talking about BTT. Well, official receipts just landed straight from the Egyptian presidency website that on April 3rd, 2023, President al-Sisi touched down in Riyadh aboard that same exact aircraft, tail number SU-BTU, for a high-level sit-down with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman." Okay? So BTU. And again, he's mixing it up with BTT, but we can now connect these two planes. Now, before you jump to conclusions and go, "Well, does this solve this? Does this mean that this was the Egyptian president on board?" No. ^t-00-17-12

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=1067" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-17-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We could actually officially rule out that it was President al-Sisi that was aboard the jet on September 10th because he was photographed at a meeting with the Prime Minister of Tunisia, Sarah Zafrani—and it was in Egypt. We can also rule him out as having been the individual that was in Provo back in May because he was again photographed multiple times throughout that week in Egypt, okay? What we can however deduce is that Walid Mahmoud is therefore not the president of Egypt, ^t-00-17-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=1101" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-18-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** but he is almost certainly well-acquainted with the president of Egypt because planes that fly presidents around—military planes—you're not gonna just let some random wealthy Egyptian aboard your jet, right? This person is going to be well-acquainted with the president of Egypt, okay? So who is Walid Mahmoud? Who is the person using the name Walid Mahmoud? That is the question that we are left with. Now, again, maybe Walid is the pilot. That could make sense. But what was he or she doing in Provo at the end of May and into early June? ^t-00-18-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAuuSq_j2_w&t=1146" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ZAuuSq_j2_w/t-00-19-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** These are questions—and honestly concerns—that shouldn't be expressed by me. It should be expressed by every single person at Turning Point USA who is interested in getting to the bottom of who assassinated Charlie (Charlie Kirk). It should be expressed by our government. It should be expressed by the Pentagon and their giggly press secretary and press members. We should be asking this question. Instead, we're just being gaslit.

This holiday season, express your love with a very special gift of premium steaks from Riverbend Ranch. Their holiday bundles are only available while supplies last, and they're going to go pretty fast. You can order your holiday gifts today at RiverbendRanch.com. If you haven't yet tried Riverbend Ranch steaks, it is time that you definitely did. I have never had a better steak in my entire life. For the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle that focus on flavor and tenderness. They only use the top one or two percent of the entire Angus population as their breeding stock, which produces beef that has much more flavor and tenderness than your average Angus beef. Each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. ^t-00-20-32

They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. The beef is processed right at the ranch in their award-winning USDA-inspected processing facility, so you avoid the costly middlemen because the beef is sent directly from their ranch to your home. And I love supporting American ranchers. Right now, when you order from RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code Candace, you'll get $20 off your first order. That's RiverbendRanch.com with promo code Candace. Also, I want to tell you guys about Dose because the modern-day diet is taking a toll on all Americans.

Dose is a powerful all-in-one wellness shot that helps support gut health, immunity, energy, and all the stuff that really matters when you don't have time to slow down. And let's be honest: when you have a big and busy family, slowing down is not always an option. It takes me literally five seconds in the morning, and I feel the difference all day long. Their best seller is Dose for Your Liver. It was formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion, and maintain your body's filter. Dose's clinical results showed lowering liver enzyme levels by 50% in most of their participants. One shot of Dose for Your Liver is equivalent to 17 shots of turmeric juice. Dose is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, and it's vegan. ^t-00-21-55

"We don't know what we know" in different colors—which is obviously Christmas around the corner. So that will be fun. I was going to sign some t-shirts, but honestly that was really hard. It's much harder than it sounds. It takes a lot of time to sign a t-shirt. And I'm reminding you guys: you can gift someone a membership to Club Candace and to our book club on the website now, which is new.

Yeah, I will say that was the—like—all—it was like the number one top 500 comments yesterday was "don't go to Turning Point USA, don't go to Turning Point USA." And I was actually willing to do that within reason—like, I mean, like, if we had a conversation and tried to plan it and book it. But I guess they never were being sincere, and I should have seen through that because why would they? They are very obviously not trying to open themselves up to any inspection from the public. They are working with the feds to kind of bury the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) story. And that, my friends, to me, represents an end of an era. ^t-00-38-42

He wanted it to be fresh. He didn't want to become the RNC. In fact, he wanted to take over for the RNC with youth and a commitment to truth. And unfortunately, I think now they're trying to turn the apparatus into the same stale—you know—buy your way into the presence of someone; you do me a favor. And it's sad. But I do think that there is goodness, and that goodness is coming from this tragedy. And that goodness is that a lot of people are waking up to how it works.

Obviously, these are Satan's children, and they work by making you feel fearful so you trade off, and you go, "Okay, well, I just want to have money and be comfortable in this life right now. And so I'm willing to let badness happen. And I guess my kids are just going to inherit that badness, and this world is going to be run by pedophiles." And we can't do that.

Listen: just us knowing what it is and just the fact that so many people are awake to the reality that the assassination attempt was real—and that if it wasn't, we should be hearing from proper channels, not Cam Higby giggling like a little schoolgirl on the payroll of Turning Point USA— that's good, guys.

Like—what? Huh? You're not going to make it to heaven if you side with the devil, and the devil is always lying and hiding and obscuring. The truth is free, man.

Everything does just genuinely feel so fake and gay and performative, and it's a show— the fake audience applause and fake laughter. And no—I just want to see that you guys cared about him.

The reality is: you got to start in your home, right? There's just—it was a matrix. Take your kids out of school. That's the first thing I say. It made me so happy last night when I went to an event and just ran into this woman who said, "We took my kids out of school, and I heard your podcast, and we couldn't do it, and we were tired, and I have a job, and he has a job, and we just did it. We made it work." And that's what I did. I just did it. And I realized if my sister—older sister—was making it work and getting up at 4 a.m. in the morning—at 3:45— I think she wakes up every day to be able to keep her full-time job plus homeschool her kids.

The pharmaceutical complex—learn about that. Stop offering your children's bodies to the state. You can do that in your own capacity. We have that series, A Shot in the Dark, available on CandaceOwens.com for a reason—for first-time parents. It will shock you. I guess not.

Let Tim Pool rant and scream and say, "Who's gonna fight our wars next week? Huh? What is she doing? Who's gonna fight our wars? Doesn't she care?" No, I don't. I don't care.
