Happy Thursday, everybody. And I'm serious. You should be happy, and you should be merry because the tapestry is unraveling, right? I mean, there has been an extremely carefully woven tapestry<span id="event-event-2025-10-01-us-government-votes-against-releasing-epstein-file-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-10-01-us-government-votes-against-releasing-epstein-file.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> of deception in all of our lives.

So today we are going to talk about the <a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a>, the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">Anti-Defamation League</a></span>, because suddenly <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash Patel</a></span> wants to distance the feds from them. I don't really think that's possible. And I'm wondering<span id="event-event-2025-10-01-adl-issues-statement-responding-to-fbi-s-decision-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-10-01-adl-issues-statement-responding-to-fbi-s-decision.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> why he chose yesterday to do that.

What she says is interesting. Also, what she does for a living is even more interesting. Our witness tree grows. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-42"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. Okay, I need you guys locked in because things are becoming increasingly interesting, okay? Yesterday, the FBI made a rather curious announcement.<span id="event-event-2025-10-01-fbi-sends-connecticut-field-office-to-investigate-t-00-00-42"><a href="/events/event-2025-10-01-fbi-sends-connecticut-field-office-to-investigate.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-00-42

You know what the <a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a> is? The <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-01-24"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">Anti-Defamation League</a></span>, and the reasons, well, because they had listed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-24"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and his organization, <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-01-24"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a></span>, to be extremist. Everybody's an extremist according to the <a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a>. But I want you guys to know that this is not a subtle announcement. We need to unpack this announcement. Because I don't care what side of the aisle that you are on, you need to understand that the <a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a> is not, nor has it ever been, what it purports to be, okay? Purports to be, oh, you know, we're just looking out for hate speech and extremism. No, no, no, no. ^t-00-01-24

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-t1YtLS1n8Vs/t-00-02-02.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:02</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YtLS1n8Vs&t=122" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The reality is the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-02-02"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span> was born out of a Jewish Freemason organization known as <span id="ent-org-b-nai-b-rith-t-00-02-02"><a href="/entities/org-b-nai-b-rith.md">B'nai B'rith</a></span>. Now, if you're on my <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-02-02"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>, you know this, but <span id="ent-person-sigmund-freud-t-00-02-02"><a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a></span> was a member of <a href="/entities/org-b-nai-b-rith.md">B'nai B'rith</a>. We're discussing; we're reading right now the book <span id="ent-work-the-assault-on-truth-t-00-02-02"><a href="/entities/work-the-assault-on-truth.md">The Assault on Truth</a></span>, and <a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a> is very relevant. You have to learn the history of <a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a>. He's in all of our schools, all of our universities, taught as a hero, the history of the psychoanalytic movement. Look, the reality is him and all of his homies were covering up for incestuous child abuse. That is a fact, okay? They can't wipe that stain away. Quite literally, the way that they did this was through the mechanism of gaslighting. ^t-00-02-02

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-t1YtLS1n8Vs/t-00-02-47.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:47</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YtLS1n8Vs&t=167" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That's what he is the father of. Public gaslighting, okay? That's what modern psychology is. They moved to instead diagnose people who were being abused, right? They were using their credentials—“I'm of this, I'm of that”—to make people, maybe the wider public, believe that their gaslighting was actually legitimate. That is what the book <span id="ent-work-the-assault-on-truth-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/work-the-assault-on-truth.md">The Assault on Truth</a></span> unpacks. It is therefore a must-read because you have to realize how horrific the crimes were that were being committed that they were covering for. So <span id="ent-person-sigmund-freud-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a></span> was in <span id="ent-org-b-nai-b-rith-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/org-b-nai-b-rith.md">B'nai B'rith</a></span>, and the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span> was born out of <a href="/entities/org-b-nai-b-rith.md">B'nai B'rith</a>. Why? Well, because they put the organization together to defend a pedophile and a murderer. His name is <span id="ent-person-leo-frank-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/person-leo-frank.md">Leo Frank</a></span>.<span id="event-event-2024-01-01-phil-lyman-runs-for-utah-governor-t-00-02-47"><a href="/events/event-2024-01-01-phil-lyman-runs-for-utah-governor.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><a href="/events/event-1913-01-01-leo-frank-convicted-of-murdering-and-raping-mary-p.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-1913-01-01-leo-frank-convicted-of-murdering-and-raping-mary-p-t-00-02-47"><a href="/events/event-1913-01-01-leo-frank-convicted-of-murdering-and-raping-mary-p.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-02-47

And <span id="ent-person-mary-phagan-t-00-03-31"><a href="/entities/person-mary-phagan.md">Mary Phagan</a></span> was a 13-year-old girl who worked at his pencil factory.

Okay. They still found <span id="ent-person-leo-frank-t-00-04-15"><a href="/entities/person-leo-frank.md">Leo Frank</a></span> guilty, and so much has been written to try to obscure this still. They are still trying to defend <a href="/entities/person-leo-frank.md">Leo Frank</a>. What happened then is that his buddies over at the Freemasonic Lodge, <span id="ent-org-b-nai-b-rith-t-00-04-15"><a href="/entities/org-b-nai-b-rith.md">B'nai B'rith</a></span>, assembled the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-04-15"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span> to gaslight the public. “No, <a href="/entities/person-leo-frank.md">Leo Frank</a> wasn't guilty.” “Look what happened after.” He was lynched for what he did to <span id="ent-person-mary-phagan-t-00-04-15"><a href="/entities/person-mary-phagan.md">Mary Phagan</a></span>. “He is actually a victim of antisemitism.” That's it. “He wasn't guilty.” “I'm sure maybe the black guy did it in <span id="ent-date-1913-t-00-04-15"><a href="/entities/date-1913.md">1913</a></span> <span id="ent-gpe-atlanta-t-00-04-15"><a href="/entities/gpe-atlanta.md">Atlanta</a></span>,” ^t-00-04-15

It's utterly demented. I will never let it stand. He killed <span id="ent-person-mary-phagan-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/person-mary-phagan.md">Mary Phagan</a></span>. He is still guilty of that crime, no matter how much the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span> tries to obscure that. And by the way, if you want to learn more, you should learn more about <a href="/entities/person-mary-phagan.md">Mary Phagan</a>'s murder. I can point you guys; there's a book called The Murder of Little <a href="/entities/person-mary-phagan.md">Mary Phagan</a>, and it is written by a relative of hers. And that relative's name is also <a href="/entities/person-mary-phagan.md">Mary Phagan</a>. You should read the details of what happened 100 years ago. You should read the facts around it. Read the case documents. ^t-00-04-56

Because so much has been written since to try to obscure those facts. So go to the family member as a source. Do that in your own spare time. In fact, maybe I should add it to the <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-05-39"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span> list anyways. The reason why I'm telling you that is because there is a crucial—it really is a very crucial—element of our history that you need to come to terms with, right? The modern media machine, all of these journalists who lie and gaslight—you're seeing it right now, what they're writing about me—it's insane. They are students of effectively the psychoanalytic community. “Let's gaslight and then we will diagnose.” Gaslight and diagnose. Seeing it happen in real time pertaining to the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-39"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> case.

The text messages I think were really what is going on. And now they're yelling at us for noticing. We are all being abused right now by the press, right? They're trying to spin it. “No, I can't believe people have questions.” “The conspiracies are so bad.” “These text messages were totally legit.” “Anybody who wants to investigate it further,” “crazy, oh, just totally crazy.” “We're all clinically insane.” “We should probably consult a physician.” “How dare we?” It's inappropriate. “<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-06-24"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, as they always say, she must be suffering from postpartum psychosis.” ^t-00-06-24

Diagnose it if you need to. Anyways, you guys, the time has come for us to wake up. Now it should unnerve you with that little bit of history that despite their well-documented founding, the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-07-04"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span> is so powerful an organization that they have been directing the FBI for years.

Now, I want you to know that I learned that recently, last year, that both the left and the right work with the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-07-42"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span>, okay? There was this lie that's told publicly. I believed it, that it's just the left. It's all left-leaning. No, no, no, no. They work with both the left and the right. The neocons on the right side work arm-in-arm with the <a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a> and feed them names, primarily of anyone, I should say, who is an enemy to the state of <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-07-42"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>. ^t-00-07-42

They're trying to save face, pretend that they're upset, you know? Like, “Oh, we're gonna do something.” “It's not okay that this happened.” “Look over here, right?” “Oh, look over here.” The <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span> put <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> on a list. Now that he's dead, we demand post justice. And <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash Patel</a></span> is doing that. He's acting right now. He's pretending that he's delivering some form of justice. I think <span id="ent-person-elon-musk-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/person-elon-musk.md">Elon Musk</a></span> tweeted about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a></span> being on the list, and then it kind of caught fire.

Yes, the <a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a> was training FBI agents and sharing intelligence in partnership with the FBI. The FBI and the <a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a> had a partnership, sharing intel. They were training agents. And he says, no more.

They issued a statement immediately. They said, “As we prepare to observe the holiest day of the year on the Jewish calendar.” Oh, that's just like, I guess they're victims somehow. “We have seen the statement from the FBI, FBI Director Patel, regarding the FBI's relationship.” “<a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a> has deep respect for the <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-09-50"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a></span> and law enforcement officers at all levels across <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-09-50"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">the country</a></span> who work tirelessly every single day to protect all Americans regardless of their ancestry, religion, ethnicity, faith, political affiliation, or any other point of difference.” ^t-00-09-50

Okay? It's slave slop. We are the slaves, and they are serving us slop right now. The illusion that things are changing, the illusion that it's left versus right, or that it's Jewish Americans versus everybody else. Hey, Jewish Americans, if you're watching this, you want to wake up to <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-10-35"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span>?

Okay. They don't care. That's all. This is all just slop, left versus right illusion, whatever it is. But the more important question that I want to get to is why now? Why are they putting on this performative bit right now? Well, yesterday, I made an offhand remark about the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-11-19"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span> and the FBI sharing an office in <span id="ent-gpe-connecticut-t-00-11-19"><a href="/entities/gpe-connecticut.md">Connecticut</a></span>. Now I know this because I'm from <a href="/entities/gpe-connecticut.md">Connecticut</a>, so there's no way to try to obscure that fact. Back in <span id="ent-date-2023-t-00-11-19"><a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a></span>, actually, a Catholic investigator revealed this and shared it. ^t-00-11-19

Kyle Undercover wrote, “I gathered property records for the 19 different states that the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-12-03"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span> has a regional office established.

Same building, across the hall, whatever; that's a fact. And it makes sense. You shouldn't be that shocked when they're owning the fact that they share information. It's easier to share information if you're sharing an office space, right?

So it's possible, just to run the other side of things, that this woman captured both of them walking back-to-back and she just was walking near him and she had nothing to do with helping him change. That's all possible, and you should consider that possibility. We don't have answers. But there's something else that's interesting about her. Like I said, the testimony that she provided is interesting, and she is the only person that saw the shooter limping up close.

Just looking over, seeing that he was limping, kind of being like, “Okay,” and then long black shirt, kind of thinking that's kind of weird. It's kind of super hot outside.

Black Angus beef that they have is literally famous for its great flavor. The <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> has taken Black Angus beef to a whole different level because over the last 35 years, <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness.

Elizabeth, great to have you on the show. Thank you for having me, Clayton. I looked at <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-29-07"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>'s case, and I thought, “Well, why don't I get this guy a lawyer? Because that at least puts me near him so I can understand and control the process.” And this is times where they couldn't find the guy a lawyer, and they were kind of scrambling around to figure out who was going to be his lawyer. And I started approaching different firms in <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a>, trying to get him a lawyer for pro bono. ^t-00-29-07

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-t1YtLS1n8Vs/t-00-29-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:29:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YtLS1n8Vs&t=1785" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Clayton Morris / Elizabeth Lane:** So I walked up to one of the most reputable firms in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-29-45"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>, and I asked them if they were willing to represent <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-29-45"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> for pro bono case, and I was extremely surprised what I got from them. First and foremost, they were like, “Yes, we're absolutely on this, because we don't believe that what happened to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-29-45"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was remotely a case of just a single, you know, crazy kid going up and shooting the guy in the neck.” “Like, we don't believe that, so we are more than willing to represent him pro bono.” So I was like, great. So we started the process. And what happened is we realized that we needed lawyers who are actually certified with death penalty. So their certifications didn't live up to that. But there's another interesting thing. ^t-00-29-45

Obviously, I needed a consent from <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a>'s family and/or <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> himself, because he's actually not a minor. He can consent himself. Ironically, we were unable to get in touch with the parents, because as a lawyer, you can't solicit clients. So it's illegal. So you can't just announce yourself that “I'm going to represent <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a>.” So I started doing that. So I got into this process, and I asked my local lawyer firm, “Hey, what's the best way to go around here? Like, we need help to get the lawyer from <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-t-00-30-29"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york.md">New York</a></span> who is certified to represent <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-30-29"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span> to get on the case.” ^t-00-30-29

No matter what happens, they will take the side of the state.” I did not listen to him. And I ended up calling one of the biggest firms in <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a>, just to ask for advice. Like what, what is the situation here? What can we do? They started screaming on the phone. And I was like, “Why do you even care? Like, you don't have a dog in this fight. Why are you so rude on the phone?” So then I said, “Listen, there is a lawyer who's qualified, and he's actually very famous in <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-t-00-31-09"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york.md">New York</a></span>, wants to represent this kid. All I need is a consent from <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-31-09"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> to do so.” “And we think that you can help to this.” ^t-00-31-09

So, <a href="/entities/person-skordas.md">Skordas</a> is a guy who's running as a state prosecutor. So, here's the problem with that. State prosecutor cannot be responsible to find a lawyer for a defendant. That's illegal. That's right, that they will be; they're choosing their own opponent. Yeah, that's what it seems like. And this is something that I've been; I've been wondering about because it seems like an open and shut case for any defense attorney because the government has presented such a crap case unless his attorney is a shill. Yes. So, what I know is that <a href="/entities/person-skordas.md">Skordas</a> is running as a state prosecutor. He's running. Everyone can look it up. ^t-00-31-51

And what I can tell you is that this gang that's running everything, okay? They also are controlling the courts. That's how you get a prosecution against somebody that makes no sense. And why do you do that? Because typically you're hiding government's crimes, right? You want people to stop looking. You want people to stop asking questions. You're not just asking questions. You know, we are implying here that everything you're telling us about the <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-32-51"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> case makes no sense. But these people control the courts. And I gotta tell you another thing. I want to be very clear. They even have figured out how to run a kangaroo court system, total kangaroo court system, where judges do not have to follow the law. ^t-00-32-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-t1YtLS1n8Vs/t-00-33-36.md" class="timestamp-link">00:33:36</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YtLS1n8Vs&t=2016" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, <span id="ent-person-ian-carroll-t-00-33-36"><a href="/entities/person-ian-carroll.md">Ian Carroll</a></span> was on my show speaking about this, pertaining to <span id="ent-person-justin-bieber-t-00-33-36"><a href="/entities/person-justin-bieber.md">Justin Bieber</a></span>. It is a fact. Arbitration courts, so they get you to sign a contract and you agree, if you have an issue, go to arbitration court. Most people don't know what that means. It's a private court where the judge does not have to follow the law. They can just say you're guilty. And when you get to that level there's usually a couple of reasons why they've got these players that work for the government and are willing to lie and cheat and steal, and it is because the government needs a prosecution or you've pissed them off and they need a conviction against you because they're trying to bankrupt you. The corrupt cases, when you get really close to a truth, the government swoops in to try to bankrupt you. ^t-00-33-36

I have full faith in God, and <span id="ent-person-jesus-christ-t-00-36-29"><a href="/entities/person-jesus-christ.md">Jesus Christ</a></span> is my Lord and Savior. As a sinner, I am only saved through His grace and mercy. With that said, if something happens to me, I ask you all to find out which foreign government or powerful people would take heinous actions to stop the information from coming out not only about this issue, but because of the truth that I have been speaking. The people understand what I am saying.” ^t-00-36-29

Why speech is so dangerous is because if it carries truth, it speaks to power. And power is not truth. Power at this moment is a lie. It is a carefully woven lie everywhere, rigged against all of us. That is why I say the action that you can take, right? Don't feel hopeless. Understand they're actually panicking right now. What can you do in your household? Well, the first you can do is do not put your children in their matrix. Take your kids out of school. ^t-00-37-13

Why are they called Seven Weeks? Well, that's because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean, and it's the same time that a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. That's why they donate 10% of every sale to support pregnancy care centers across all 50 states, providing life-saving ultrasounds, resources for moms in need, and real hope for families. And it all started with one simple idea. Use your morning coffee to stand for life. Seven Weeks Coffee is more than a great tasting coffee. It's mold-free, pesticide-free, shade-grown, low acid, and it's organically farmed, so it checks all the boxes. ^t-00-40-05

You might have considered reaching out to my friends in <span id="ent-org-american-financing-t-00-41-27"><a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a></span> but maybe decided against it because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate that you're currently enjoying. There's good news. They have created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment, which gives you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off a high interest debt, free up your cash flow, plus keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront fees. You can call <a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a>, and you'll start saving now.

All right, you guys, comment that I wanna read from <span id="ent-org-youtube-t-00-42-09"><a href="/entities/org-youtube.md">YouTube</a></span> yesterday. It made me so happy. I also shared it on my <span id="ent-org-instagram-t-00-42-09"><a href="/entities/org-instagram.md">Instagram</a></span>, a little encouragement regarding homeschooling, because that is what I am pushing for. This user wrote, “My sister took her four-year-old out of school yesterday. Literally started homeschooling this morning. I cannot go into detail, but I'll say this. Financially, they will be tight, but she said that it is worth it. Since I saw her conviction, I volunteered myself to be his PE and music teacher as his extracurricular activities. Like they say, it takes a village.” Indeed, I love that. I also want you to network with moms in the area because like what you're saying, I can do PE.

We can all feel it spiritually. And I'm telling you these sleeper cells exist in public schools, private schools. They are there. There is a lot of evil that is happening right now. And I hope that if you guys are watching the show, you understand that I am telling you this. I would not tell you this if it was not—I felt it spiritually, and then this happened, and I'm looking into things; it's not making sense. None of it makes sense. We're told left versus right but it's not that; it is all of us versus them, and they're upset that we're united. By the way, I saw this when they were attacking <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-42-54"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a></span>.

Any person that is awake and realizes that that is slave slop. We're never going to be able to shake the true power structure if we keep shouting at one another and not realizing that groups control extremists on both sides. They are fostering, I think, the extremists on both sides intentionally. We'll get into more of that next week. I said I was going to read your comments, and so I should probably do that. Cajun Pinyay writes, “We normal, everyday people thank you and your team for all the hard work trying to make sense of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-43-38"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s fateful event.

We are absorbing all of these bullets—figurative bullets—wherein they're attacking us, attacking our character, psychological operation, paying influencers to say, “That's crazy. Don't even think about it. Everything was above board. We can only trust the feds. Tell us what happened,” right? We can't trust them at all. I hope having learned the origin story of the <span id="ent-org-anti-defamation-league-t-00-44-21"><a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a></span> and their relationship with the FBI, you realize that.

Bill Scott writes, “I came to Christ after going down so many rabbit holes, ending at the same conclusion. Satan runs the world, but God wins in the end. Christ is King.” So well said, Bill Scott.

Thank God for my wife being determined to homeschool. Our two kids love it and have so much time to pursue their talent. It's worth it.” Yeah. So I do the morning stuff for homeschooling. And obviously I just started this week, and I can tell you, I feel more joyful. Like there is something they are taking away from us spiritually by taking our kids for six hours a day, then saying, “Oh, then afterwards they have to do their activities and somehow also find time for homework.” This whole thing is crazy and stupid. Like what are we doing? We're just like literally handing our kids over to the state, and we get no time with them. Like this is so wrong. If you feel it and you need to hear that message today, you can do it, okay? And you're gonna be happy once you do it. ^t-00-45-06

Maybe you're gonna have to cut expenses in some category, but you can do it. And I told you, I was inspired by my sister who was very middle-class, you know, and she's an accountant. And she did it. She just made it. And I was like, “What is my excuse? What is my excuse to not do this exact same thing?” It is a blessing. I'm grateful for that.

And I told him, I looked him in the face, I sat there, and I said to him, <a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Trump</a> Hotel in D.C., “You have to be very careful who you take money from and what you are willing to do for a check.” I think because I was from sort of the opposite side of the tracks, I had better instincts about that, you know? Like, I've always had to kind of survive. ^t-00-50-11

You got to know that just because it's wearing a ball gown and is at <span id="ent-org-mar-a-lago-t-00-50-50"><a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a></span> doesn't mean that it's not a gangster. It's no different. It's no different from where <span id="ent-person-jay-z-t-00-50-50"><a href="/entities/person-jay-z.md">Jay-Z</a></span> came from in the projects selling crack. It's just wearing a ball gown. It's at <a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a>. But that's still a gangster. I can recognize a gangster. And I don't think <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-50-50"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> believed that or saw that until it was, I think, too late. Snake Girl writes, “I really love and appreciate everything that you're doing, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-50-50"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. I'm in England. Would you advise I take my kids out of school immediately?” I would advise that immediately, no matter where you are in the world. Don't forget, <span id="ent-gpe-germany-t-00-50-50"><a href="/entities/gpe-germany.md">Germany</a></span>, they're not allowed to do it. <a href="/entities/gpe-germany.md">Germany</a>, they won, okay? The school system, the government won against your kids. ^t-00-50-50

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-t1YtLS1n8Vs/t-00-51-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:51:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1YtLS1n8Vs&t=3093" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** You get arrested. Could you imagine being arrested for wanting to keep your kids home? Like it's a requirement, especially in today's world where they're getting, factually speaking, dumber and dumber every generation. And they're like, “Nope, we have the right to make them dumber and dumber. We have that right, and you give us your kids all day.” Yes, do it while you can and fight for laws so that that can never happen where you live. That you always have a right to your own children, which is ridiculous that we have to say this. But post-<span id="ent-event-covid-19-pandemic-t-00-51-33"><a href="/entities/event-covid-19-pandemic.md">COVID</a></span> you saw, they'll inoculate your kids. They'll be like, “Actually, we don't just own their minds; we own their bodies.” And we say 97 vaccines in order for them to be allowed to go to public school. Huh? I gotta let you poison my kid to let you poison their mind. ^t-00-51-33

This is really effed up, and we gotta back away, back away very quickly. And yeah, please guys, take your children out of the school system; start homeschooling, and you will be happier. It's the most rewarding thing. It really is just the more you get of children, you are being blessed. KL Blarson writes, “You are one of the few real journalists that has any integrity, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-52-17"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, and you are one of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-52-17"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s few true friends. You have bigger balls than Mrs. <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-52-17"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Macron</a></span>.” I don't know about that. Mrs. <a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Macron</a>'s got some pretty big balls. She's gonna bankrupt me for exposing it. “We'll bankrupt you;” that's what they do. ^t-00-52-17

We will destroy you and your life and everything that you ever know and try to turn your family against you because we're good people.” “And we're victims, always.” Anyways, you guys, new merch on the website. Thank you guys, by the way; we had so many people buy our <span id="ent-org-central-intelligence-agency-t-00-52-56"><a href="/entities/org-central-intelligence-agency.md">CIA</a></span> merch. We don't know, no, but we know. We don't know, no, okay? And soon we are gonna know, no, when it comes to this <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-52-56"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> thing, because I'm getting a lot of information that's getting even more interesting, but I wanted to, as always, take a few days to digest, research, and make sure what I am presenting to you guys has been thoroughly vetted. And are we gonna make mistakes? Of course. ^t-00-52-56

And the witness tree has gone silent. It has never reached out to me. So anyways, we'll see what we come up with. ^t-00-53-42
