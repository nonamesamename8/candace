Happy Tuesday. I'm gonna ask you a question. It's actually a riddle that we're all familiar with. What came<span id="event-event-1908-07-26-charles-joseph-bonaparte-founds-the-fbi-as-attorne-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-1908-07-26-charles-joseph-bonaparte-founds-the-fbi-as-attorne.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> first, the chicken or the egg? That's what's on my mind. That's what's on my mind really all day because yesterday we were explaining to you guys this sort of random coincidence—maybe not a coincidence— of the FBI seemingly choosing to work in offices<span id="event-event-2018-04-14-us-and-france-conduct-missile-strikes-on-syrian-go-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2018-04-14-us-and-france-conduct-missile-strikes-on-syrian-go.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> that are kind of being run by, like, <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> royalty, in essence, right? These old <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a> American families. Now, why would our FBI do that? Surely they would have been aware that they were choosing to work in buildings that might potentially have some foreign interests. But then you know what? It clicked. The chicken came before the egg. Of course. Don't be ridiculous. That's the answer to the riddle. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-a-e7HC6SeK8/t-00-00-46.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:46</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-e7HC6SeK8&t=46" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** LOL to the American history that's taught to us in the public schools. The <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a> helped to establish the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">United States</a></span>. They came over and they helped us win our big independence from the big bad Brits. And then what? They just left us alone. It was just an act of charity. Like, we're good. We want nothing in return. We just want you guys to be free. Does that make sense to you? Come on. Turns out, actually—and you may have known this; maybe I'm just American ignorant—but our FBI was founded by the <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a>. In theory, the FBI really is in <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span>'s building over in <span id="ent-gpe-wilmington-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a></span>. If you think about it for a long time—and I have now been thinking about this for a long time. So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. ^t-00-00-46

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-a-e7HC6SeK8/t-00-02-09.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:09</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-e7HC6SeK8&t=129" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** "I believe that the purpose of <a href="/entities/person-emmanuel-macron.md">Macron</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-emmanuel-macron-t-00-02-09"><a href="/entities/person-emmanuel-macron.md">Emmanuel Macron</a></span>'s) lawsuit was that it was supposed to go nowhere because <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-02-09"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> was supposed to have been assassinated before the case got to court." Then they could forever claim that <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> was lying, which is evident by the fact that they were suing her for, quote-unquote, "defamation," before someone had killed her. "This<a href="/events/event-2009-01-01-dupont-heir-robert-richards-iv-convicted-of-raping.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a> was their plan, but I pray that it has now been foiled." I had never considered that, and that hit really deeply, and that is a dark thought. And I think now<span id="event-event-2009-01-01-dupont-heir-robert-richards-iv-convicted-of-raping-t-00-02-09"><a href="/events/event-2009-01-01-dupont-heir-robert-richards-iv-convicted-of-raping.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> I am wondering. I have a lot of questions. Everything feels different in this post-<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-09"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk world. Where to begin? How about we should talk about the founding of <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-02-09"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>? Because, man, those Catholic priests that I was telling you about—they were unbelievably correct. ^t-00-02-09

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-a-e7HC6SeK8/t-00-02-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-e7HC6SeK8&t=175" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I told you guys a long time ago how when I was considering whether or not I should be Orthodox or Catholic, but I knew that I was sort of done with Protestantism, I had been taking instruction from these priests in <span id="ent-gpe-europe-t-00-02-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-europe.md">Europe</a></span> and in the UK, and one of the fathers is a real bookworm, right? Kind of this cantankerous Englishman—no time for the American education system<span id="event-event-1996-01-26-john-du-pont-shot-and-killed-olympic-wrestler-davi-t-00-02-55"><a href="/events/event-1996-01-26-john-du-pont-shot-and-killed-olympic-wrestler-davi.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> whatsoever. And he said to me, quite famously, "You Americans know nothing of your own history. Your country was founded by <span id="ent-org-freemasons-t-00-02-55"><a href="/entities/org-freemasons.md">Freemasons</a></span>." And that just kind of permanently now echoes in my ear because boy, was he right. ^t-00-02-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-a-e7HC6SeK8/t-00-03-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-e7HC6SeK8&t=213" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** A war that had been sort of waging across <span id="ent-gpe-europe-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-europe.md">Europe</a></span> for centuries had then spilled into <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>. It was largely a spiritual war. It was really a theological war. That's what I'm starting to realize. That's why <a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a> never really had an appetite for Orthodox or Catholicism because the Catholics and the Orthodox have kept history. They know what was going on in <a href="/entities/gpe-europe.md">Europe</a>—not the fake history that's packaged and sold to Americans. They know what the <span id="ent-org-freemasons-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/org-freemasons.md">Freemasons</a></span> were up to—<a href="/entities/org-freemasons.md">Freemasons</a> who caused all of those revolutions against really the Christian empire across <a href="/entities/gpe-europe.md">Europe</a>. The idea, really—I now think—is to keep Americans fat, dumb, drugged, and propagandized, right? ^t-00-03-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-a-e7HC6SeK8/t-00-04-18.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:18</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-e7HC6SeK8&t=258" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And then when we need to use their men to mass murder other <span id="ent-concept-christians-t-00-04-18"><a href="/entities/concept-christians.md">Christians</a></span> overseas. That's the big picture that I'm beginning to see. All of this to say, did you know that our FBI was founded by <span id="ent-person-charles-joseph-bonaparte-t-00-04-18"><a href="/entities/person-charles-joseph-bonaparte.md">Charles Joseph Bonaparte</a></span>? I had no idea. I hate to be American ignorant, but I had no idea. And yes, that man was the founder. And yes, that is like <a href="/entities/person-napoleon-bonaparte.md">Napoleon</a><span id="event-event-1908-07-26-charles-joseph-bonaparte-founds-the-fbi-as-attorne-t-00-04-18"><a href="/events/event-1908-07-26-charles-joseph-bonaparte-founds-the-fbi-as-attorne.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> Bonaparte. His grandfather—Charles's grandfather—was <span id="ent-person-napoleon-bonaparte-t-00-04-18"><a href="/entities/person-napoleon-bonaparte.md">Napoleon Bonaparte</a></span>'s brother. This is like—this is great uncle. <a href="/entities/person-napoleon-bonaparte.md">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> was his great uncle, which makes it kind of hilarious, right? ^t-00-04-18

Mentioning the <a href="/entities/org-dupont-family.md">DuPont family</a> led to a flurry of tips coming out of <a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a>. It was incredible. People in <a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a> saying, "Yeah, no, they own kind of everything—like everything: hospitals, schools, buildings. You name it; it is theirs." And then we received some more tips from people ^t-00-04-57

They were telling us, "Hey, I went to school with DuPonts. Like, there's a lot of stories there." And these stories sound a lot like what you were covering in your Becoming <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a></span> series. You remember—actually, right before we had been sort of interrupted in Becoming <a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a> series two, season two—we were speaking about Eric Dupond-<span id="ent-person-eric-dupond-moretti-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/person-eric-dupond-moretti.md">Moretti</a></span>. Eric Dupond-<a href="/entities/person-eric-dupond-moretti.md">Moretti</a>. And we were speaking about how he was kind of known and had made a name for himself making an argument for happy incest.

Again, this was <span id="ent-org-dupont-family-t-00-06-21"><a href="/entities/org-dupont-family.md">DuPont</a></span> folklore, if you will. But then more emails came in, and you know what? It's not entirely folklore, okay? It's really just not. This is actually an article that appeared in <span id="ent-org-vanity-fair-t-00-06-21"><a href="/entities/org-vanity-fair.md">Vanity Fair</a></span>, so let's read it together. And I'm gonna issue a trigger warning right at the top because it is disturbing. Today's episode in general, I should say, is not for the faint of heart. Here's the headline. "<a href="/entities/org-dupont-family.md">DuPont</a> heir gets no prison time for raping three-year-old daughter." Okay. And the person who emailed us over said this has actually kind of lived in me for over a decade because I was so disturbed by the story, and you should read this. ^t-00-06-21

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-a-e7HC6SeK8/t-00-07-02.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:02</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-e7HC6SeK8&t=422" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And it tells us that <span id="ent-person-robert-richards-the-fourth-t-00-07-02"><a href="/entities/person-robert-richards-the-fourth.md">Robert Richards the Fourth</a></span> was in <span id="ent-date-2009-t-00-07-02"><a href="/entities/date-2009.md">2009</a></span> convicted of raping his three-year-old daughter, seven years after she—who was just five—told relatives that she didn't want her father to be touching her anymore. Then it says, in an alarming twist, the judge who sentenced the heir to the <span id="ent-org-dupont-family-t-00-07-02"><a href="/entities/org-dupont-family.md">DuPont</a></span> <span id="ent-org-fortune-t-00-07-02"><a href="/entities/org-fortune.md">fortune</a></span> let him off with no jail time, arguing that the six-foot-four Richards will not fare well in prison. That was the argument that the lawyer made, and the courts in <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-07-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span> found that to be valid. So instead of sentencing him to prison for raping a toddler, it goes on and tells us that Judge <span id="ent-person-jan-jordan-t-00-07-02"><a href="/entities/person-jan-jordan.md">Jan Jordan</a></span> rules that Richards would benefit from treatment instead. ^t-00-07-02

And the details of the case became public this month when Richards' ex-wife sued him for damages related to the abuse of their daughter. Here is how the <span id="ent-org-news-journal-t-00-07-45"><a href="/entities/org-news-journal.md">News Journal</a></span> describes the convicted rapist. In this case, quote, "Richards, who is unemployed and supported by a trust fund, owns a 5,800-square-foot mansion in <span id="ent-gpe-greenville-t-00-07-45"><a href="/entities/gpe-greenville.md">Greenville</a></span> that he bought for $1.8 million in <span id="ent-date-2005-t-00-07-45"><a href="/entities/date-2005.md">2005</a></span>."

Because it seems like waiting until later is not really an option because we're already living in the later. You should consider adding gold into your financial strategy because if economies destabilize and the markets get scared, currencies can lose their value, but gold does not always follow suit. Having some gold means that you're not 100% dependent on one financial system. You'll instead have something tangible. And for me, it's about planning; it's about protecting. And of course, I'm not saying that you should dump everything that you have into gold because that would be as misguided as sticking with just stocks. But balancing your investments is definitively crucial. If you're worried about retirement or worried about the current economy, then let this be your little nudge. ^t-00-34-52

Also, I've been telling you guys about Beekeepers Naturals because this holiday season may be full of joy, travel, and togetherness, but it also happens to overlap with peak cold and flu season.

I'm gonna share that. I feel that we are headed toward war—that they want war by any means necessary—and that you need to be—wherever you are in the world—fully dialed into that. Okay—we can't be stupid this time. We cannot believe what the media is telling us. We cannot believe what the government is telling us.

It happens with just a one-page document that has a forged signature that can get filed at the county. And if your title—which is the legal record of ownership—gets transferred out of your name, criminals can then use your ownership to drain your equity or even sell your property. And you won't even know about it until you start getting collection notices and foreclosure notices in the mail. That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock so that you can protect your equity and find out today if you're already a victim. Use my promo code <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-50-01"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> at hometitlelock.com, and you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock protection.

Thank you. I love meeting your generation because I do think that that was the last generation that had real values. You know—<span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-57-57"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span> lost its way when we decided that we would do anything for money—which is what <a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin</a> <span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-57-57"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Netanyahu</a></span> said on camera. You know—"<a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a> is something you can move very easily with money." Not this American—so there's that. And <span id="ent-person-amir-t-00-57-57"><a href="/entities/person-amir.md">Amir</a></span> writes, "I voted for my taxpayer funds to go from the <span id="ent-org-central-intelligence-agency-t-00-57-57"><a href="/entities/org-central-intelligence-agency.md">CIA</a></span> towards the <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> Intelligence Agency for all of her investigative work because at this point she is one of the rare public figures that are actually fighting for truth." Sadly—I mean—I just really thought there would be more allies. And there are some. Like I said, there are some good feds. There is an underground movement that is happening. ^t-00-57-57

You can do that in a variety of ways. Like I said—buying gear. We've got new kit available on the website—which we're excited about.
