There's a lot that I would like to speak with you guys about. Can't wait to hear your feedback. A lot of lies that are being put out there and narratives that I would say are half-truths or just misrepresentations entirely. And I don't really see the reason for that. First and foremost, to let you know, last week was not a dream. Charlie Kirk, my friend, is dead. And he was publicly executed. I want to make that clear. Charlie Kirk was publicly executed before the world. And as we were all searching for answers, the ones that are being supplied to us are not making a lot of sense. And some people, I would say, are speaking too much, are speaking on behalf of other people. ^t-00-00-00

I will say something that I think brought the world a lot of relief. Also, you know, sadness, we were grieving with her, was when his wife, Mrs. Erica Kirk, addressed not just the nation, but the entire world. Her words were very powerful. And we just have a very brief portion of her remarks, which you should pursue in their entirety. But here she is. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(69); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:01:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-01-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea. You have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country. In this world, you have no idea. You have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife. The cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry. To everyone listening tonight across America, the movement my husband built will not die. ^t-00-01-09

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(122); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:02:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-02-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Beautiful, powerful words. Charlie had just one wife. What we got to see across this weekend is that there were so many people around the world, like she said, who were deeply moved by Charlie Kirk throughout their lives and of course have been deeply moved by this tragedy and what she is describing there, that fire. A lot of us are feeling it. I am definitely feeling it. I had a very tough weekend, a very tough weekend. I will say this: my entire life, I've not been much of a crier. It is not my choice emotion. I'm not a person who bursts into tears. And many, some people are like that. This weekend, I didn't just cry. I wept. I wept. I wept for Charlie. ^t-00-02-02

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(165); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:02:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-02-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Obviously, I didn't make it through the tribute to him on Friday. For those of you who wanted to see me in a moment of weakness, that was delivered to you. Fair. Yeah, I watched my friend get shot in the neck. That's what happened. I just want to say that he was publicly executed again before the world. The question is why, right? You know, when you are in a state of grief, you go through a lot of emotions. And I'm arriving right now at a lot of anger, the audacity of some people. It has taken much restraint and prayer. And I had to speak with a priest. I had to go to confession. ^t-00-02-45

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(207); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:03:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-03-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** These emotions that I am having, wanting to respond with Charlie in his own words, really. People that are coming forward and saying this is what he thought and this is how he should be remembered. It just feels really inappropriate to me. I didn't know what to do other than to scroll through messages between me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk), regarding which there are a ton of them. And kept going back and watching the video, the many videos, of us dancing to the song “Power.” And it felt appropriate to reach out to Ye, speaking about things, talking about his mode when he wrote the song. You know, when you wrote the song “Power,” why did we have it as our hype song? Because... ^t-00-03-27

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(251); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:04:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-04-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The song is about the ability to find it within yourself, to become what you know you are capable of becoming inside of a matrix, when you just realize everything is dishonest, that everything is performative, that people are dishonest, that they are going to try to stop you from being great. In fact, it's the end of the song, the question that he asks at the end of the song, that's the most important. Ye asks, do you have the power to let power go? Do you have the power to say no to power? You know, I told you guys that Charlie was going through a spiritual transformation at the end and all of the usual suspects were really angry that I hinted towards that. “What do you mean? You don't want to say that.” ^t-00-04-11

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(296); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:04:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-04-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** They were attacking me, trying to make me fearful to speak out and speak about the things that I know. I'm not feeling very fearful right now. I am, like I said, very angry. And I found, you know, Charlie's favorite portion of the song. I'll show you the text between him and I, because this feels very relevant right now. This is, again, lyrics directly from the song “Power.” I just needed time alone with my own thoughts, got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault. My childlike creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts. Reality is catching up with me. ^t-00-04-56

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(337); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:05:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-05-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody with these responsibilities that they entrusted me. And that's a moment where he is really speaking about how hard it is, like when you're saying, no, this is what I believe, and they say, you're not allowed to believe that. You feel like you are fighting for custody of yourself. And I want to be very clear that I believe, in fact I know, that towards the end, Charlie was fighting for custody of himself. I want to say that. I want to say that plainly. And there are lies that are being told and they need to be slapped down right now. There's one person who's been out there acting like he is a widow, ^t-00-05-37

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(376); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:06:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-06-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** you know, just saying the absolute most, tweeting first about what happened to Charlie, following it minute to minute, you know, and doing hits in a foreign country, you know, like making time to do hits on Fox News, two of them. Benjamin Netanyahu is, who's fighting, I think, like an 84-front war with everyone, made a lot of time for Charlie Kirk. You would have thought they were the best of friends, as close as him and Trump were, but I will say I don't recall Erika mentioning Benjamin Netanyahu in her speech. The way he's presenting it is like he was, I mean, this is just the worst loss for him, but I don't think that that is the truth. In fact, I know for a fact that he is misrepresenting some things that happened there towards the end. ^t-00-06-16

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(422); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:07:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-07-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So let's at first listen to what Benjamin Netanyahu, just one day, less than 24 hours after Charlie died, what Benjamin Netanyahu had to say on Fox News. Take a listen. ^t-00-07-02

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(437); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:07:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-07-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** We're just heartbroken. Myself, my wife, my family, my son actually, on his 2019 visit to Israel, had lunch with him and his wife Erica. We're shattered first as human beings because a great human being has been taken from us. He was an extraordinary friend. He said—he wrote me a letter on May 2nd this year. He said, one of my greatest joys as a Christian is advocating for Israel and forming alliances to defend Judeo-Christian civilization. The tragedy yesterday. ^t-00-07-17

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(482); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:08:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-08-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** I called him, and I spoke to him, and I said, please come to Israel. I invited him to Israel. And sadly, that visit will not take place. But he was a defender of our common Judeo-Christian civilization. He was unbelievably excited to walk at the footsteps of Jesus here. He valued our bond, the bond between America and Israel. You know, he did so many things to defend free speech. He had his truth. He stood up for it. But he said, you can come and debate me. He invited that debate. He certainly didn't invite the violence, the horrible violence, that tried to silence him. And, you know, this is a worldwide problem. ^t-00-08-02

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(523); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:08:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-08-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** The people on the—you know, on the extremes, the Islamists, the radical Islamists and their union with the ultra-progressives, they often speak about human rights. They speak about free speech, but they use violence to try to take down their enemies, whether it's President Trump, who's been almost assassinated twice or—you know, they try to kill me here, too. But they got Charlie Kirk, and it's just heartbreaking. ^t-00-08-43

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(555); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:09:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-09-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Who is they, Benjamin? Who is they who got Charlie Kirk? We don't have to actually speak conspiracies. I'm just wondering because you said a lot there, but it really sounded like it was about Benjamin Netanyahu trying to establish a narrative, a narrative that we saw reinforced by a lot of people, that, you know, Charlie, kind of made it almost sound like he died for Israel. I mean, Trump's account even tweeted out a photo of Charlie, an American flag and also an Israeli flag, a bit of AI used, you know, like this is just who Charlie was. He says Judeo-Christian values. He spoke to him two weeks ago. ^t-00-09-15

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(589); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:09:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-09-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Again, you would think he was busy fighting this 97,000-front war, but no, he's letting you know that he just randomly, what, picks up the phone and calls Charlie Kirk and invites him to Israel. How did Benjamin do that? It seems like maybe there's a little more to the story. No, there definitely is a little bit more to the story. First and foremost, that letter he is holding up, he is severely misrepresenting. Those sentences are real, but I am calling upon Benjamin Netanyahu, the dear friend to Charlie Kirk, to publish the letter's entire contents. Like, don't start with just two sentences, publish the entire thing. You're holding it. ^t-00-09-49

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(627); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:10:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-10-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I'm saying you're severely misrepresenting the contents that in May, Charlie was concerned about Israel and their influence on American politics and how they were pushing things that he felt were in conflict with his beliefs, free speech here in America. Benjamin's holding it up like Charlie, just in May, said, hey, you know what? I just want to write a love letter to Israel. That's how it was presented. Would you guys agree? That's not how it happened. Now, regarding that phone call and that invite, that also needs to be contextualized. And I'm going to do that. ^t-00-10-27

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(668); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:11:08</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-11-08.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But first, Skylar, can we bring in a clip of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) from a month ago, speaking about the kind of pressure that he was under? Because I think that will also help to further contextualize this. Take a listen. ^t-00-11-08

Yes, I want Israel to win. Yes, I'm a Christian, but like the—some of the mess, and you saw it. ^t-00-11-22

No, it's very irritating. ^t-00-11-31

They were coming after you, after Turning Point, for among other things. ^t-00-11-36

Dave Smith is allowed to criticize Israel. Both sides, the Israeli side was a little represented. You're not allowed to, though. ^t-00-11-41

**🎤 SPEAKER_5**

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(709); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:11:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-11-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_5:** No, you're not allowed to. ^t-00-11-49

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(710); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:11:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-11-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** It's even worse than that. Again, I just want to repeat for the fifth time. I love Israel. I want Israel to win. But my moral character is now being put into question, Megyn. Not my decisions, not like, hey, are you doing this, is it smart or is it dumb? But no, I am a bad person if I do this. And it's a—I could go—I mean, you saw it, Megyn. It was trending on Twitter, thousands of tweets and text messages. And if I were to be charitable and generous, I will say the people that are attacking me are in a hyper-paranoid state, because they're at war, and war tends to make things black and white, and you're a hammer looking for a nail. So I'm trying to be charitable, Megyn, literally. I'm trying to cut as much slack as I can, right? ^t-00-11-50

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(753); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:12:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-12-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** Like, okay, what would it be like if all of a sudden I'm starting to see a pattern of behavior similar to what my grandparents saw in 1930s Germany online? How would I behave? So that's like my charitable kind of overcompensation spirit. At the same time, I'm like, but it's not defensible to be dumb, right? ^t-00-12-33

**🎤 SPEAKER_5**

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(775); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:12:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-12-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_5:** No, it's not defensible to be dumb. ^t-00-12-55

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(777); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:12:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-12-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And he was under an increasing amount of pressure, not just people telling him, oh, well, you know, I'm upset with who you're inviting, but flat out telling him that he was not allowed to invite certain people to his events. They were threatening to pull out money. Charlie was getting a lot of really nasty text messages, and many of them pertaining to Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens, but Tucker Carlson was really the focus when it came to AmericaFest. How could Charlie allow these debates about Israel to take place? How could he allow Dave Smith, who by the way is Jewish, how could Charlie allow this other position to meet the stage? ^t-00-12-57

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(820); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:13:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-13-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Because obviously when people start to hear the debates, what Dave Smith is saying sounds so rational, but it was up to Charlie to not allow those things to happen. Those—that amount of pressure towards the end, as you see, that conversation he had with Megyn was just a month before he lost his life, really, I would say, reached a pinnacle of sorts on the matter of what Tucker Carlson actually said on that stage. Tucker Carlson, while he was on that stage at Turning Point, brought up Bill Ackman. Bill Ackman is a billionaire, obviously. He is also an extremely litigious billionaire. ^t-00-13-40

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(859); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:14:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-14-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And Bill Ackman was on Charlie about comments that Tucker Carlson had made on that stage. Tucker Carlson specifically asked the question, where does Bill Ackman's money come from? You know, who is this guy? Actually, who is this guy that has this much influence? And like I said, Bill Ackman was not happy about this. And so I would like to contextualize Benjamin. Again, these are things Benjamin brought up publicly, which he didn't have to. He didn't have to bring up the letter. He didn't have to bring up the phone call, but he chose to do this, less than 24 hours after Charlie Kirk was shot. Personally, Benjamin, I would have appreciated if you guys used all of your spyware you had spying on us for years to maybe track down the killer. ^t-00-14-19

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(901); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:15:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-15-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But I guess this is where you thought it was best, to do a little propaganda for Israel would be better than helping us track down the killer. But anyway, so... Benjamin Netanyahu and that phone call, what took place was a couple of weeks ago before Charlie lost his life. Charlie was in the Hamptons and he had more than one event, but he had essentially what was staged an intervention. It was staged by Bill Ackman because Charlie's thoughts, Charlie's rational thoughts, about Israel were a no-no. This is not the route that you should be going on. ^t-00-15-01

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(945); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:15:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-15-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And Charlie was surrounded by his friends, quote-unquote friends. Bill Ackman was very upset and threats were made. That is what I am told, and I will tell you that I am very happy for Bill Ackman to dispute this narrative. In fact, he was asked to dispute this narrative. Max Blumenthal went out to him today and Bill Ackman came back and said, I have receipts, I can show you. And he did not provide the receipts. And “this is not how it went down.” I know it went down this way. I'm waiting for one of them to go on record and to say that it didn't go down this way. ^t-00-15-45

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(988); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:16:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-16-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It was at this time that Benjamin Netanyahu was called and Charlie was invited to Israel. This was an under duress situation, I would say, because I've been in these situations before. When I started asking, very sensible questions about Israel, as someone who had dedicated her political life to supporting Israel, many times alongside Charlie Kirk, I was met with the very same pressure. And just like Charlie was being invited to Israel, I was invited somewhere else. And when this arrived to me, it felt like a threat. ^t-00-16-28

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1025); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:17:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-17-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It felt like a threat, not like, hey, come here and we can educate you because you're my friend—more like, this is your last chance. That's how it felt to me. I can't speak to how it felt to Charlie. And I know that Charlie was offered a ton of money in this moment. A ton of money. Benjamin would fund it, you know? Spend tons of money. And Turning Point, I guess, if it needed to go to a higher level, would have gone to an even higher level than it already was at. And I know for a fact that Charlie denied that funding. That Charlie denied—and what Benjamin didn't include there, ^t-00-17-05

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1069); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:17:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-17-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** he declined to go to Israel for, I would describe this as like, you know, reeducation camp. You know, we've seen it. You may not—oh, but we can help you, you know, we just need you to come out to Auschwitz and take a picture. Yeah. We just need you to come to the Holocaust museum and take a photo. We just need you to go to Israel and we can make this better. Charlie said no to Benjamin, okay. Bill Ackman, if you would like to dispute that, I would love to hear what you say happened, because our sources and what we have, it's solid, okay. There were conversations that took place, messages that were sent at that time, and they are solid. ^t-00-17-49

If you've been listening to my show, Seth Dillon, I was going to go out to Seth Dillon, and I decided to message him last night about this Hamptons meeting. And Seth Dillon, who is normally very quick with a response, has not yet been able to respond. I'll show you this text message chain. And I want to be clear, I am not someone who normally publicizes text messages.

He was a giant of a man.” I said, any comment on this one, Seth? He didn't answer last night. This morning I said, need a comment ASAP, please. He didn't answer. Then I followed that up and I said, trying again here, you were present when Ackman lost his mind on Charlie and when Benjamin invited him to Israel and Charlie refused. Text messages immediately following this meeting are circulating. I find Ackman's statement, as though the meeting was somehow cordial, to be incredibly disturbing. Are you at all disturbed by that tweet? ^t-00-19-14

He was unable to speak to me, but he did place some frantic calls to Turning Point USA. Yeah. You see, I went out to Seth, but I also went out to two other people who were at this meeting, and nobody is willing to go on record. They're all messaging each other trying to figure out a coordinated response to say that, no, this was all quite cordial. But no one wants to go on record and describe it as cordial, because they know someone's leaking, because someone's got a guilty conscience about what happened at the Hamptons. ^t-00-19-58

I am inviting you guys, I will give you my platform actually, to come clear matters up, to tell us what really happened, because, you know, I think Charlie was definitely on the brink of changing some of his perspectives. ^t-00-20-41

Charlie was going to mass. One of my last conversations with Charlie was me joking with him saying, just make the last step, okay? You are a— I said, specifically, you're too smart to be a Protestant. Just take the last step, Charlie. He says, ha ha, speaking about Mary. And typically, when those steps start taking place, you stop referring to yourself, as I did, as a Judeo-Christian. ^t-00-21-25

I didn't hear that. Erica was very clear that Charlie was a Christian, and I believe Charlie, obviously, was very much a Christian and that things are not being told truthfully. In fact, I will also call upon—since we're having fun—Turning Point USA to release the audio of what Charlie Kirk— ^t-00-21-58

I'm calling upon Turning Point to release the footage of what Charlie said to Tucker Carlson before he hit the stage, before all of that craziness and the response to Tucker Carlson's remarks played out. Charlie was miked. Surely Tucker Carlson was miked. I know Charlie's miked the entire time at those events. So I'm asking for everyone to just release Charlie in his own words.

And instead, if you're gonna hold up the letter, release it in its entirety, okay? Why don't you release your messages, Bill? I'll release mine. Let's all just be very forthcoming about what took place. In fact, I'm calling upon Tucker Carlson to speak about that. I know what Charlie said to him, and I'm sure Tucker Carlson won't lie about it. What did Charlie say to you? Dave Smith, what did Charlie say to you? What was Charlie— did he seem like he was treading in the direction— do we feel like what Benjamin is saying is an honest representation of what Charlie was going through? This is what I want.

No, we have no evidence of that. We can't say that because there is no evidence of that. But I don't like little lies. That's what I will say. Something that I always say in my household is when there is one lie, there's 20. There's no reason to lie. Benjamin could have gone on Fox News and he could have told the truth. He could have said truthfully that Charlie Kirk has always loved Israel. He has always loved Israel as the Holy Land. ^t-00-24-03

That's not what he said. Okay, he talks about the phone call and didn't give it the proper context. He held up the letter and didn't give it the proper context. And lies by severe omission, I'd like to be very clear, are lies. Lies by severe omission are lies. You're not gonna gaslight us and tell us to shut up or call us antisemitic for pointing out the fact that Charlie was having a change of heart about the tactics that Israel was using in America and that he felt, when he had left that meeting, that he had effectively been blackmailed. ^t-00-24-40

My platform is yours, Bill Ackman. So if you wanna clarify it, we can do it in front of millions, okay? And I think that that's what people deserve because everyone has PTSD. We watched Charlie get shot in the throat. That feels a little bit symbolic. It feels like they wanted us to know that his voice was problematic. Again, I don't know who they is. After we take this brief break, we're going to go through the investigation, which seems to have a lot of inconsistencies and holes in it.

Epstein was not some sort of whiz-kid hedge fund manager. Epstein was playing a part. Epstein was a LARPer. Epstein was cast for a specific role, and he played it really well.

It is open source, so imagine GitHub, but designed for on-chain collaboration and composability. Builders actually get credit for their work and they get rewarded, so every time their code gets used, that's the real value in this. It's not likes, it's not clout, it's actual rewards.

We're supposed to believe he walked, parked his car and then walked onto campus. They're saying that after that video that you just saw of him walking, he got into his car, and then drove to campus and then at 8:29 p.m. on campus is when he arrives. Already confusing, but let's just keep going. We don't need to poke holes. Let's just keep going with the narrative. Then we're back to TMZ and they release that at 11:49 a.m. they have footage of the shooter, who has now changed his outfit. We're supposed to gather that again on a doorbell cam, and he's in a different outfit. ^t-00-41-09

Take a look at this. Okay. And for those of you that are listening to this on audio, you are going to see someone who appears to be limping. Okay. So maybe he changed his outfit at some point and now he's limping. And the idea that we're seeing floated is that he's limping because he's holding the gun in his pants, okay? That's kind of what's been floated, okay? That has not particularly come from the feds. I don't believe so, but he's limping now and he's got on a different outfit. Okay. ^t-00-41-53

Maybe that's not accurate. So let me just skip off of that because, Skylar, we should actually look to research that. But at 12:23 p.m. is when Charlie Kirk is shot. Okay. And 12:23 p.m. is when—that in that same minute is when we have footage that shows us that as the crowd ducks, and it's blurry, the shooter runs across the rooftop. I'm gonna tell you why that's significant. ^t-00-42-33

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(2589); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:43:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-43-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So 12:23, Charlie Kirk is shot, and we are going to have an angle of that and the image of the black person—person in black, rather—that is running across the rooftop. Take a look at this. They're down, clearly. And right away, look at that, okay? And we have another—the footage shows us, there's another actually clip that I was looking for, Skylar, there, that it actually shows him running across the rooftop. You guys may have seen it. ^t-00-43-09

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(2624); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:43:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-43-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The reason why that footage is problematic as you start to see them ducking and then you see the shooter immediately start moving across the rooftop is that their narrative is that he disassembled the gun and then started running. So that's a bit confusing to us, of how he was able to do that so quickly. An unbelievable amount of hunters, guns, people that reached out to me and said, that just didn't happen. They have, exactly as Michael said, that did not happen. There is no way that that happened. That cannot be accurate. Then, and this is obviously the craziest part of everything, we have decoy boy, right? So it happens and suddenly this guy, George Zinn, gets arrested. ^t-00-43-44

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(2669); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:44:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-44-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He's making noise. He's signaling that he's somehow shot the guy. And at 12:52, it gets announced that the suspect is in custody. So nobody needs to look around anymore because the suspect is in custody. But actually I guess George Zinn just does that. He just does that, I guess. Just wants people to think he's done something, but he hasn't actually done anything. That, again, to me, feels like he's a decoy. More people are involved in this, and I will say that. We don't know, but we know that something's wrong with this. Then at 12:29 p.m., we have TMZ showing us that there's a person running through the backyard. They are saying this appears to be the suspect running. ^t-00-44-29

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(2714); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:45:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-45-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, now we're going to show you that clip. It is very grainy. So they're alleging that that's him. We couldn't confirm that. And the feds have not confirmed that. But it does show you that someone's running across the back again. That's at 12:29 p.m. I don't know, we don't know. I'll give you some other facts that you should probably know just in general that have been thus far confirmed. The weapon, they say, was found in the woods and it was wrapped by a dark towel. Okay, now, when they gave us a photo of that weapon, it was fully assembled. So this is kind of what Michael Savage is saying. ^t-00-45-14

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(2756); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:45:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-45-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He's saying, okay, so then they reassembled it, or maybe the feds did, maybe they're gonna clarify that they reassembled it for a photograph, but we are told that it was found wrapped in a dark towel. Then we have been told that a screwdriver was found on the roof. So they're sticking to this implication that he undid, perhaps undid, this gun while he was on the rooftop and he, you know, wanted to make sure he unscrewed it with the screwdriver, left the screwdriver behind, but took the gun, but then left the gun in the woods. Okay. Then we get—and this has not been contextualized, and I can't wait until it is contextualized. ^t-00-45-56

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(2798); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:46:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-46-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We get photos that are the shooter. This is when the FBI came out and said, he's in a stairwell. We don't know exactly where that stairwell is. He's in outfit number two. So the outfit change has happened, okay? There's no timeline again, but we can discern that there is no weapon that is in his pant leg because we can see him bending one leg in one photo and we can see him bending the other leg in another photo. So we're unclear about this. What is clear is that there is a ton of cameras on this campus. There is a lot of footage that they could release to make the public feel better about this. I mean, tons of different angles. ^t-00-46-38

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(2841); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:47:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-47-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I don't know why we're getting grainy shots at all. There have been tons of people online going through the tech stack of UVU campus and saying, like, hey, why are we getting grainy— why don't you give us clearer images? In fact, you guys could show us an image here, here, here, here, here, here. They're not doing that. They're just going with this, like, grainy image and saying that's it. And you can get this grainy image, but we can't tell you much more. Now, again, it's an open investigation. They're under a lot of pressure, there is no question. ^t-00-47-21

Nothing they are saying feels good to me. Honestly, the thing that they said that felt the best to me is when they said that there's probably somebody else involved. That sounds about right. Two people maybe. Maybe these aren't even the same people. Maybe the guy in the maroon is not the same as the guy in the black shirt. That would make sense, because why change your outfit? Both of these look like you would blend in on a college campus. So why are you blending in twice? Does that make any sense to you? Why would you change your outfit? ^t-00-47-50

I just want to change my outfit for funsies. And then we hear that Tyler Robinson, when he's apprehended, it is communicated to us that he is wearing the maroon outfit. Now, I want to be clear. They said this was 33 hours later. So he changed his outfit, I mean, ostensibly because he wants to avoid detection would be the only thing that I think is reasonable to assume. But then he changes back into the outfit that he was wearing before the shooting, for what reason? Thirty-three hours later, like no shower time? He wanted them to know that it was him on the camera? That's not clear to me. Why are we changing outfits? ^t-00-48-34

I think it's reasonable to ask that question. Are there two different people that are involved? Another thing that's not clear to me is that the story that we were told was that Tyler Robinson allegedly, after speaking with the pastor, his dad turned him in—Bill Ackman, probably a million dollars, right? Thanks, Bill. You really cared about Charlie. And that money is now going to the father of this child, who, after prayer and speaking to a pastor, they're saying, okay, well, he turned himself in. We were told he turned himself in. Now we're being told that actually he hasn't confessed. ^t-00-49-18

Did the pastor just say he did it? Did the father say he did it, but they didn't have any proof? Again, this is obviously—everyone's investigating. We yield to them. Do I think this kid was involved somehow? Yeah. Do I think he did this alone? Absolutely not. This story makes entirely no sense. And then there's this random Discord, over Discord, okay? So Governor Cox came out and told us that there were messages about the rifle drop point. Okay. Discord says not the same thing.

Investigators interviewed that roommate who stated that his roommate, referring to Robinson, made a joke on Discord. Investigators asked if he would show them the messages on Discord. He opened it and showed several messages to investigators and allowed investigators to take photos of the screen as each message was shown by Robinson's roommate.

Again, unclear why he did that, unclear why he would then put the outfit back on 33 hours later. Most people just, like, shower within that time. I did receive contact from one of Tyler Robinson's classmates and they said that that was the strangest part to them. They told me that that was the strangest part, the 33-hour putting on an outfit that he had on 33 hours earlier, because they described him as remarkably tidy. He was a tidy individual. So that flagged them as weird. Just seems like a little extra work. Again, unnecessary, completely unnecessary. You're getting nothing out of changing your outfit.

Again. Maybe they need more time and they're going to get more time. They're going to get a lot of time because it will be never that I let this go. It will be absolutely never that I let this go. Everything just spiritually feels very wrong here. Yeah. It feels like we are being lied to by who? I'm not sure. Are there some good guys?

They're a 5G network that is insanely fast, dependable. They are also secure. You can definitely brag about how much money you save with PureTalk. Unlimited talk, text, and plenty of data is just 25 bucks a month, saving the average family over $1,000 a year. It's time to switch to my wireless company, PureTalk.

You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing but hesitated to do so because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. Well, there's good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike an HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment giving you peace of mind.

I would say right now, at book club—and you don't need to join that—but you should read “The Assault on Truth.” It's a good start, okay, to understand that Sigmund Freud is celebrated in schools as the father of modern psychology. He is the father of nothing but modern gaslighting, and that's what they do. They gaslight repeatedly, okay? Don't believe your own eyes. ^t-01-01-30

You got to confront real evil. And then I would recommend you read David Bakan, “Sigmund Freud and the History of the Jewish Mystical Tradition.” I think those are probably just—and that doesn't even get into, like, the history of Israel, but it will help you. ^t-01-02-10

I would definitely read Shlomo Sand. There is a book called “The Invention of the Jewish People” that gets into Israel full stop. He was, I believe, a professor, a historian, at Tel Aviv University. That's an important one. And you will note that all these books that I'm recommending, by the way, were written by Jewish authors because that makes you aware of the fact that you're not diving into something that can be labeled anti-Semitic. Because, I mean, these people were like in the IDF, you know what I mean? And so there's no incentive for them to lie. ^t-01-02-48

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(3814); return false;" class="timestamp-link">01:03:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-01-03-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But if you just want to jump right into Israeli history, I would say Shlomo Sand would be a good start. “The Invention of the Jewish People” is a good one. And he took a lot of flak for having written it, standing up to neo-historians, which is who we are also fighting. They are neo-historians. They publish a lot. And you believe they're kind of creating this matrix of history, that there's very little truth there. Kari writes, “All death can do to the believer is deliver him to Jesus.” That's fantastic. And you are absolutely correct. Jordan Giacolini writes, “Pray for Candace Owens.” M. Skim writes, “Go Candace, go, but be careful.” ^t-01-03-34

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(3858); return false;" class="timestamp-link">01:04:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-01-04-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** No one was more careful than Charlie Kirk, and he still got a bullet in the throat. So that's why I like to say that. Amanda Moore writes, “Contributing for the fight. May God protect you and your family. By the way, these are really big donations that are coming in right now to me, and I thank you because when I tell you, I am... I will catch more lawsuits to get the truth out about Charlie Kirk if I have to. Okay. That's all these people have is threats, lawsuits, contracts, lawyers. I'm sick of it. I am sick of it. Truly. I am done. I’m done. Okay. I'm done. That's it. It took Charlie Kirk dying for me to—F, like literally, I want you to know—F you. ^t-01-04-18

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(3902); return false;" class="timestamp-link">01:05:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-01-05-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Like truly, I mean that. I don't care. I'll expose everything. You guys who are watching know what I know. So tell the truth. Just tell the truth for once in your miserable lives. I need to calm down. I told the priest I would chill. I did. No, I didn't. I actually said I just needed time. But I understood that my anger was wrong. And the priest told me that that is like, you know, everybody struggles with certain things. Mine is vengeance. I have to work on that. So I would like to apologize for my tone 10 seconds ago. IPO TV writes, “It seems pretty clear what's happening here and I'm shaking my head. ^t-01-05-02

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(3942); return false;" class="timestamp-link">01:05:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-01-05-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I didn't follow Charlie but was moved by his passing— a little something for security and no more ‘over your dead body’ talk. We need you. Stay strong and safe.” Thank you for saying that. And I'm here. I'm here. I am obviously still not okay. I don't know if I'll ever be okay from having watched that, but I am focused. Mandy writes, “Christ is King and hopefully is returning very soon.” Tony Hill writes, “I constantly pray for Charlie Kirk and his family as well as you and your family. Their plan is causing division in our country. We need to take what they did to Charlie and come together to fight their evil, not each other. Candace, we have your back.” ^t-01-05-42

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(3978); return false;" class="timestamp-link">01:06:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-01-06-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Yeah, I know I've been a little snippy because it's really hard to see people, especially going back into, like, every message me and Charlie ever shared, that did nothing but try to destroy him. Like, just the pretense of nobility stresses me out. It does. But I won't—every week I will get better. And I'm trying. I am trying to be gracious and not angry. Anger is my choice of emotion at this moment. Divine Council writes, “Candice, I have joined you as a voice for truth. I changed my channel the day of Charlie's murder and I took my mask off. It’s hard being a black conservative. Please look into the book ‘The Thirteenth Tribe.’” I've heard a lot about that book. It's about the origin of the Ashkenazi Jews, the Khazars. ^t-01-06-18

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(4022); return false;" class="timestamp-link">01:07:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-01-07-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Yeah, I mean, you can also read their own books and they said they were the Khazars. So, you know, I've covered that on my show extensively. Look up Abraham Polak. He won awards for saying they were the Khazars and tracing them back. So again, we are fighting neo-historians and you should just accept that everything that you learned in a textbook is not real, which is why I say get your kids out of these schools. If you want to honor Charlie, get your children out of these public schools. Not even—the private ones too. I want to be very clear. It's a communist movement. It always has been communist. They need your children. That is the one resource that they can't buy, and that's your children, okay? Because that protects their dynasty, to be able to have their minds, to impact their minds, to lie to them. It is psychology. ^t-01-07-02

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(4066); return false;" class="timestamp-link">01:07:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-01-07-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's why reading about Sigmund Freud is very important, to understand what modern psychology is and how much they have invested—how much time they have invested—into thinking about how they're going to raise up your children, okay? It is wicked, it is evil, it is disturbing, but you need to know it. You need to know it. Read “The Assault on Truth,” process it, and recognize that when you grew up, you were told to honor that monster, okay? Up is down and down is up. Question everything. We certainly will be questioning everything. Ciara writes, “Candice, after I posted my prayers to Charlie's family, I was blocked and removed by people I once considered close to me. It's sick how many people I see in my everyday life that support such an ungodly act. ^t-01-07-46

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(4111); return false;" class="timestamp-link">01:08:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-01-08-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Christ is King, praying for you and your family.” Thank you very much. Christ is King. The tributes around the world towards Charlie lifted up my heart. There is a lot more that I will say, but I again want to invite people to lie first. I want to invite people to lie.

I know who you are too. I'm writing that down, so tread carefully, you know? Because I wouldn't want to get caught up in lying right now. I wouldn't want to be you and be caught up in lying right now. Because the truth is going to win. The truth is going to come out. We'll see you guys tomorrow. ^t-01-09-14
