There's a lot that I would like to speak with you guys about. Can't wait to hear your feedback. A lot of lies that are being put out there and narratives that I would say are half-truths or just misrepresentations entirely. And I don't really see the reason for that. First and foremost, to let you know, last week was not a dream. <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-08-27-bill-ackman-stages-intervention-on-charlie-kirk-in-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-27-bill-ackman-stages-intervention-on-charlie-kirk-in.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><a href="/events/event-2025-08-15-charlie-kirk-interviewed-by-megyn-kelly-on-israel.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2025-08-27-benjamin-netanyahu-calls-charlie-kirk-inviting-him-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-27-benjamin-netanyahu-calls-charlie-kirk-inviting-him.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><a href="/events/event-2025-05-02-charlie-kirk-sends-letter-to-benjamin-netanyahu.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2025-09-12-tribute-event-held-for-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-12-tribute-event-held-for-charlie-kirk.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, my friend, is dead.

I will say something that I think brought the world a lot of relief. Also, you know, sadness—we were grieving with her—was when his wife, Mrs. <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span>, addressed not just the nation, but the entire world. Her words were very powerful. And we just have a very brief portion of her remarks, which you should pursue in their entirety. But here she is. ^t-00-00-44

**🎤 Erika Kirk**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-01-09.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:09</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czVBmqZP6Ss&t=69" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Erika Kirk:** If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea. You have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country. In this world, you have no idea. You have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife. The cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry. To everyone listening tonight across <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-01-09"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>, the movement my husband built will not die. ^t-00-01-09

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-02-02.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:02</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czVBmqZP6Ss&t=122" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Beautiful, powerful words. <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-02"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> had just one wife. What we got to see across this weekend is that there were so many people around the world, like she said, who were deeply moved by <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> throughout their lives and of course have been deeply moved by this tragedy and what she is describing there, that fire. A lot of us are feeling it. I am definitely feeling it. I had a very tough weekend, a very tough weekend. I will say this: my entire life, I've not been much of a crier. It is not my choice emotion. I'm not a person who bursts into tears. And many—some people are like that. This weekend, I didn't just cry. I wept. I wept. I wept for <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. ^t-00-02-02

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-02-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czVBmqZP6Ss&t=165" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Obviously, I didn't make it through the tribute to him on Friday. For those of you who wanted to see me in a moment of weakness, that was delivered to you. Fair. Yeah, I watched my friend get shot in the neck. That's what happened. I just want to say that he was publicly executed again before the world. The question is why, right? You know, when you are in a state of grief, you go through a lot of emotions. And I'm arriving right now at a lot of anger, the audacity of some people. It has taken much restraint and prayer. And I had to speak with a priest. I had to go to confession. ^t-00-02-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-03-27.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czVBmqZP6Ss&t=207" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** These emotions that I am having, wanting to respond with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-27"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> in his own words, really. People that are coming forward and saying this is what he thought and this is how he should be remembered. It just feels really inappropriate to me. I didn't know what to do other than to scroll through messages between me and <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, regarding which there are a ton of them. And kept going back and watching the video, the many videos, of us dancing to the song “Power.” And it felt appropriate to reach out to Ye, speaking about things, talking about his mood when he wrote the song. You know, when you wrote the song “Power,” why did we have it as our hype song? Because... ^t-00-03-27

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-04-11.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czVBmqZP6Ss&t=251" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The song is about the ability to find it within yourself, to become what you know you are capable of becoming inside of a matrix, when you just realize everything is dishonest, that everything is performative, that people are dishonest, that they are going to try to stop you from being great. In fact, it's the end of the song, the question that he asks at the end of the song, that's the most important. Ye asks, do you have the power to let power go? Do you have the power to say no to power? You know, I told you guys that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-11"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was going through a spiritual transformation at the end and all of the usual suspects were really angry that I hinted towards that. “What do you mean? You don't want to say that.” ^t-00-04-11

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-04-56.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:56</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czVBmqZP6Ss&t=296" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** They were attacking me, trying to make me fearful to speak out and speak about the things that I know. I'm not feeling very fearful right now. I am, like I said, very angry. And I found, you know, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s favorite portion of the song. I'll show you the text between him and I, because this feels very relevant right now. This is, again, lyrics directly from the song “Power.” I just needed time alone with my own thoughts, got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault. My childlike creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts. Reality is catching up with me. ^t-00-04-56

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-05-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czVBmqZP6Ss&t=337" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody with these responsibilities that they entrusted me. And that's a moment where he is really speaking about how hard it is, like when you're saying, no, this is what I believe, and they say, you're not allowed to believe that. You feel like you are fighting for custody of yourself. And I want to be very clear that I believe, in fact I know, that towards the end, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-37"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was fighting for custody of himself. I want to say that. I want to say that plainly. And there are lies that are being told and they need to be slapped down right now. There's one person who's been out there acting like he is a widow, ^t-00-05-37

Myself, my wife, my family, my son actually, on his 2019 visit to <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-07-17"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, had lunch with him and his wife <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-07-17"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span><span id="event-event-2019-01-01-netanyahus-son-visited-israel-and-had-lu-t-00-07-17"><a href="/events/event-2019-01-01-netanyahus-son-visited-israel-and-had-lu.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>.

I invited him to <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a>. And sadly, that visit will not take place. But he was a defender of our common Judeo-Christian civilization. He was unbelievably excited to walk at the footsteps of <span id="ent-person-jesus-christ-t-00-08-02"><a href="/entities/person-jesus-christ.md">Jesus</a></span> here.

We're supposed to believe he walked, parked his car and then walked onto campus. They're saying that after that video that you just saw of him walking, he got into his car, and then drove to campus and then at 8:29 p.m. on campus is when he arrives. Already confusing, but let's just keep going. We don't need to poke holes. Let's just keep going with the narrative. Then we're back to TMZ and they release that at 11:49 a.m. they have footage of the shooter, who has now changed his outfit. We're supposed to gather that again on a doorbell cam, and he's in a different outfit. ^t-00-41-09

Take a look at this. Okay. And for those of you that are listening to this on audio, you are going to see someone who appears to be limping. Okay. So maybe he changed his outfit at some point and now he's limping. And the idea that we're seeing floated is that he's limping because he's holding the gun in his pants, okay? That's kind of what's been floated, okay? That has not particularly come from the feds. I don't believe so, but he's limping now and he's got on a different outfit. Okay. ^t-00-41-53

Maybe that's not accurate. So let me just skip off of that because, Skylar, we should actually look to research that. But at 12:23 p.m. is when <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-42-33"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> is shot. Okay. And 12:23 p.m. is when—that in that same minute is when we have footage that shows us that as the crowd ducks, and it's blurry, the shooter runs across the rooftop. I'm gonna tell you why that's significant. ^t-00-42-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-czVBmqZP6Ss/t-00-43-09.md" class="timestamp-link">00:43:09</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czVBmqZP6Ss&t=2589" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So 12:23, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-43-09"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> is shot, and we are going to have an angle of that and the image of the black person—person in black, rather—that is running across the rooftop. Take a look at this. They're down, clearly. And right away, look at that, okay? And we have another—the footage shows us, there's another actually clip that I was looking for, Skylar, there, that it actually shows him running across the rooftop. You guys may have seen it. ^t-00-43-09

So that's a bit confusing to us, of how he was able to do that so quickly. An unbelievable amount of hunters, guns, people that reached out to me and said, that just didn't happen. They have, exactly as Michael said, that did not happen. There is no way that that happened. That cannot be accurate. Then, and this is obviously the craziest part of everything, we have decoy boy, right? So it happens and suddenly this guy, <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-43-44"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span>, gets arrested. ^t-00-43-44

He's signaling that he's somehow shot the guy. And at 12:52, it gets announced that the suspect is in custody. So nobody needs to look around anymore because the suspect is in custody. But actually I guess <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-44-29"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span> just does that. He just does that, I guess. Just wants people to think he's done something, but he hasn't actually done anything. That, again, to me, feels like he's a decoy. More people are involved in this, and I will say that. We don't know, but we know that something's wrong with this. Then at 12:29 p.m., we have TMZ showing us that there's a person running through the backyard. They are saying this appears to be the suspect running. ^t-00-44-29

It is very grainy. So they're alleging that that's him. We couldn't confirm that. And the feds have not confirmed that. But it does show you that someone's running across the back again. That's at 12:29 p.m. I don't know, we don't know. I'll give you some other facts that you should probably know just in general that have been thus far confirmed. The weapon, they say, was found in the woods and it was wrapped by a dark towel. Okay, now, when they gave us a photo of that weapon, it was fully assembled. So this is kind of what <span id="ent-person-michael-savage-t-00-45-14"><a href="/entities/person-michael-savage.md">Michael Savage</a></span> is saying. ^t-00-45-14

Then we have been told that a screwdriver was found on the roof. So they're sticking to this implication that he undid, perhaps undid, this gun while he was on the rooftop and he, you know, wanted to make sure he unscrewed it with the screwdriver, left the screwdriver behind, but took the gun, but then left the gun in the woods. Okay. Then we get—and this has not been contextualized, and I can't wait until it is contextualized. ^t-00-45-56

This is when the FBI came out and said, he's in a stairwell. We don't know exactly where that stairwell is. He's in outfit number two. So the outfit change has happened, okay? There's no timeline again, but we can discern that there is no weapon that is in his pant leg because we can see him bending one leg in one photo and we can see him bending the other leg in another photo. So we're unclear about this. What is clear is that there is a ton of cameras on this campus. There is a lot of footage that they could release to make the public feel better about this.

Nothing they are saying feels good to me. Honestly, the thing that they said that felt the best to me is when they said that there's probably somebody else involved. That sounds about right. Two people maybe. Maybe these aren't even the same people. Maybe the guy in the maroon is not the same as the guy in the black shirt. That would make sense, because why change your outfit? Both of these look like you would blend in on a college campus. So why are you blending in twice? Does that make any sense to you? Why would you change your outfit? ^t-00-47-50

Now, I want to be clear. They said this was 33 hours later. So he changed his outfit, I mean, ostensibly because he wants to avoid detection would be the only thing that I think is reasonable to assume. But then he changes back into the outfit that he was wearing before the shooting, for what reason? Thirty-three hours later, like no shower time? He wanted them to know that it was him on the camera?

Another thing that's not clear to me is that the story that we were told was that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-49-18"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> allegedly, after speaking with the pastor, his dad turned him in—<span id="ent-person-bill-ackman-t-00-49-18"><a href="/entities/person-bill-ackman.md">Bill Ackman</a></span>, probably a million dollars, right? Thanks, Bill. You really cared about <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-49-18"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. And that money is now going to the father of this child, who, after prayer and speaking to a pastor, they're saying, okay, well, he turned himself in. We were told he turned himself in. Now we're being told that actually he hasn't confessed. ^t-00-49-18

Because if I say, my kid did it, that's enough for an arrest? What if the kid says he didn't do it? I didn't do it. Dad says you did. Okay, how did they arrest him without a confession? I'm gonna show you <span id="ent-person-governor-cox-t-00-50-00"><a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a></span>'s statement where he says that the kid has not confessed.

Well, all we can confirm is that those conversations definitely were happening, and they did not believe it was actually him.

He is not cooperating. But all the people around him are cooperating. And I think that's very important. There were reports yesterday that we can confirm that his roommate was indeed a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female. That's information that the FBI had mentioned yesterday.

You do not want your children to be in that environment spiritually. This is everywhere. This was a part of this movement, understanding there's an underground communist movement, and it is at all schools. I want to be very clear. So if you can—and I'm telling you, you can—take your children out of these schools and homeschool. That's what I want. I want to build this legacy by encouraging people to homeschool. Now, in terms of specifically how people can learn about <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-01-00-47"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, for me, judge them by their actions, not how everyone feels when you're friendly with them.

That's not normal. There are so many books that can get you started on your journey, but if there's one that I would recommend everybody read because you need to understand the beast that you're dealing with, what kind of lies are willing to be told and sold. I would say right now, at book club—and you don't need to join that—but you should read “<span id="ent-work-the-assault-on-truth-t-01-01-30"><a href="/entities/work-the-assault-on-truth.md">The Assault on Truth</a></span>.” It's a good start, okay, to understand that <span id="ent-person-sigmund-freud-t-01-01-30"><a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a></span> is celebrated in schools as the father of modern psychology.

That's an important one.

And he took a lot of flak for having written it, standing up to neo-historians, which is who we are also fighting. They are neo-historians. They publish a lot. And you believe they're kind of creating this matrix of history, that there's very little truth there. Kari writes, “All death can do to the believer is deliver him to <span id="ent-person-jesus-christ-t-01-03-34"><a href="/entities/person-jesus-christ.md">Jesus</a></span>.” That's fantastic.

So that's why I like to say that. Amanda Moore writes, “Contributing for the fight. May God protect you and your family. By the way, these are really big donations that are coming in right now to me, and I thank you because when I tell you, I am... I will catch more lawsuits to get the truth out about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> if I have to. Okay. That's all these people have is threats, lawsuits, contracts, lawyers. I'm sick of it. I am sick of it. Truly. I am done. I’m done. Okay. I'm done. That's it.

I don't care. I'll expose everything. You guys who are watching know what I know. So tell the truth. Just tell the truth for once in your miserable lives. I need to calm down. I told the priest I would chill. I did. No, I didn't. I actually said I just needed time. But I understood that my anger was wrong. And the priest told me that that is like, you know, everybody struggles with certain things. Mine is vengeance. I have to work on that. So I would like to apologize for my tone 10 seconds ago.

We need you. Stay strong and safe.” Thank you for saying that. And I'm here. I'm here. I am obviously still not okay. I don't know if I'll ever be okay from having watched that, but I am focused. Mandy writes, “Christ is King and hopefully is returning very soon.” Tony Hill writes, “I constantly pray for <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and his family as well as you and your family.

Like, just the pretense of nobility stresses me out. It does. But I won't—every week I will get better. And I'm trying. I am trying to be gracious and not angry. Anger is my choice of emotion at this moment. Divine Council writes, “<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-01-06-18"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, I have joined you as a voice for truth. I changed my channel the day of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>’s murder and I took my mask off. It’s hard being a black conservative. Please look into the book ‘The Thirteenth Tribe.’” I've heard a lot about that book. It's about the origin of the Ashkenazi Jews, the Khazars. ^t-01-06-18

So, you know, I've covered that on my show extensively. Look up <span id="ent-person-abraham-polak-t-01-07-02"><a href="/entities/person-abraham-polak.md">Abraham Polak</a></span>. He won awards for saying they were the Khazars and tracing them back. So again, we are fighting neo-historians and you should just accept that everything that you learned in a textbook is not real, which is why I say get your kids out of these schools. If you want to honor <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-01-07-02"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, get your children out of these public schools. Not even—the private ones too. I want to be very clear. It's a communist movement. It always has been communist. They need your children. That is the one resource that they can't buy, and that's your children, okay? Because that protects their dynasty, to be able to have their minds, to impact their minds, to lie to them. It is psychology. ^t-01-07-02

It is wicked, it is evil, it is disturbing, but you need to know it. You need to know it. Read “<span id="ent-work-the-assault-on-truth-t-01-07-46"><a href="/entities/work-the-assault-on-truth.md">The Assault on Truth</a></span>,” process it, and recognize that when you grew up, you were told to honor that monster, okay?
