Where to begin? Well, in the final days leading up to <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s assassination, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was pretty busy, right? He went on a first time trip to Asia, quite a quick trip, quite at least a quick turnaround to go first to <span id="ent-gpe-south-korea-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-south-korea.md">Korea</a></span> for a couple of days and then off to <span id="ent-gpe-japan-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-japan.md">Japan</a></span>. And honestly, If I was a conspiracy theorist and I kind of am one, I might think at this stage that the timing of that trip might have been intentional because something was going on back home that they didn't want him to see. Well, what I'm about to tell you guys today is going to positively blow your mind. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-t4U7NjnUEgc/t-00-00-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4U7NjnUEgc&t=41" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I just cannot see how this would lead to anything other than a full confession from the government about the military's involvement in his assassination. But I'm just going to deliver the facts and see where they land. Welcome back to Candace. I am just going to tell you guys exactly how everything came about, everything that I'm about to deliver to you. Yesterday was a holy day of obligation in the Catholic church.<span id="event-event-2025-12-08-candace-owens-attends-mass-on-feast-of-t-t-00-00-41"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-08-candace-owens-attends-mass-on-feast-of-t.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-00-41

A day of obligation means that a day in which you are required to attend mass outside of obviously typically Sundays. And so as soon as we concluded this podcast, grabbed my jacket and I ran out the door, okay? And as I was sitting through mass deciding, I guess what was on my mind to pray about for whatever reason got on my knees and I was not expecting this to come out, but I just focused my prayer on wanting Something to be delivered to me a piece of evidence that would help us put together the full picture of this assassination. Obviously, we all know that what we are being told is not true. ^t-00-01-26

It's one thing to point out all the lies, but we need to also have solid concrete proof of something that took place that was out of the ordinary in the days leading up, maybe, I don't know, a planning session. Well, I got back home after this very intentional prayer and did my routine, had a very late dinner, I went up and said goodnight to the kids, got myself ready for bed, sat in bed, and I thought, you know what, I'm just going to open the tips box.<span id="event-event-2025-12-08-candace-owens-receives-email-from-witnes-t-00-02-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-08-candace-owens-receives-email-from-witnes.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-02-10

It was a young woman and she said, you really should call my friend. It is absolutely urgent and he has information that you need to hear. And don't tell me why, I don't know what came over me, but maybe it was this intentional prayer. I said, I'm just gonna call him right now. ^t-00-02-53

The person that I spoke with, his name is or was <span id="ent-person-harry-myers-t-00-03-26"><a href="/entities/person-harry-myers.md">Harry</a></span>. And he told me a story which I have since fact-checked various elements, the elements that I could fact-check. And it's legit. This is a legit story that I'm about to share with you.

Okay, I can tell you that he is being 100% honest and you're free to look further into this. I am certain he is going to probably be doing a lot of interviews in the near future. I can also factually state that there was an incident report. ^t-00-04-05

He could not fully comprehend why what was happening was happening. So let's start actually 35 years ago, because you need to know who this man is. In 1990, this young man named <span id="ent-person-harry-myers-t-00-04-35"><a href="/entities/person-harry-myers.md">Harry</a></span> Myers discovered something that would shape the next three decades of his life. He was at the bottom of the military chain. ^t-00-04-35

And it should be noted that this took place just to kind of get you back into what was going on at the beginning of the 1990s.

Now, our protagonist in the story is <span id="ent-person-harry-myers-t-00-07-30"><a href="/entities/person-harry-myers.md">Harry</a></span>, right? 20 years old and he's at the bottom of the military totem pole. And he gets attached to this new command, this new Southern command. Previously, there had never been that joint task force. And specifically, he was a part of operation that came to be known as <span id="ent-event-operation-catacomb-t-00-07-30"><a href="/entities/event-operation-catacomb.md">Operation Catacomb</a></span>. He describes himself, and I'm going to put this in quotations, as a lowly military censor guy assigned to this joint task operation six, and they were to cover half of <span id="ent-gpe-arizona-t-00-07-30"><a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a></span> and <span id="ent-gpe-mexico-t-00-07-30"><a href="/entities/gpe-mexico.md">Mexico</a></span>.

Using jackhammers and torches, federal agents broke into the concrete reinforced tunnel at a warehouse in <span id="ent-gpe-douglas-arizona-t-00-09-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-douglas-arizona.md">Douglas, Arizona</a></span>. 30 feet underground, agents walked for 100 yards through the five foot high tunnel. It took them under the <span id="ent-gpe-mexico-t-00-09-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-mexico.md">Mexican</a></span> border to a house in <span id="ent-gpe-agua-prieta-t-00-09-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-agua-prieta.md">Agua Prieta</a></span>. There they found an air compressor, a sump pump, a small trolley car, and a hydraulic jack. It was used to lift up the floor inside the living room of the house where the smugglers would start their illegal trip to the U.S. Authorities said when the tunnel wasn't being used for drug running, the smugglers would flood it with water. Let's say we came over here with some technology trying to detect this. It would look like an underground stream if it was flooded. ^t-00-09-51

And he's like, no, I'm just here over an incident that happened 35 years ago. I'm trying to get answers regarding it. And they're putting pressure on him. I'm going to write this verbatim.

That's when I drove a Tucson. I got a room. The next morning I turned in my rental car. I got on a plane back home and I had to stop in Salt Lake. Upon landing and turning on the phone, my wife is telling me about <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-22-54"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>.

If you haven't yet tried Riverbend Ranch steaks, it is time that you did, because I've never had a better steak in my entire life. For the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. They only use the top one or two percent of the entire Angus population as their breeding stock, producing beef that has much more flavor and tenderness than your average Angus beef. Each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. All Riverbend Ranch cattle were born and raised right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-32-44"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. And the beef is processed right at their ranch in their award-winning USDA-inspected processing facility. ^t-00-32-44

And you'll love the fact that you also get to support American ranchers. Right now, when you order from RiverBendRanch.com and you use promo code Candace at checkout, you will get $20 off your first order. Again, that's RiverBendRanch.com promo code Candace at checkout. I also want to remind you guys about pre-born because when they double down on abortion, we have to double down on supporting life. Through our partnership with pre-born, we can help save babies and support mothers that are in need because every day, pre-born's clinics rescue hundreds of babies because when a mother sees her baby on an ultrasound and hears that tiny heartbeat, her chance of choosing life doubles. ^t-00-33-29

That means twice as many ultrasounds, twice as many lives being saved, and twice as many mothers that are given hope. They're also provided diapers, car seats, counseling, and care for up to two years. If you've heard about Preborn before and you've not yet taken action, there is no better time than right now. Their work is some of the most important work to help heal our country. One ultrasound is just $28, but you can give 10 times that amount if you are able to.
