**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-00-01.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:01</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=1" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** All right, you guys. So a week before <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> lost his life, he expressed some concerns about the finances at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. In fact, he wanted to put together an entire department, a little mini-department, to address those concerns. And we have evidence of that. It is always the advice when investigating any crime to, quote-unquote, "follow the money." So let's do that just a little bit here. Plus, there is a video that has gone absolutely viral. I am sure you have seen it. It was emailed to me many times, where there is a theory that is being floated that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was shot from the back. Now, there are two aspects in that video that we can debunk, and I wanna do that. And there's one aspect that we cannot debunk clearly. I think this is a worldwide investigation. ^t-00-00-01

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-00-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=45" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I wanna assist wherever it is that I can. So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-45"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. There's a lot of leaking going on right now, and I've been very clear that everything in my soul has been screaming at me from the very moment that I found out that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-45"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> got shot, that this story is much bigger, that there just was something much bigger going on than what has thus far been presented to the public. ^t-00-00-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-01-27.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=87" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** All of the wrong people are eulogizing him. They're lying about small things, which I don't like, because why lie about small things? Only a guilty conscience of sorts lies about little things. And there are a few points that we have covered throughout the story that right away jumped out at me as odd, first and foremost, of course, <span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-01-27"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></span> (<span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-01-27"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israeli</a></span> PM) over-inserting himself, not even just on day one, minute one. He tweeted before the president of the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-01-27"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">United States</a></span> that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-27"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> had lost his life. That's weird. ^t-00-01-27

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-01-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=118" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It's very weird, and we should not forget how weird that is, especially because when he went on multiple hits doing<span id="event-event-2025-09-09-suspicious-amazon-book-listing-appears-detailing-c-t-00-01-58"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-09-suspicious-amazon-book-listing-appears-detailing-c.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-09-assassination-of-charlie-kirk-by-shooting-goes-vir-t-00-01-58"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-09-assassination-of-charlie-kirk-by-shooting-goes-vir.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> <span id="ent-org-fox-news-t-00-01-58"><a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a></span> and <a href="/entities/person-greta-van-susteren.md">Greta Van Susteren</a>'<span id="ent-person-greta-van-susteren-t-00-01-58"><a href="/entities/person-greta-van-susteren.md">s</a></span> show, he lied about the contents of a letter that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-58"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> had written him back in May. What I also don't like are the people like <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-01-58"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span> and <span id="ent-person-seth-dillon-t-00-01-58"><a href="/entities/person-seth-dillon.md">Seth Dillon</a></span>, people that I know who are very nasty and work behind the scenes. I don't like that they have not yet been honest or forthcoming about the pressure that they and others were putting on <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. That just strikes me as odd. There's no reason to lie. No reason to pretend that you weren't doing that, to try to massage it and lie about it. ^t-00-01-58

And of course, who could forget the word length<span id="event-event-2025-09-09-benjamin-netanyahu-tweets-about-charlie-kirk-s-dea-t-00-02-40"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-09-benjamin-netanyahu-tweets-about-charlie-kirk-s-dea.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> of <span id="ent-person-bill-ackman-t-00-02-40"><a href="/entities/person-bill-ackman.md">Bill Ackman</a></span>'s reply. I tell you guys about this weekend in the <span id="ent-gpe-hamptons-t-00-02-40"><a href="/entities/gpe-hamptons.md">Hamptons</a></span>. I tell you about <span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-02-40"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></span> (<a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israeli</a> PM) calling <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-40"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and inviting him to <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-02-40"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>. And <a href="/entities/person-bill-ackman.md">Bill Ackman</a> replies with an essay. A college essay, 959 words to be precise, was his response to me speaking about that, where he himself did not actually address my point about the quote-unquote "intervention," which is how <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> described it himself. And my point about <a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> (<a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israeli</a> PM) and the offer to take <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-40"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> to the next level financially, no one wants to address those points. ^t-00-02-40

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-03-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=206" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Because I was being honest, people thought that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) ideas were trending in the wrong direction. And by the way, regarding that now infamous weekend, the response videos that were made, which seemed like there was some sort of a PR crisis going on, the response tweets that were fashioned, they were sort of getting funny. <span id="ent-person-xavier-derusso-t-00-03-26"><a href="/entities/person-xavier-derusso.md">Xavier DeRusso</a></span> was there. I had reached out to him. He had, rather than answering me, messaged me to say, "I am speaking out about that weekend." He made a video where he formally addressed the weekend and explained that yes, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-26"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, and he uses the phrase "moral blackmail." ^t-00-03-26

We can take a listen to Xavier <span id="ent-person-xavier-derusso-t-00-04-07"><a href="/entities/person-xavier-derusso.md">DeRusso</a></span> in his own words. ^t-00-04-07

And he goes, "What would happen if I do this?" There was discourse, and then there was one woman who sat in the back who said, "If you do that, you're indirectly going to empower <span id="ent-org-hamas-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/org-hamas.md">Hamas</a></span>." And then <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was like, "See, you have to stop saying like that." He was saying that when you are debating about <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, you need to stop doing it emotionally. You need to do it logically and factually, otherwise you lose the debate. He said it is moral blackmail if you say that somebody saying that a politician is bad, that you're then empowering a terrorist organization. Fair argument. ^t-00-04-24

Fighting for free speech. Even if you disagreed with somebody, you know, you got to make sure that they have a right to express their viewpoints. And what happened to me a year earlier seemed to be happening to him one year later.

Every excuse that I have been handed for why they won't release it makes no sense to me. If you are under pressure, if people are starting to look at you funny as an organization, if they're thinking that, whether rightfully or wrongfully, if they are suspecting because they see this footage of someone quickly remove the SD cards that you guys had something to do with the assassination of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-14"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, and you quite literally have footage that in theory should vindicate yourself, why wouldn't you release it? Think about that. It's just in your own capacity. If somebody is saying you are guilty of anything, they're like, "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-09-14"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, you are absolutely guilty of breaking into my car." And I'm like, "I have a camera right here that shows that I did not break into your car." Would it make sense if I was like, "But I'm not gonna release that"? "I'm not gonna release that.

What? It makes no sense. I don't understand why they would not release this. The idea that it's because, well, the feds are saying—the feds cannot arrest you.

So as you know, I have been positively obsessed with who killed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-12-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> because he was my friend.

And it occurred to me that I forgot about one video, actually the only video that exists of the shooter sprinting across the rooftop mere seconds after the shot was fired. Now, you probably recall that video in the back of your mind. You remember that video that was going viral with him seen running across the roof. Well, I'm about to show it to you in a much clearer quality than you have ever seen it, a higher quality than you have ever seen that video.

Maybe that's the towel that we've been told about. We can play that again as you watch this. Now, let me tell you how I tracked down this footage. It took me all of two hours to track down this footage, to get the name of the person who had filmed the footage and to, from there, after messaging someone on <span id="ent-org-twitter-t-00-13-28"><a href="/entities/org-twitter.md">Twitter</a></span>, they said, "I got the footage from this person." This is the person that shot it, and he's willing to speak to you. I get in touch with this individual, okay, very quickly. This all transpired in a couple of hours, and you will never guess what it is that he told me. ^t-00-13-28

I'm sorry, what? You have one of two people who have a recording of the shooter at all, right? At all. And the feds were simply not interested as they were executing this manhunt of reaching out to the individual who had footage of him running across the roof. How could that be? Why? ^t-00-14-12

Somebody explain to me, make it make sense for me. Maybe in the fog and the <span id="ent-work-chaos-t-00-14-44"><a href="/entities/work-chaos.md">chaos</a></span>, sure. But at no point did they go, "Hey, hmm, I see this really grainy image that's gone viral on <span id="ent-org-twitter-t-00-14-44"><a href="/entities/org-twitter.md">Twitter</a></span>. Maybe I should reach out to the person that made it go viral and see if I can track down that person so I can get clear data, meaning the metadata that exists, which will tell you the exact second that the person was running, to make sure it lines up with my federal timeline that I must be creating." If little old <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-14-44"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> is doing it, then I'm sure the feds at the top are definitely creating a second-by-second timeline just like I am, but no, they never reached out to him. ^t-00-14-44

We spoke about that earlier this week. He told us the exact same thing. He says he walked in and gave the footage to the <span id="ent-org-orem-police-department-t-00-15-27"><a href="/entities/org-orem-police-department.md">Orem Police Department</a></span>, okay? And they said, "You know, we were overwhelmed on that day one," which makes sense. Everybody contacting, calling, someone says, "I have this," so it makes sense that he would be on the offense and getting them the footage. But the feds never reached out to him until the 15th. After <span id="ent-person-governor-cox-t-00-15-27"><a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a></span> said the investigation was over and they had the guy, the feds reached out to him and said, "Hey, you're the one who shot that footage."

I mean, saw the person getting into the shooting position. You never reached out to him until September 15th. Yeah, my friends, that looks to me like a cover-up, not like you're trying to get to the bottom of something, not with the amount of money that the feds have.

Now, right away you might ask, why is that happening? I can tell you in my experience, political organizations sometimes don't recognize that they are not like corporate organizations. And what I mean by that is not whether or not the organization is a corporate, but rather sometimes they get the wrong idea that they can sort of do things that people can do on Wall Street, right? Like if a CEO steps down from <span id="ent-org-wendys-t-00-16-52"><a href="/entities/org-wendys.md">Wendy's</a></span>, you could just replace that person as another CEO and nobody cares.

And leading up to that moment, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> had by and large completely removed himself outside of the organ of fundraising, which is to say that it wasn't something that he necessarily had his finger on. Of course, he always would show up for top donor meetings. He is the face of the company. But in terms of the accounting specifics, he trusted his lieutenants. Of course, something that big, you're clearing $100 million a year, you gotta have lieutenants and you have to trust those lieutenants. And of course, sometimes those leaders don't like one another.

We're gonna get things wrong. And we can only work with the information that's been given to us. And for whatever reason, it's very limited. So every time anything that I'm debunking here is just because I want to help focus his investigation. But so he presents an argument that you can see a muzzle flash. And there is one element of his video where he shows what he believes to be blood splatter as an entry point on <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-26-31"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) neck. ^t-00-26-31

So this video was created by a friend of mine who is a Marine. You'll see him here at the end. This is the angle. He is showing the shot coming from, showing where <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-27-30"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was sitting and the angle of the shot, which will correspond with this video here, which unfortunately we will blur out <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) face, but we will show what is necessary to prove that this was an entry and exit wound. So you'll see him circle the highlighted area right there, and you'll see the exit wound corresponding after a split second after, as it would from an entry and exit wound. So in this footage, you can clearly see that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> is shot from his back right and there is blood splatter coming out of the entry wound. ^t-00-27-30

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-28-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:28:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=1685" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, so what I can immediately help with, because I have so much footage and clearer footage of that, is that that's actually not blood splatter. And I was very surprised by this. It's his necklace. That is his necklace. And it was one of the things that struck me as odd. When I saw the back footage, and then I have clear footage from the front, and the necklace goes first. And if I'm looking at it, it looks like it breaks from here and then it comes up and it whips up. That is <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-28-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) necklace chain. So I hope that that sort of helps focus that. And I don't know if that helps change your opinion at all, but I wanted to add that. ^t-00-28-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-28-48.md" class="timestamp-link">00:28:48</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=1728" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The second thing is I wanted to show you a photo, a different angle of where that flash that he is looking at came from. Because the thing that I don't understand is that particular window doesn't open. So if you're saying it's inside—and I might be wrong, so you can see, and I hope I have this right. If I'm wrong, please let me know and I will adjust it immediately. But that window is from that zone, which they call like the Flag Hall, which is where that person actually shot the footage. He's on the other side of it, where we saw the person running across the roof. That's basically above the underpass. ^t-00-28-48

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-29-25.md" class="timestamp-link">00:29:25</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=1765" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And so you can see from this angle that those windows, I don't know if we have a more front-forward picture of that, <span id="ent-person-skylar-t-00-29-25"><a href="/entities/person-skylar.md">Skylar</a></span>; if we don't, it's okay. But from everything that I could see, those windows don't open. So if it's coming from inside, if that's where you're saying, and I had that location correctly—again, I'm happy to update this if I'm wrong—then we should see broken glass. So let me know if I'm right about that. I will say there was another piece, and this part I have not been able to debunk, but I am sending someone there to get me similar footage, which is when you discuss<span id="event-event-2025-09-09-suspicious-amazon-book-listing-appears-detailing-c-t-00-29-25"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-09-suspicious-amazon-book-listing-appears-detailing-c.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> a suspicious-looking bush. So I will let you, I will let Range Day Bro (Range Day Bro) present that theory. ^t-00-29-25

I want to take a look at this photo next. This guy's talking about this bush up here in the top left of this photo, and he zooms in on it and he's stating that it does look suspicious. It does look suspicious. It looks like there is a person right here and it looks like there is a rifle right here that that person is holding. ^t-00-29-53

This is a human skin tone right here, and this correlates with a human head and hair and a rifle in the exact kind of crucifix shape of an AR-15 with an optic on it mounted up. ^t-00-30-28

In the smaller, in the photos that I'm looking at today, the bush, you can kind of see through it, and in the image that you have, granted, it is grainy, it doesn't seem like you can see through it, so I am interested in that, and I am prodding that narrative, and I will let you know what I come up with, anyways. Again, the point of me doing that was just to help further direct your theories. Everybody is coming out with ideas, and I think that's great. Until the feds answer our questions, until we see more footage of what took place that day, all of us need to stay on top of it because we all sense that something is very wrong and we are not getting the truth. ^t-00-30-54

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-31-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:31:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=1897" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** One more thing that I'd like to share with you guys, you will recall yesterday during the comment section, we got a tip. A young woman that said that that doorbell footage was intentionally presented to the public only partially. And that the reality is that there was more footage which showed the person that they alleged, <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a>, walking with a woman who they don't know who that is, and that he changes clothes. So I'm not sure if there was more footage on the side of the house. There's another angle. But there is allegedly footage of <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-31-37"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span> changing clothes and he is with an unidentified woman. What I will say is I have established connection with that individual and it's a solid lead and it's only going to get more interesting in terms of who is involved in that cover-up locally, like a <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-31-37"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> person involved in that cover-up, which is another piece of this puzzle that I find to be fascinating. ^t-00-31-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-32-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:32:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=1942" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I will have more for you guys next week as we continue this. I always want to make sure that we give people an opportunity to respond and to answer what it is that we are putting out there and making sure that our reports are accurate. And I will have more for you on that next week. I do also want to address people who are inundating me, speaking about <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-32-22"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. And I think the reason why this was catalyzed was because of a fundraising email and text messages went out, and people found it to be distasteful and the fundraising off of his death. ^t-00-32-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-33-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:33:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=1985" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, first and foremost, the reason why I said, and I meant it genuinely, was to pray for <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-33-05"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> a couple of days ago, and I said she is stepping into a role: a CEO and the chairman of a company, a company that got bigger than <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-33-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> by everything that I am understanding, and just having been there, I saw it happening. And a company that she's going to have to learn in four seconds how this whole thing is, where it is a machine, okay? Those emails that you saw or checked, that was not written by <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a>. That will be an entire department. And these are emails, when you fundraise, I've had fundraising emails go out with my face and my name on them. They are not authored by <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a>. And I want you guys to know that, right? I just think it's like, I don't know, it just feels so unfair to me to assign the amount of pressure that is on her right now. She has not come out and said anything, to me, that makes her suspicious because I understand how that organ works. And I understand how people, when they are motivated by money, how they don't even think about these things. ^t-00-33-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-33-50.md" class="timestamp-link">00:33:50</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=2030" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It can be so gross. I mean, I have really gotten into arguments with people when I felt that they were using my face and representing things and I was getting pushback from the public. And I'm like, "I would have never done this. I would have never made that decision," and yet I'm gonna be the person that gets all the flack for the decision that you made. I've had those arguments. And so when I see this go out, irrespective of how you feel, you should know that those decisions are not made by <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-33-50"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. That's what it means to step into a company of that size and that scale. Okay, their focus is going to be something different, and she has had, I think, a tremendous amount of grace in the speech that she gave, which I thought was very inspiring, and we should similarly have grace, give her time to get her, A, first and foremost, the adjustment in her life. ^t-00-33-50

This is what she was doing. She was a mom. And <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-34-34"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was on the road, and these were <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) concerns. ^t-00-34-34

This was a faithful couple. This is a woman who consulted a priest and prayed when she felt that somebody had put a hex on her husband. And I just think everyone is being a little unfair by trying to assign so much ill will towards someone who hasn't done anything to warrant that, and I would have been the first person. If I felt that anything was there, I would have said something, truly in every capacity, and of course, I'm not in their marriage, but I know that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-35-18"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was very happy with <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-35-18"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>, and I know that <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> was a reason she was pushing <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, as women do, to really think through his ideas and think through what it was that he believed in one way or the other. By and large, I'm not going to sit and pretend that I had this relationship that I had with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, that I had with <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a>, of course, because neither he or I were married when we were hitting the road together, but she made him happy. And I just want you guys to know that. And so when you're putting stuff out there, just imagine that you're in her shoes. Imagine the size and the scale of that company. ^t-00-35-18

I mean, it is just such a crazy thing to make me guilty of investigating <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-38-08"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) murder. Like, it doesn't make any sense. Why would you investigate this? Because everybody's lying and we're not going to allow it. How about that? How about we're just not going to allow everyone to lie? Curated Journey writes, "Thank you, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-38-08"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, for the work that you have put into telling us the truth. ^t-00-38-08

God bless you." I just know that it's a ticking time bomb, right, before they're all exposed. And I think a financial audit is interesting. I think there were a lot of pastors that were around <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> who weren't exactly honest about whether or not they were financially motivated to say some certain things. You know, a lot of these organizations that are like Christian and Jews, organizations, funds that are coming together, have been interesting. You know, <span id="ent-concept-operation-mockingpastor-t-00-38-45"><a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingpastor.md">Operation Mockingpastor</a></span> is a real thing. And I know that at the end of the day, my hands are clean. My hands are absolutely clean, and so I don't care about people that are lying, because a lie always has to sprint, right? ^t-00-38-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K5GjF53bfN4/t-00-39-27.md" class="timestamp-link">00:39:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5GjF53bfN4&t=2367" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** A lie always has to sprint, and it's because it's fearful. It's very afraid, because people only have to hear the truth once to know that it is the truth. They have to hear the lie over and over. It begs repetition, a lie, but the truth doesn't care. And I am on the side of truth. So there's that. And also because my relationship with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-39-27"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was real, actually, a shout out to Taylor <span id="ent-person-taylor-lorenz-t-00-39-27"><a href="/entities/person-taylor-lorenz.md">Lorenz</a></span>. I obviously didn't watch what everybody else was saying about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> after his assassination because I was absolutely wrecked. It was a very tough week for me and I felt, I didn't even feel motivated to get out of bed. But Taylor <a href="/entities/person-taylor-lorenz.md">Lorenz</a> said, she's like, "Why do I feel like <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-39-27"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> is the only one—" I think she said this on X. I don't know if we have that tweet. I didn't ask you to pull it, but like she did say, "Why do I feel like <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> is the only one that actually cared about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>?" And she's the only tribute, because, I mean, that's the reality of politics. ^t-00-39-27

It's disgusting. It's a disgusting business. And <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-40-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> had a better stomach for it than I did. That's the reality. Yeah. She wrote, Taylor <span id="ent-person-taylor-lorenz-t-00-40-06"><a href="/entities/person-taylor-lorenz.md">Lorenz</a></span>, "It's wild that <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-40-06"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> is the only right-wing figure that I've seen posting in a way where she seems genuinely devastated to lose <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> as a friend." And it's because you can't fake it, and a lot of people are faking it right now. And it's difficult for me to process, which I have not, that he is actually gone. ^t-00-40-06

I have a picture of a screenshot supposedly verified. Yeah, I think <a href="/entities/org-amazon.md">Amazon</a> came out and said that it was a technical error because I guess you can adjust the dates. To be honest with you, I didn't look into it because there's a thousand ways that you could run with this, and I wanted to keep the pressure on the feds and I wanted to keep the pressure on getting as much information as I could about what took place on that day. But I know there are people that have made a lot of videos about that and so maybe I'll watch one of those. Brie Barrera (Brie Barrera) writes, "So glad that I caught you live today. ^t-00-40-46

Keep doing what you're doing. I love you." Reality is <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> changed my life. He really did. And I can't think about being in politics without <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. So that's why it feels like I have to accept that a piece of my life died, like years of my life died with him a little bit. And he was like one of the only, like, two people in politics that I can even stand because he was a real straight shooter with me. Thistle (Thistle) writes, "I wanted to ask your thoughts about the fact that quote-unquote 'notes on bullets' have been everywhere while our representatives are signing the bombs they drop on innocent people.

Yeah, it does. It does seem to bear their signature, like <span id="ent-person-nikki-haley-t-00-42-10"><a href="/entities/person-nikki-haley.md">Nikki Haley</a></span> signing bombs, people going over there to sign bombs that are going to be dropped and killing children. And so, yeah, it's been a weird new thing that everyone's doing, which is strange and feels very forced and fake to me. Totally agree.

I want the truth. If you're suggesting that you have the footage, please send it. You can send it to us, tips@candaceowens.com. We're inundated, guys, so please, if you can, just, if you're sending us tips, hopefully it's related to this investigation. Tips like, "Have you seen this video or <span id="ent-org-youtube-t-00-42-54"><a href="/entities/org-youtube.md">YouTube</a></span>, whatever," that's best reserved for, like, commenting on our <span id="ent-org-instagram-t-00-42-54"><a href="/entities/org-instagram.md">Instagram</a></span> and our social media pages; we'll see it there. The tips line we want to keep for actual tips related to this investigation. Not because I'm not so grateful that you guys are writing all these emails, but our tips inbox is getting so full that it's taking us a lot of time to go through it. So, yeah, I'm just trying to figure out how to filter so we know where to look for, "Hey, have you seen this video," versus, "Hey, we have an actual tip related to this investigation." Ben Auten (Ben Auten) writes, "Your interview with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-42-54"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> on <span id="ent-org-prageru-t-00-42-54"><a href="/entities/org-prageru.md">PragerU</a></span> showed up on my <a href="/entities/org-youtube.md">YouTube</a> algorithm.

Indeed, Ben (Ben Auten), indeed. You and Thistle (Thistle) both agree that that is very suspect. Like I said, it's starting to feel like a government signature a little bit, right? Miranda New (Miranda New) writes, "The anger and hate towards <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-43-37"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> is insane.

I assume <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> also thinks all of this is weird too, or she would have stopped you by now. All love." That is correct. <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> has my number. <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> actually recently started following me. It was another thing that they were like, "<a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> doesn't even follow <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-43-37"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>." Yeah, because I unfollowed everyone. When I announced my book, <span id="ent-work-blackout-t-00-43-37"><a href="/entities/work-blackout.md">Blackout</a></span>, I wanted to make it like a cool thing. ^t-00-43-37

I didn't start re-following people on all my social media pages. You will realize I'm like the only person you know that follows very few people, because I realized that I was engaging in social media in a way where I was hearing everybody else's ideas as opposed to sharing my own. And so it's just like the ridiculous angles that they've taken. But anyways, yeah, I have always been very clear. And that's another thing, if <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-44-20"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> was like, "Don't say anything," or if she lied about anything publicly, if she was like, "No, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-44-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> wasn't attending Mass." I would be like, "Okay, this is a little weird. Why is she massaging—" But she's not doing that. So I just feel that it's unfair. And people that are not used to constantly being on stage and presenting, like <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was, he had the it factor. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">d</a> get up there and the room was alive.

And I just, really, just feels to me like it's unfair. So I wanted to express that and just say that. And, yeah, anyways, next week we will not be on air tomorrow because last week was a rare Friday. And I like to have my Fridays off. But next week we will continue in earnest. Again, if you have something pertaining to the investigation, you were there, you were a police officer, you're in the government, you're a fed, and you are watching this, and you know that what I'm saying is true, ^t-00-45-03
