Sorry we are running a few minutes late. It takes so much time to investigate. We are such a small team, and we're constantly trying to make sure we're giving you guys the most accurate information. And, you know, it suddenly occurred to me after last week that I should maybe go back and find all of the original videos that were going viral on social media on 9/10, all the videos pertaining to the assassination, the people that were providing testimony as to what happened. And immediately we started to notice a pattern. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=32" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-00-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We noticed that a lot of the eyewitnesses and the people that were sharing those videos weren't exactly random college students from UVU, but rather people that either had strong ties to the government or to Turning Point USA altogether. So what gives? Also, later on, we're going to discuss Andrew Colvett, the PR agent, close friend of Charlie Kirk, who sat down with Alex Clark to answer questions pertaining to whether or not Charlie Kirk was converting to Catholicism and whether or not he was offered $150 million from Israel. Except I literally do not know who said either of those things, but we'll see how he responded. ^t-00-00-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=73" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-01-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Anyway, welcome back to Candice. So a couple of things that I want to say at the top to help focus some of these investigations that are going on, so many people that are sending us emails, and I see a lot of the chatter that's happening. First and foremost, no, Charlie was not wearing an earpiece. He was not wearing an earpiece. I saw some of that earlier footage and it looked like he was, and I was able to verify that actually what people think is an earpiece that's coming up is actually the necklace that he was wearing. ^t-00-01-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=117" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-01-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I also want you guys to know that he was not wearing a bulletproof vest. I was able to verify that, and there does seem to be a backstory there, somebody that had reached out who had been providing vests for Charlie and then no longer was providing vests for him. We're looking into that, but I wanted you to know those two facts. All right. Now, jumping into what I wanted to discuss today. We thought we should go back and re-examine all of the witnesses, okay, the people who spoke out to the press in the immediate aftermath of the killing. Obviously, that's what brought us to Caldera Engineering, the man who owned a couple of houses on that block. ^t-00-01-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=159" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-02-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And we found out that Caldera Engineering, a lot of the employees live on that block. And then, of course, I want to be clear, it doesn't make these people guilty of anything, but I thought it was interesting that I kept seeing this theme that none of these individuals were students of UVU. I guess that's just coincidental. Just to go back, we had already discussed Tiffany Barker and that early morning GMA interview, Good Morning America interview, that she did with her nieces. So I'm gonna show you that again to jog your memory because we have an update. ^t-00-02-39

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=193" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-03-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Take a listen. We're joined now by Tiffany Barker and her nieces, Elle Steel and Mia Grant, who were all in the audience yesterday afternoon. Thank you for joining us this morning. I know it's been a difficult day for all of you right now. Tiffany, let me begin with you. Just tell us what you remember about the scene yesterday. It was horrific. There was one shot that rang out, and everybody instantly looked around and then fell to the ground. People saw Charlie (Charlie Kirk) instantly get shot in the neck, and everybody fell to the ground. And then people started running and got run over, and I was with my family. We had 16 of us there, so five adults and like 11 children, and we instantly got separated. ^t-00-03-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=238" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-03-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** We're trying to find everybody, and we had amazing good Samaritans that grabbed kids. One took my niece and took her to her apartment. Somebody grabbed these two and my daughter and took them over to the tennis courts and stayed with them until I came. It was a super awful tragedy, and there were really good people that stood up and supported each other, and it was actually really powerful to see that. Elle and Mia, I can't imagine how scared you must have been yesterday. What can you tell us about what you all remember? Elle, you go first. So I remember hearing this thing. It was hard to know what it was, but then I saw it. ^t-00-03-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=279" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-04-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** And I saw blood everywhere, and it hit his artery, and then I just fell to the ground. I covered my head with my hands. And then I just started saying a prayer. And then we all ran. We sprinted away. And we ran away. And then we met at the tennis courts. And then we couldn't find anyone. It was just me, Mia, and then my other cousin, Bella. And then we were calling everyone. We didn't know what to do. And then we finally met up with them. And it was just so scary. I'm sure, Mia. ^t-00-04-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=322" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-05-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** I remember that we were like 15 feet away, and I thought, like, the shot was like a firecracker or something. It just didn't seem real. After that we went, like, behind where Charlie Kirk was, and then we were meeting up at the tennis courts and trying to find everyone and get everyone together, and Charlie Kirk was such a good guy. I'm gonna miss him so much. I've always watched all of his videos and I can't imagine what you went through yesterday. Thanks for sharing your stories this morning. ^t-00-05-22

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=362" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-06-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, so to update you and to remind you, I had mentioned that, first and foremost, Tiffany Barker is a part of a very political family, a very connected family in the region. The internet sleuths just were on it. Apparently there's a whole Reddit feed, and they were able to determine that not only is she connected to a a big political family that is high up in the LDS church, but she also forgot to mention, and maybe there wasn't time to mention, to be fair, that they knew Charlie, that the daughter had sung at Charlie Kirk's event. So it would have been something that I think I would have said, but again, sort of in the chaos, maybe in the next morning while the manhunt is going on, and in this sort of short stint of speaking to Good Morning America, you didn't have time to give those details. ^t-00-06-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=407" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-06-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, many people were curious mainly as to why the children were so descriptive regarding the artery. And Tiffany herself made a response video and addressed that question. And here is what she had to say. ^t-00-06-47

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=422" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-07-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** When we get in the car, we're stuck in the parking lot for like an hour and a half. My niece that was sitting right behind me in this car filmed Charlie getting shot. She was filming him speaking, and then she said, "Tiff, I have it on video." And I said, "Give me your phone. I don't want you to watch it. Give me the phone." So I took her phone, and the kids in the car with me, because they were closer down by my sister, had seen it really close up, and they saw how much Charlie bled. And we're all trying to process that. So I have an hour and a half in a car with my nieces and my two daughters, and I'm trying to help them through what we just saw. And they said, "Why did he bleed like that?" And I said, "There's an artery here. Maybe they hit an artery." I didn't know. We didn't know anything. And we're trying to get information. ^t-00-07-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=467" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-07-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** And then I get one text come in and said, "Glenn Beck said he's stable." And I told the kids, "You guys, okay, he's okay." They're taking turns praying for him. ^t-00-07-47

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=477" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-07-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So I connected with her after she made this video, and I wanted to specifically confirm and clarify two things. Again, not because I think her or her nieces had anything to do with the assassination, but because they were eyewitnesses. And I first and foremost wanted to know why Good Morning America reached out to them. It didn't seem to me that any of the videos she put out would have inspired a producer to reach out and say, "Can you be our eyewitness, provide eyewitness testimony to what took place?" And she intimated to me that actually it was a political connection. That was the reason it happened. Her sister ran as lieutenant governor alongside Phil Lyman, and actually Good Morning America ^t-00-07-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=520" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-08-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** reached out to Phil Lyman, and somehow that is how, instead of her, Phil Lyman or her sister, they ended up with her sister's children and her, because they were at the event. Now, regarding her, obviously you heard her explanation for why they mentioned the artery. I wanted to see if they even recorded that footage of Charlie or if they were close enough to see that. And my answer to that would be no on the basis of the footage that she gave me. She has not yet provided any footage that would suggest that her nieces saw that graphic or were able — anything that was that descriptive. I think this might've been just a little bit of, like, political insertion, so to speak. ^t-00-08-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=560" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-09-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Either way, I will say that kids being anywhere where a shot is ringing out is going to be traumatizing to a child. And, of course, she is being honest that through discussion, she is the one that kind of gave them the idea regarding the artery. But then I decided to take a look, or just including this, I was simultaneously taking a look at George Zinn, obviously. I wanted to track down George Zinn, because where was decoy boy sitting? Where exactly was he arrested? And I was able to discover something that I found to be quite odd. George Zinn was arrested in the same area, almost in the exact spot where Charlie's SUV departs, ^t-00-09-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=602" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-10-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** which to me, if you think somebody is the killer, you probably wouldn't send them in the direction of someone that they just shot. So I wanted to sort of prod that narrative a little bit further. So first I want you guys, in case you don't understand the layout of this particular — if we're calling it a stadium that he was sitting — amphitheater that Charlie was sitting, there is a tent, okay? And we're coming inward here. You can see that kind of half hexagon that's sitting there. Where that dot is, is where Charlie is sitting. And you can see there's like a bridge walkway. And Charlie has to walk underneath that to get to where his cars are, okay? So in front of him is the audience in that half hexagon. ^t-00-10-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=641" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-10-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And yep, we're coming inward right there, where you can see the mouse pointing, right there is where the SUVs were waiting, the SUV that carried Charlie. So they just went backwards from where the tent was, okay? And that underpass is right here. You can see a clear image of it, and you can actually see now we're in that underpass and are sitting — we are kind of where that SUV was. And you can see the back of the tent that Charlie was in. We were able to determine that it was approximately 40 seconds from the time that the shot rang off to when the security brings Charlie into the waiting SUV. ^t-00-10-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=681" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-11-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So they moved very quickly from shots to getting him into the SUV, obviously trying to save his life. Then approximately just one minute and eight seconds later, George Zinn is brought to that exact same territory. So Charlie departs, and about a minute and eight seconds later, we've got George Zinn, and he is in handcuffs. And I'm being — when I say a minute and eight seconds, I'm building in extra seconds. I'm trying to be as precise as possible. I am counting, and I'm watching everything. But I found it, again, odd that George Zinn is arrested in the exact same area that they just took Charlie, and it's fast, right? ^t-00-11-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=722" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-12-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And it's especially fast because we then found footage of George Zinn after the shot rings out, and we're gonna watch this. He's gonna get up, and people are dispersing everywhere, and he kind of calmly gets up and starts making his way down that stadium. You can see that here. We have the light on him. And his pants fall down by themselves. You can see that his pants did not — like, we were kind of working under the assumption that his pants fell down because, I don't know, the police were pulling him, but that's actually incorrect. They just fall down all by themselves. And you can see that a young man comes by to try to assist him. Okay, so it has nothing to do with the arrest. ^t-00-12-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=765" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-12-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, to be clear, when we see him sort of making his way down those stairs, we can actually approximate, because we did — like I said, we're counting seconds — that this happens, earliest, 30 seconds after the shot is fired. And that clip that you just watched is about 20 seconds long. It's about a full 50 seconds, and we know that George Zinn is still sitting — is still standing right there, okay? So somehow George Zinn needs to get from where you just saw him, where his pants fall, to handcuffs in the SUV zone in about 40 seconds flat. ^t-00-12-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=810" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-13-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Again, that's very fast. We were able to find the footage of him walking down. He just walks down. Like, you see him. He just is walking down the stairs, and he has his hat in his hand, and he starts waving, and he's going toward the left side of the tent. If you're behind the tent looking forward, like if you have Charlie's view, he is then going to kind of go down and he walks to the left side of the tent. So I wanted to show you this, like, second timeline that I put together, because this just lets you know what happened in the immediate after — in the immediate aftermath. Charlie — I mean, Charlie, I'm not sure if I told you to pull that. Can you see that little timeline that we have? ^t-00-13-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=855" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-14-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Yeah, no worries. I'll give you a couple of seconds. But we have, you know, Charlie gets shot. Forty seconds later, Charlie's brought to the SUV. Ten seconds after that is where George Zinn's pants fall down in the middle of the departing crowd. And then a minute and 15 seconds after that shot rings out, George Zinn is waving his hat near the left side of the tent. And then at the minute 48 second mark, George Zinn is in handcuffs and he is being pulled near where Charlie's SUV has just departed. It's very quick, okay? All of this takes place in under two minutes. Not the vibe that I got, obviously, when you are behind ^t-00-14-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=894" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-14-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** your cell phone and you're getting all of these updates and you're trying to follow all the X accounts to see who has the newest information. I certainly was not under the impression that it all took — that all took place in just two minutes. So then that photo starts circulating online. You know which photo I'm talking about. It's George Zinn, and he's bent down, and he is in handcuffs, and that goes viral. And so I wanted to get to the bottom of that, who actually shared that photo of George Zinn in handcuffs. And I was able to determine that that was somebody who lived in Utah, who advertises with Turning Point USA. ^t-00-14-54

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=930" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-15-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And when he did some press about it, he didn't mention that connection to Turning Point USA, but he for sure advertises with them or has advertised in the past. Again, things are moving unbelievably quickly, and I have now watched that footage from many angles. And there's another thing that happens in the immediate aftermath that stands out to me. There is what I assume must be a donor, a sponsor of some description, or an employee of a donor/sponsor. And he tries to get close to Charlie after the shots are fired, but not in, like, a rescue way. There was already, like, a team of men that fly in. ^t-00-15-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=971" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-16-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And then he gets there, and I'm not sure what the intention is. I don't know if it's just, like, obviously you're shocked. Maybe you're trying to be helpful, who knows? The security guard just kind of shoos him away immediately. And then what the guy does is he sort of just stands up, and he takes out — like, walks to the side and takes out a cell phone. So I'm going to show you that. That's — he's right there in the blue shirt. And, like, he I don't — sends a text. As I'm watching the footage, it goes on a little bit longer. Like, sends a text, takes a photo, not entirely clear what's being done there, but it just sort of stood out to me, like, in the middle of the chaos, seeing that. ^t-00-16-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=1012" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-16-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I would really like to know who that is, because we had received a ton of messages from current employees at Turning Point that had mentioned that company. He's wearing a shirt that says WireFi. And according to the sources at Turning Point, it was a... rather young company, meaning that the company hasn't been around for very long, that came out in a really big way in terms of sponsorship for this tour. And that's common sense, given the fact that WireFi, you will notice in the clips of the event, is the backdrop advertiser that's behind Charlie. So maybe this person came because it's his first event of the season and they are the major sponsors. ^t-00-16-52

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=1053" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-17-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Like I said, judging by the placement and the fact that a WireFi donor or employee is there, we can draw the conclusion that they sponsored this very event. And I'm interested in knowing who that is. So if you've got any answers for that, please let me know, because I would like to see what he took a picture of and to get his perspective on things. Certainly would like to identify who that individual is. I then decided to try to track down the origin of a video that actually no press has been done on. It was the video of the — I assumed it was a student, and I think, you know, we shouldn't make assumptions — who recorded the shooter on the roof. Remember? That started going viral. ^t-00-17-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=1097" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-18-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You remember the footage, and there's a guy that's kind of speaking in the background. We can show you that footage right now. Let's take a look at that footage that we're referring to. ^t-00-18-17

You'd think he'd already be in place. You would think that. So there's somebody on the roof right there, just saying. He just ran from, uh, over — where's my finger? Well, from over there, ran in, and now he's right there, just saying. ^t-00-18-27

And what I mean by that is it was very simple for me to find the account that published the video and made the video viral. And when I reached out to that individual, they were immediately responsive. And I said, hey, where did you get this footage from? And the individual said to me, a friend of a friend's family member sent it. So I'm like, okay, you're telling me the chain is already twice removed. I said, do you know who took the video? And he said, no, I don't know who took the video. ^t-00-18-49

I said, so your friend who sent you this video just stops answering you, and he then sends me a screenshot of a conversation that they're having on an app that I don't recognize, right? So we are prodding that, and he has been responsive, so I'm sure he'll tell me what app this is. And sure enough, the person says, well, there were two people actually who took that footage, which obviously is impossible, but there are two people that were involved in taking that footage, and he sends him two numbers. And those two numbers were both Chicago-based. ^t-00-19-24

Like, why are these two Chicago-based numbers? It was very weird and very sketchy. So then I have a guy who's on the ground in Utah, and I asked him, a student, to start looking around, fishing around, and seeing if he could figure out who took that photo. Again, operating under the assumption that this must have been a student that was walking by the Pelosi Center. And he comes back and he says, I have a number of an individual. This is allegedly the person who took the footage. And I said, do you know that person? Is this a UVU student? He said, no. And I said, well, where did you get this number from? ^t-00-20-08

And Aaron is the one that gave me this number. You know, I don't know Aaron even, but, like, he's the person that gave it to me. So then I said, can I have Aaron's number? He gives me Aaron's number, and Aaron also has a Chicago number. So I'm getting from somebody on the ground, and I'm getting from this person on Twitter, that all of these Chicago numbers are involved, and that's not making sense to me. And I then tried to text that number of the person who allegedly shot the footage. We didn't get a response until today. We finally got a response from that person. I hop on the phone with him. He explains that it wasn't just him. ^t-00-20-49

Neither of them are students of UVU. One of them said he was a student at BYU, which is Brigham Young University. And he's like, well, I didn't take the footage, but my friend took the footage, and his friend does not have a does not have a Chicago-based number. So I am confused, and we ask if he'd be willing to send us the footage and to get us on the phone with the person who actually took the footage. I had a conversation with that individual after all this running around, hence the reason these episodes take so long to put together, because you're calling people, you're waiting for responses and... ^t-00-21-33

I am working to quadruple confirm exactly who this individual is. But he was very much — and maybe this is a poor way of saying it — a straight shooter. Said, yes, you know, I have a training — I don't want to give too many identifying details here, but this person himself has a lot of experience with guns and knows guns and, you know, helps to train people in that sort of a capacity. And said that they observed that individual. The FBI saying that the shooter dropped onto the roof at 12:15 ^t-00-22-15

He said earliest it was 12:22 that the individual ran across, set up, took the shots. And I said, well, you must have been there, because he then sends me the — I wanted to see all of the metadata of when he took that footage. And the metadata begins at 12:22 and goes into 12:23, the very minute that Charlie gets shot. And he says, yeah, I saw the shots. I had just stopped recording about 20 seconds before the shot rang out. And he said that he told them a description of what the shooter looked like. ^t-00-23-00

I said, was he wearing jeans? He said, no. Actually, this person was dressed in tactical gear, and he was wearing a face mask. And he said, according to him — like I said, he has a lot of experience with guns — that this person looked to him like a foreign agent. I don't know if he's wearing all black, how he got that, but he said there's no... He was very certain that this person was skilled, knew exactly what he was doing, and was highly trained, like a highly trained assassin, so to speak. Okay. He then says something else. ^t-00-23-37

I observed this person with my eyes. You have the complete wrong description. Person you're looking for is wearing tactical gear and is obviously young, because I watched him sprint back after taking the shot. I saw this with my own two eyes. And for whatever reason, that never made its way out that we can see of a description of a person wearing tactical gear. We're kind of left with this idea that he was wearing the now infamous veteran's shirt with the American flag on it and some jeans. So he also said something ^t-00-24-18

And I'm going to read you directly a text message that he sent me, again, protecting his identity. He said, "Watching the video of the impact, hearing the sharp crack instead of a big hunting rifle's boom, and seeing what looked like a shorter rifle platform, albeit with the absence of the shape of a standard 30-round magazine, the assassin may have used a 10- or 20-round magazine, only expecting to shoot once or twice. ^t-00-24-55

Of course, I don't have access to any autopsy reports like you might, but if they found small shards of copper rather than one large copper-coated lead slug, that's the gun and bullet I would expect was used." So I wanted to share that because I know that a part of this entire thing was our upset at kind of being taken for a ride by the FBI. It makes no sense to me that they wouldn't share those details immediately while this manhunt was taking place. ^t-00-25-36

And I would say, again, assuming this guy's story checks out, and it seems to me that it did, and he sent us the data and we looked at the metadata that he was the person who took that video, it doesn't make sense to me. It literally makes no sense to me that they would obfuscate these details when they're speaking to the public. ^t-00-26-17

I don't know what to make of all of this. I guess what we make every single episode is the fact that they're just lying to us about everything, about literally everything. Anyways, you guys, I want to get to some of the responses and answers that were given by Andrew Colvett, who is a PR agent for Turning Point USA. He sat down with Alex Clark and addressed some... some of the things that have been going viral, particularly as it pertains to taking down the footage in the minutes following the shooting, having somebody on their team take down that footage. You might be curious as to what he had to say. ^t-00-26-57

Preborn — I've watched too many people who I am close to be vilified for standing up for truth. I've felt the sting of injustice, but I've also felt something else, which is courage. I think most of us are done playing defense. We don't want to water down what we believe to be palatable, because silence is not kindness, it's actually just consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds lives that are being ended before they even take their first breath. If we are going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like that. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For $28, that is what it costs to give an ultrasound, a free ultrasound, to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion. Just $28 will help her see the life that is growing inside of her and give her truth that the culture won't. So you shouldn't sit this one out. You shouldn't wait for permission. ^t-00-27-42

You give $28. You can also give 10 times that if you want to. This is the line that we should defend and stand on: standing for truth, standing for what is right, and saving lives from abortion, standing firm in the gospel. Again, it is preborn.org/Candice to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also want to tell you guys about Cozy Earth, because you work hard, you fight for your family, your values, and your future. So when the workday ends, your five to nine should be about one thing, which is comfort. That's why I love Cozy Earth. Cozy Earth is on a mission to make your evenings and every moment that you spend at home the most comfortable part of your day. ^t-00-28-26

They're soft, breathable, and temperature regulating, which is why I can't go a night without using them. Cozy Earth offers more than just clothing. They have perfected their bubble cuddle blanket. Their blanket offers a combination of comfort and style with its distinctively textured bubble design, intricately woven from ultra-soft fibers. These blankets are an absolute must.

CozyEarth.com, use code Candice, and you will elevate your downtime with Cozy Earth. All right, so Andrew Colvett, obviously he's been a topic of discussion. He did the Charlie show with him. And so he sat next to Charlie throughout all of that. They were very close. He's also the PR agent for Turning Point USA. And he's also the one that issued the statement, therefore, about what is now being termed the other magic bullet — and magic bullet being the first one, JFK. It kind of seems like when the government might be involved, you know, bullets tend to have magical properties. ^t-00-29-50

That's just how it works in PR. And I'm sure there are lawyers involved as well. He went onto the Alex Clark podcast. Now it was kind of billed, I think people were expecting — but actually Alex Clark never did say that — that Erica Kirk was going to be the one to answer questions pertaining to Charlie and to clear up some rumors about his personal life. She teased that you were going to get unfiltered answers to burning questions like, quote, "Was Charlie converting to Catholicism?" Again, I have no idea who said he was converting to Catholicism. ^t-00-30-29

Also, she was going to answer, did he take $150 million from Israel? Again, not something that we said on this show. And again, like I told you, they're going to address the SD cards. Now, I was very clear, and I am still kind of shocked by the reaction from the evangelical community. It was totally — just, it didn't make any sense to me, A, because Erica's a cradle Catholic. I said Charlie was attending the Mass, because he was. I said Charlie was praying the Rosary, because he was. And I said that as a Catholic, of course, I was egging him to take the next step. Who wouldn't? Of course, you want — if you ^t-00-31-12

That totally makes sense. And it wasn't said in an evil capacity. I said the joke that I said to Charlie, "Take the next step. You're too smart to be a Protestant." That's a descriptor of our relationship. We were like brother and sister. It's said in humor and in jest. Hey, guys, I was Protestant like five minutes ago. And so I felt like people were looking for reasons to be offended, and wanted somebody to come out and slap that down and say, no, he wasn't attending the Mass and, you know, kind of caging this like it was a war for Charlie. It's like, no, he never took the first step in converting. But I think going to the Mass and praying the Rosary, obviously, it's going to get Catholics excited. ^t-00-31-52

So she herself had said no. Yeah, and I think Charlie, one of the things Charlie really hated — worshiping in, like, a gym, you know, or some sort of kind of blank space that you just turn into church. I don't — there's no problem. He didn't have a problem with the act of that. He just didn't prefer it. And he loved, again, the ritual, the ancient ^t-00-33-23

So he had some really big theological hangups with that. You can go check the videos out, him debating with Michael Knowles, you know, in good fun. I mean, they were dear friends, but they loved kind of debating the whole Protestant versus Catholic thing. So I didn't lie about anything. And yeah, he was attending Mass. And so usually if you are ritualistically attending Mass, meaning he liked the ritual — I'm not sure what that means. I don't understand what we're doing. It just feels weird. And to say he converted to Christian — Catholics are Christian. So he said, I think Andrew said, I converted to Christianity, I went from being a cradle Catholic. And yeah, ^t-00-34-06

And there's no dispute there. I never said he started converting to Catholicism. I said that the Catholics were kind of thinking, you know, "Take the next step, Charlie, take the next step." And I don't think it was just architectural for him, far be it from me to speak on behalf of whether he was just attending because he liked the architecture. I think it was a little deeper than that. And I agree that he did have some hangups, but that's kind of — when you make that thing of, like, he didn't really like having church in a gym, that's a step, right? ^t-00-34-48

It's a journey. Nobody was trying to start a Catholic versus Protestant war. I just shared something about, you know, my final conversations with him. And a lot of the conversations were about faith towards the end. Yeah, that's it. Not a big deal. Anyways, then they get to the second portion of something that I didn't say. Nobody said the number 150 million, or I didn't say the number. Tucker (Tucker Carlson) didn't. I don't know where the 150 million number came from. If I'm being honest, I said 150 million was what Benjamin Netanyahu spent on Operation Mockingpastor.

Said no to the — whatever that check was. What was that that they were handing out? Stimulus check. Yeah, the PPE loans, right? I always get PPP and PPE mixed up. Yeah, but it was a good amount of money that, at the time, we could have used. He put out a company statement saying, you know, this was tempting for sure, but we're going to say no.

And every country, if they're going to influence people — if you're Qatar, if you're Iran and you want to lobby on behalf of those countries — you have to be registered under FARA so we know where that money is going into. If you have — literally stands for Foreign Agents Registration, right? If you have foreign agents in America that are working on your behalf, we would be able to see that. But there's this magic carve-out for Israel, right? So when you say, like, was he going to take Israeli money, it's kind of a working around it, right? Do I think that in the Turning Point accounts it would have said Benjamin Netanyahu wrote, you know, wants this money to go to... probably not. Do I know for a fact that there are foreign agents working on behalf of Israel that gave money to Turning Point? ^t-00-37-30

The question is whether it's Bill Ackman, whether it's Bob Schulman, whether it's a ton of the donors who write big checks and are pressuring him to say stuff. Was a large sum of money offered to Charlie Kirk to take Turning Point to the next level — not that it wasn't a very high level — to the next level, with the guarantee that he would represent their current perspectives and the things that were going on, and did Charlie Kirk refuse that? I maintain what I said, that that happened and Charlie turned the money down. I hope that makes sense. I do want to add on to that, that I do have concerns, ^t-00-38-14

I have, rather, hopes that Erica, who is taking on this huge step of being the chairman and the CEO, that she has someone in her corner that she really trusts. And what I mean is that I am not equipped to be the CEO of my little tiny company, okay? And I realized that — how much it involves to understand accounting, to understand how people can create LLCs, spin off of LLCs, how money can be hidden and pushed into different directions and into vehicles that you don't understand. It takes a person that is sort of trained to have that business mind. ^t-00-38-58

I just don't actually even care to have that business mind — more than anything else, not that I couldn't learn it. But I know with a company at that size, Erica is going to really need to have someone who is very much in her corner. It breaks my heart that she doesn't have Charlie. Charlie would be exactly the kind of person. It's the beauty of a partnership, and they had a beautiful partnership. But I worry, I really do worry, and I just wanted to express that openly to you guys. I'm concerned about that for some reason, and I guess the best thing to do is just ask everybody to pray for Erica. Pray that she has the clarity to understand and have people around her who are being honest with her, because I would not want to be in her position right now. ^t-00-39-40

And here is what Andrew had to say about the Turning Point affiliate employee, somebody adjacent to Turning Point, who removed the SD cards from the camera that was behind Charlie in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.

Was it just in shock and just thinking, like, this is what we do, and just not thinking it's a crime scene? I think massive shock. I think there's been some stories about the SD cards or whatever. That was because, even in the shock, there was an understanding that the proximity of those cameras were, A, going to be evidence, and they wanted to make sure they didn't get stolen out of the cameras. But, B, they didn't want anybody to run in. I mean, there was those videos of the kid running and grabbing the hats.

She's a great friend, you know. Look, I don't agree with everything Candice says, but you know what I don't do? I don't stop being friends with people just because people morally blackmail me. I don't do that, and you shouldn't either. Look, I have different views on things as Candice. I have different views on Israel than Candice. I have different views on a lot of geopolitics. But honestly, I traveled the country with Candice. I went to her wedding. I saw her meet her husband. I went to Israel with Candice, which is a fun story I'll tell you at some point. But what I don't like is when people demand, you must stop being friends with somebody. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's a left-wing tactic. Don't do that. I'm not saying you do that, but other people do that. We should never resort to that.

My advice to all of you, you might not like somebody, but never tell somebody like me to stop being friends with somebody on an interpersonal level just because of disagreement.

Like, I didn't — none of my kids were vaccinated, and people thought it was wacky. But before I got there, the lefty moms, left-stream moms, were actually the ones that were, like, very on it with, like, what are these products? And yeah, that was like a weird place.

And so Trump (Donald Trump) coming out and making a statement and calling this stuff poison and putting out a list of things that don't need to happen, I'm like, wow, is he watching "Shot in the Dark"?

We want no aluminum in the vaccine. The MMR, I think, should be taken separately. This is based on what I feel — the mumps, measles. And the three should be taken separately. It seems to be that when you mix them, there could be a problem. So there's no downside in taking them separately. In fact, they think it's better. So let it be separate. The chicken pox is already separate, because when that got mixed in — I guess they made it for a while — it really was bad. So they make chicken pox individually there. ^t-00-47-40

So there's no downside in doing it. It's not like, oh, if you do it, bad things... No, it's only good side. And it may not have that much of an impact, but it may have a big impact. So let those be taken separately. And then hepatitis B is sexually transmitted. There's no reason to give a baby that's almost just born hepatitis B. So I would say, wait till the baby is 12 years old and formed and take hepatitis B.

That's why they want you to either abort your offspring. If you have your offspring, they want them to be fat, addicted to drugs, and filled with pharmaceuticals and vaccines. That's the reality. And we have to say that, we have to declare that boldly, because now they want our speech because people are waking up. But what you're seeing Trump say is a reaction to the amount of moms that are pulling their kids out of the public school system. And I want to be clear, not just public, private, okay?

And that is why I am obsessed with Sauna Space. You've seen those red light panels that are trendy, but this is totally different. It's the Glow Infrared Therapy Light from Sauna Space. It helps with screen fatigue, and it's amazing for your skin. In the morning, it's like natural sunlight — warm, comforting — and it resets your body clock. And at night, it helps you relax and get ready for a seriously deep sleep. You can even use it as a pain relief on the sore muscles or cramps if you have them. And the real game changer is their Fire Light Sauna. It's portable and it's powerful. You're getting red light therapy and an infrared sauna all in one. ^t-00-51-14

Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends in American Financing, but maybe hesitated because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. Well, there is good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment, giving you the peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There are no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, 800-795-1210. ^t-00-52-43

What do you get? What's the upside of lying about something? And so, yeah, I think they are finding out, and we have remained very committed to getting to the bottom of this. Jenna V. writes, "Thank you for fighting so hard for that precious human being, Charlie Kirk." He was amazing. I mean, I could say it a thousand times. There truly would not be me without Charlie. And I know that I held his head up during tough times, you know, when you are climbing and fighting through politics, that early phase. You're unknown. You go through a lot of really tough times and you're tired. And similarly, he held my head up during a lot of tough times. And like I said, reading the messages of me — yeah, while we were sick, tired, we just always made it work. And he built that company. ^t-00-54-56

And I... I don't know why, but it just sickens me to hear any lies or misrepresentations. It just makes me so angry. But I know that that's something that I have to deal with, my choice emotion. I guess that's my vice, is I always have to pull myself back consciously from wanting vengeance. And I don't want vengeance right now. I just want Christ. Christ is King because Christ is truth. And I want the truth about what happened. And we're not getting it at that moment. Miriam writes, "British Muslim here. Love the work you're doing and I so stand by the point that this is good versus evil, slaves versus the elites. Yes, you are amazing and I keep you and your family in my prayers." ^t-00-55-40

Truly, the prayers work. They are working, and I needed them a lot last week. I feel... better this week, which is one thing. I feel more focused in this, in many ways. And like I said, it arrived to me — something I really needed to hear — when Erica said that it was quick. That was eating me up inside, like not knowing that answer. Previously, Temp writes, "They didn't kill Charlie, only his physical form. Of course, Charlie lives on with the Lord our God in heaven forever and evermore." Yeah, we know that, but you just miss the person, you know? That's what I haven't accepted yet, is that Charlie Kirk is actually gone from this earth. ^t-00-56-22

It just makes me really sad. And sometimes the sadness, like I said, just turns into anger. And I know that that will kind of — it will change with time. I know that you're never — a year on, however you feel a year on, it will be better. And so I hold onto that. Carl writes, "My wife and I love your show. Gang gang. Thanks for always asking questions. You've opened a lot of people's eyes up to the obvious lying that is going on around us." That is the point of this. I did an interview earlier with a journalist, and she kind of said, what do you think, you know, podcasting getting big, what does it signify? It signifies that we don't believe the establishment anymore. And the establishment seems to be growing more radical, and they want to control speech as if that's going to make us believe them more. ^t-00-57-05

Mary Kelly writes, "I love you, Candice. You are my Joan of Arc. Prayers for you and your family. Flame of Love Rosaries." Thank you so much for that. Chris writes, "Do we know who paid for the crime scene demolition? The pavers that were so quickly put down. Normally universities don't have expendable cash. Our rosaries are with you in prayer and Mass." Thank you so much. John 12:23, he ends that with, "We love you." And that says that's from Michelle. Maybe it's Michelle and Chris. I don't know if that's another path that we could pursue. I feel like I thought it was the feds who did that? I could be incorrect. A feeling is not a fact. So I will explore that. ^t-00-57-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3513" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:58:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-58-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's a good question. MC writes, "There is a call on the police scanner after Charlie got shot, saying they were looking for someone wearing jeans, a black shirt, a black mask, and a black vest, carrying a long rifle." I heard that. I need to go over that scanner. And then they took that scanner — when they realized that 3,000 people had suddenly tuned in, they decided to privatize everything. But that is true, which is why we naturally have to ask the question, why did the public never hear that description if you only had one eyewitness testimony as to what that person was wearing? And we know that you have clear footage. Obviously you have tons of clear footage. Why didn't you release it? Was it because we were gonna see somebody in tactical gear that looked foreign, or we were going to be able to identify the person further and realize that it wasn't Tyler Robinson? I maintain that Tyler Robinson is one piece of this, and a lot more people are involved. ^t-00-58-33

Milana writes, "Hi, Candice, I wait for your live every day and dread the weekends. What curriculum do you recommend if I were to homeschool my kids?" OK, so we are first doing a trial curriculum for the first time next week. So I will let you know. We're kind of editing it and making it our own, using a classical mixed in with Montessori approach because of the age of my children, and obviously working in our faith, starting with a morning prayer ^t-00-59-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3596" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:59:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-59-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** and trying to say, okay, what can we teach them? Because I have found that my son really loves Mass, the portions of Mass where he knows what's going on. So I'm like, well, we need to do more of that. And obviously, we go to the Latin Mass, which makes it a bit trickier for him. But I'm like, well, why not? Can they learn a Latin prayer? So I wanted to get involved, because I'm still a young Catholic student in many ways, and teach them that, because it would be, you know, also an opportunity for me to learn as if I was a preschooler. We are still working on that, and I will definitively share all that information publicly, because I want to inspire moms to take their kids out of schools — all of them. ^t-00-59-56

What they want your kids to do is to do drugs. They want to get them addicted to pornography and screens, and the effort is to turn them into slaves. Take your kids out of all the schools. That would be my advice. Lastly, lover of light writes, "Thank you for all that you do. I know this is a serious time, but don't forget to share some of those funny personal stories like your daughter forgetting her makeup. Love you, Candice." Yeah, she is — that one's got quite the imagination. My daughter, she — my favorite thing that kids do at this age is the filibuster. If you think congressmen are good, you got to try to get a toddler to sleep and try to leave their room and the things that they come up with. ^t-01-00-38

And I said, sweetie, I don't think that's a thing. And then she just sort of went, "Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Okay, we'll move on from that anyways." Yeah, it is another thing that always gets you through really tough times, obviously, is you just be around children. They are such a light. They really are such a light in this world. And I want everyone to have kids, and I want them to have lots of them, because I know the government doesn't want us to have any. They want to make our tribes smaller because they want to rule over us. And anyways, we'll have more for you tomorrow. Thank you guys so much. ^t-01-01-20
