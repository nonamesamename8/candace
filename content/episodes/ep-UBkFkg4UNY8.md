Happy Tuesday. Sorry we are running a few minutes late. It takes so much time to investigate. We are such a small team, and we're constantly trying to make sure we're giving you guys the most accurate information. And, you know, it suddenly occurred to me after last week<a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-tiffany-barker-and-nieces-interviewed-on-good-morn.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2025-09-11-tiffany-barker-and-nieces-interviewed-on-good-morn-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-tiffany-barker-and-nieces-interviewed-on-good-morn.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> that I should maybe go back and find all of the original videos that were going viral on social media on 9/10, all the videos pertaining to the assassination, the people that were providing testimony as to what happened. And immediately we started to notice a pattern. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-00-32.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:32</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=32" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="claim-claim-99fc2cbef55e-t-00-00-32">We noticed that a lot of the eyewitnesses and the people that were sharing those videos weren't exactly random college students from <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-00-32"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span>, but rather people that either had strong ties to the government or to <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-32"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> altogether<a href="/claims/claim-99fc2cbef55e.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. So what gives? Also, later on, we're going to discuss <a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew</a> <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-00-32"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Kolvet</a></span>, the PR agent, close friend of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-32"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, who sat down with Alex <span id="ent-person-alex-clark-t-00-00-32"><a href="/entities/person-alex-clark.md">Clark</a></span> to answer questions pertaining to whether or not <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was converting to Catholicism and whether or not he was offered $150 million from <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-00-32"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>. Except I literally do not know who said either of those things, but we'll see how he responded. ^t-00-00-32

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-01-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=73" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Anyway, welcome back to Candace. So a couple of things that I want to say at the top to help focus some of these investigations that are going on. So many people are sending us emails, and I see a lot of the chatter that's happening. <span id="claim-claim-362ce33f13b8-t-00-01-13">First and foremost, no, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-13"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was not wearing an earpiece<a href="/claims/claim-362ce33f13b8.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. He was not wearing an earpiece. I saw some of that earlier footage, and it looked like he was, and I was able to verify that actually what people think is an earpiece that's coming up is actually the necklace that he was wearing. ^t-00-01-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-01-57.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:57</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=117" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="claim-claim-16e5464ec293-t-00-01-57">I also want you guys to know that he was not wearing a bulletproof vest<a href="/claims/claim-16e5464ec293.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. I was able to verify that, and there does seem to be a backstory there. Somebody had reached out who had been providing vests for <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-57"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and then no longer was providing vests for him. We're looking into that, but I wanted you to know those two facts. All right. Now, jumping into what I wanted to discuss today. We thought we should go back and re-examine all of the witnesses, okay? The people who spoke out to the press in the immediate aftermath of the killing. Obviously, that's what brought us to <span id="ent-org-caldera-engineering-t-00-01-57"><a href="/entities/org-caldera-engineering.md">Caldera Engineering</a></span>, the man who owned a couple of houses on that block. <span id="claim-claim-bdfd1b018f9b-t-00-01-57">And we found out that <a href="/entities/org-caldera-engineering.md">Caldera Engineering</a>—a lot of the employees live on that block<a href="/claims/claim-bdfd1b018f9b.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. ^t-00-01-57

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-02-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=159" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And then, of course, I want to be clear: it doesn't make these people guilty of anything, but I thought it was interesting that I kept seeing this theme that none of these individuals were students of <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-02-39"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span>. I guess that's just coincidental. Just to go back, we had already discussed <span id="ent-person-tiffany-peterson-barker-t-00-02-39"><a href="/entities/person-tiffany-peterson-barker.md">Tiffany</a></span> Barker and that early morning <a href="/entities/work-good-morning-america.md">GMA</a> interview—<span id="ent-work-good-morning-america-t-00-02-39"><a href="/entities/work-good-morning-america.md">Good Morning America</a></span> interview—that she did with her nieces. So I'm gonna show you that again to jog your memory because we have an update. Take a listen. ^t-00-02-39

There was one shot that rang out, and everybody instantly looked around and then fell to the ground. People saw <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-27"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> instantly get shot in the neck, and everybody fell to the ground. And then people started running and got run over, and I was with my family. We had 16 of us there, so five adults and like 11 children, and we instantly got separated. We're trying to find everybody, and we had amazing good Samaritans that grabbed kids. One took my niece and took her to her apartment. Somebody grabbed these two and my daughter and took them over to the tennis courts and stayed with them until I came. It was a super awful tragedy, and there were really good people that stood up and supported each other, and it was actually really powerful to see that. ^t-00-03-27

It was hard to know what it was, but then I saw it. And I saw blood everywhere, and it hit his artery, and then I just fell to the ground. I covered my head with my hands. And then I just started saying a prayer. And then we all ran. We sprinted away. And we ran away. And then we met at the tennis courts. And then we couldn't find anyone. It was just me, Mia (Mia Grant), and then my other cousin, Bella. And then we were calling everyone. ^t-00-04-25

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-05-54.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:54</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=354" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, so to update you and to remind you, I had mentioned that, first and foremost, <span id="claim-claim-dae4635266df-t-00-05-54"><span id="ent-person-tiffany-peterson-barker-t-00-05-54"><a href="/entities/person-tiffany-peterson-barker.md">Tiffany</a></span> Barker is a part of a very political family, a very connected family in the region.<a href="/claims/claim-dae4635266df.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> The internet sleuths just were on it. Apparently there's a whole Reddit feed, and they were able to determine that not only is she connected to a big political family that is high up in the <span id="ent-org-lds-church-t-00-05-54"><a href="/entities/org-lds-church.md">LDS church</a></span>, but she also forgot to mention—and maybe there wasn't time to mention, to be fair—that they knew <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-54"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, that the daughter had sung at <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s event. So it would have been something that I think I would have said, but again, sort of in the <span id="ent-work-chaos-t-00-05-54"><a href="/entities/work-chaos.md">chaos</a></span>, maybe in the next morning while the manhunt is going on, and in this sort of short stint of speaking to <span id="ent-work-good-morning-america-t-00-05-54"><a href="/entities/work-good-morning-america.md">Good Morning America</a></span>, you didn't have time to give those details. ^t-00-05-54

And <span id="ent-person-tiffany-peterson-barker-t-00-06-32"><a href="/entities/person-tiffany-peterson-barker.md">Tiffany</a></span> (<a href="/entities/person-tiffany-peterson-barker.md">Tiffany</a> Barker) herself made a response video and addressed that question. And here is what she had to say. ^t-00-06-32

**🎤 Tiffany Barker**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-06-54.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:54</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=414" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Tiffany Barker:** When we get in the car, we're stuck in the parking lot for like an hour and a half. My niece that was sitting right behind me in this car filmed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-54"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> getting shot. She was filming him speaking, and then she said, "Tiff, I have it on video." And I said, "Give me your phone. I don't want you to watch it. Give me the phone." So I took her phone, and the kids in the car with me—because they were closer down by my sister—had seen it really close up, and they saw how much <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> bled. And we're all trying to process that. So I have an hour and a half in a car with my nieces and my two daughters, and I'm trying to help them through what we just saw. And they said, "Why did he bleed like that?" And I said, "There's an artery here. ^t-00-06-54

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-07-38.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:38</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=458" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Tiffany Barker:** Maybe they hit an artery." I didn't know. We didn't know anything. And we're trying to get information. And then I get one text come in and said, "<span id="ent-person-glenn-beck-t-00-07-38"><a href="/entities/person-glenn-beck.md">Glenn Beck</a></span> said he's stable." And I told the kids, "You guys, okay, he's okay." They're taking turns praying for him. So I connected with her after she made this video, and I wanted to specifically confirm and clarify two things. ^t-00-07-38

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-07-53.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:53</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=473" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Again, not because I think her or her nieces had anything to do with the assassination, but because they were eyewitnesses. And I first and foremost wanted to know why <span id="ent-work-good-morning-america-t-00-07-53"><a href="/entities/work-good-morning-america.md">Good Morning America</a></span> reached out to them. It didn't seem to me that any of the videos she put out would have inspired a producer to reach out and say, "Can you be our eyewitness, provide eyewitness testimony to what took place?" And she intimated to me that actually it was a political connection. That was the reason it happened. <span id="claim-claim-c838666a3eb7-t-00-07-53">Her sister ran as lieutenant governor alongside <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-07-53"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span>, and actually <a href="/entities/work-good-morning-america.md">Good Morning America</a> reached out to <a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a>, and somehow that is how—instead of her, <a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a> or her sister—they ended up with her sister's children and her, because they were at the event<a href="/claims/claim-c838666a3eb7.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. ^t-00-07-53

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-08-32.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:32</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=512" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, regarding her, obviously you heard her explanation for why they mentioned the artery. I wanted to see if they even recorded that footage of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-32"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> or if they were close enough to see that. And my answer to that would be no on the basis of the footage that she gave me. She has not yet provided any footage that would suggest that her nieces saw that graphic or were able—anything that was that descriptive. I think this might've been just a little bit of, like, political insertion, so to speak. Either way, I will say that kids being anywhere where a shot is ringing out is going to be traumatizing to a child. ^t-00-08-32

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-09-16.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:16</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=556" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And, of course, she is being honest that through discussion, she is the one that kind of gave them the idea regarding the artery. But then I decided to take a look—or just including this—I was simultaneously taking a look at <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-09-16"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span>, obviously. I wanted to track down <a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a>, because where was decoy boy sitting? Where exactly was he arrested? And I was able to discover something that I found to be quite odd. <span id="claim-claim-44a7e006b193-t-00-09-16"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a> was arrested in the same area, almost in the exact spot where <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-16"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s SUV departs, which to me—if you think somebody is the killer—you probably wouldn't send them in the direction of someone that they just shot<a href="/claims/claim-44a7e006b193.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. ^t-00-09-16

So first I want you guys—in case you don't understand the layout of this particular—if we're calling it a stadium that he was sitting—amphitheater that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-52"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was sitting—there is a tent, okay? And we're coming inward here. You can see that kind of half hexagon that's sitting there. Where that dot is, is where <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> is sitting. And you can see there's like a bridge walkway. And <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> has to walk underneath that to get to where his cars are, okay? So in front of him is the audience in that half hexagon. ^t-00-09-52

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-10-32.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:32</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=632" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And yep, we're coming inward right there, where you can see the mouse pointing—right there is where the SUVs were waiting, the SUV that carried <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-32"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. So they just went backwards from where the tent was, okay? And that underpass is right here. You can see a clear image of it, and you can actually see now we're in that underpass and are sitting—we are kind of where that SUV was. And you can see the back of the tent that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was in. <span id="claim-claim-aae4a54ab155-t-00-10-32">We were able to determine that it was approximately 40 seconds from the time that the shot rang off to when the security brings <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> into the waiting SUV<a href="/claims/claim-aae4a54ab155.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>.

So <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-11-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> departs, and about a minute and eight seconds later, we've got <a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a>, and he is in handcuffs. And I'm being—when I say a minute and eight seconds, I'm building in extra seconds. I'm trying to be as precise as possible. I am counting, and I'm watching everything. But I found it, again, odd that <a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a> is arrested in the exact same area that they just took <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, and it's fast, right? ^t-00-11-10

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-11-52.md" class="timestamp-link">00:11:52</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=712" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And it's especially fast because we then found footage of <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-11-52"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span> after the shot rings out, and we're gonna watch this. He's gonna get up, and people are dispersing everywhere, and he kind of calmly gets up and starts making his way down that stadium. You can see that here. We have the light on him. And his pants fall down by themselves. You can see that his pants did not—like, we were kind of working under the assumption that his pants fell down because, I don't know, the police were pulling him— but that's actually incorrect. They just fall down all by themselves. And you can see that a young man comes by to try to assist him. Okay, so it has nothing to do with the arrest. ^t-00-11-52

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-12-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=757" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, to be clear, when we see him sort of making his way down those stairs, we can actually approximate—because we did—like I said, we're counting seconds—that this happens, earliest, 30 seconds after the shot is fired. And that clip that you just watched is about 20 seconds long. It's about a full 50 seconds, and we know that <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-12-37"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span> is still sitting—is still standing right there, okay? So somehow <a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a> needs to get from where you just saw him, where his pants fall, to handcuffs in the SUV zone in about 40 seconds flat. Again, that's very fast. ^t-00-12-37

He just walks down. Like, you see him. He just is walking down the stairs, and he has his hat in his hand, and he starts waving, and he's going toward the left side of the tent. If you're behind the tent looking forward—like if you have <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-13-17"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s view—he is then going to kind of go down and he walks to the left side of the tent. So I wanted to show you this, like, second timeline that I put together, because this just lets you know what happened in the immediate aftermath. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>—I mean, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, I'm not sure if I told you to pull that. ^t-00-13-17

Forty seconds later, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s brought to the SUV. Ten seconds after that is where <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-13-58"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span>'s pants fall down in the middle of the departing crowd.

Not the vibe that I got, obviously, when you are behind your cell phone and you're getting all of these updates and you're trying to follow all the X accounts to see who has the newest information. I certainly was not under the impression that it all took—that all took place in just two minutes. So then that photo starts circulating online. You know which photo I'm talking about. It's <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-14-37"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span>, and he's bent down, and he is in handcuffs, and that goes viral. <span id="claim-claim-05af9066e08c-t-00-14-37">And so I wanted to get to the bottom of that—who actually shared that photo of <a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a> in handcuffs<a href="/claims/claim-05af9066e08c.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>.

And there's another thing that happens in the immediate aftermath that stands out to me. There is what I assume must be a donor, a sponsor of some description, or an employee of a donor/sponsor. And he tries to get close to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-15-22"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> after the shots are fired, but not in, like, a rescue way.

I don't know if it's just, like, obviously you're shocked. Maybe you're trying to be helpful—who knows? The security guard just kind of shoos him away immediately. And then what the guy does is he sort of just stands up, and he takes out—like, walks to the side and takes out a cell phone. So I'm going to show you that. That's—he's right there in the blue shirt. And, like, he —I don't—sends a text. As I'm watching the footage, it goes on a little bit longer. Like, sends a text, takes a photo—not entirely clear what's being done there—but it just sort of stood out to me, like, in the middle of the <span id="ent-work-chaos-t-00-16-01"><a href="/entities/work-chaos.md">chaos</a></span>, seeing that. And I would really like to know who that is, because we had received a ton of messages from current employees at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-16-01"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> that had mentioned that company. ^t-00-16-01

And according to the sources at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-16-38"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span>, it was a... rather young company—meaning that the company hasn't been around for very long—that came out in a really big way in terms of sponsorship for this tour. <span id="claim-claim-fbee0457cd85-t-00-16-38">And that's common sense, given the fact that WireFi—you will notice in the clips of the event—is the backdrop advertiser that's behind <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-16-38"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span><a href="/claims/claim-fbee0457cd85.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>.

And I'm interested in knowing who that is. So if you've got any answers for that, please let me know, because I would like to see what he took a picture of and to get his perspective on things. Certainly would like to identify who that individual is. I then decided to try to track down the origin of a video that actually no press has been done on.

And what I mean by that is it was very simple for me to find the account that published the video and made the video viral. And when I reached out to that individual, they were immediately responsive. And I said, hey, where did you get this footage from? And the individual said to me, a friend of a friend's family member sent it. So I'm like, okay, you're telling me the chain is already twice removed. ^t-00-18-24

And he said, no, I don't know who took the video. And when I asked the person who sent it to me to tell me who did—because I have all of these journalists, including yourself, reaching out to me, trying to get to the bottom of it—he just stopped answering me. I said, so your friend who sent you this video just stops answering you, and he then sends me a screenshot of a conversation that they're having on an app that I don't recognize, right? So we are prodding that, and he has been responsive, so I'm sure he'll tell me what app this is. And sure enough, the person says, well, there were two people actually who took that footage—which obviously is impossible—but there are two people that were involved in taking that footage, and he sends him two numbers. And those two numbers were both <span id="ent-gpe-chicago-t-00-19-08"><a href="/entities/gpe-chicago.md">Chicago</a></span>-based. ^t-00-19-08

Like, why are these two <span id="ent-gpe-chicago-t-00-19-52"><a href="/entities/gpe-chicago.md">Chicago</a></span>-based numbers? It was very weird and very sketchy. So then I have a guy who's on the ground in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-19-52"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>, and I asked him—a student—to start looking around, fishing around, and seeing if he could figure out who took that photo. Again, operating under the assumption that this must have been a student that was walking by the Pelosi Center. And he comes back and he says, I have a number of an individual. This is allegedly the person who took the footage. ^t-00-19-52

Is this a <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-20-36"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> student? He said, no. And I said, well, where did you get this number from? And he says, well, on the day there was a guy named Aaron who was walking around and was checking on people. And Aaron is the one that gave me this number. You know, I don't know Aaron even, but, like, he's the person that gave it to me. So then I said, can I have Aaron's number? He gives me Aaron's number, and Aaron also has a <span id="ent-gpe-chicago-t-00-20-36"><a href="/entities/gpe-chicago.md">Chicago</a></span> number. So I'm getting from somebody on the ground, and I'm getting from this person on <span id="ent-org-twitter-t-00-20-36"><a href="/entities/org-twitter.md">Twitter</a></span>, that all of these <a href="/entities/gpe-chicago.md">Chicago</a> numbers are involved, and that's not making sense to me.

I hop on the phone with him. He explains that it wasn't just him. It was one other person who he was walking with, who saw this person run across. Neither of them are students of <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-21-19"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span>. One of them said he was a student at BYU, which is Brigham Young University.

So I am confused, and we ask if he'd be willing to send us the footage and to get us on the phone with the person who actually took the footage. I had a conversation with that individual after all this running around—hence the reason these episodes take so long to put together, because you're calling people, you're waiting for responses, and... ^t-00-21-19

I said, was he wearing jeans? He said, no. Actually, this person was dressed in tactical gear, and he was wearing a face mask. And he said, according to him—like I said, he has a lot of experience with guns—that this person looked to him like a foreign agent.

And I'm going to read you directly a text message that he sent me—again, protecting his identity. He said, "Watching the video of the impact, hearing the sharp crack instead of a big hunting rifle's boom, and seeing what looked like a shorter rifle platform—albeit with the absence of the shape of a standard 30-round magazine— the assassin may have used a 10- or 20-round magazine, only expecting to shoot once or twice. ^t-00-24-44

Of course, I don't have access to any autopsy reports like you might, but if they found small shards of copper rather than one large copper-coated lead slug, that's the gun and bullet I would expect was used."

You might be curious as to what he had to say. First, I want to throw to some of our sponsors. <span id="ent-org-preborn-t-00-27-06"><a href="/entities/org-preborn.md">Preborn</a></span>—I've watched too many people who I am close to be vilified for standing up for truth. I've felt the sting of injustice, but I've also felt something else, which is courage. I think most of us are done playing defense. ^t-00-27-06

And right now, the greatest silence surrounds lives that are being ended before they even take their first breath. If we are going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like that. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For $28, that is what it costs to give an ultrasound—a free ultrasound—to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion. Just $28 will help her see the life that is growing inside of her and give her truth that the culture won't. So you shouldn't sit this one out. You shouldn't wait for permission. You can be just as bold and as clear and as unapologetically pro-life by heading to <span id="ent-org-preborn-t-00-27-49"><a href="/entities/org-preborn.md">preborn</a></span>.org/Candace right now.

Also want to tell you guys about Cozy Earth, because you work hard, you fight for your family, your values, and your future.

He's also the PR agent for <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-30-03"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. And he's also the one that issued the statement; therefore, about what is now being termed the other magic bullet—and magic bullet being the first one, JFK. It kind of seems like when the government might be involved, you know, bullets tend to have magical properties. Anyways, I've said yesterday his job is pretty tough, and it's made even tougher by the fact that he—if he's told to say something—he has to say it. That's just how it works in PR. And I'm sure there are lawyers involved as well. He went onto the <span id="ent-person-alex-clark-t-00-30-03"><a href="/entities/person-alex-clark.md">Alex Clark</a></span> podcast. Now it was kind of billed—I think people were expecting—but actually <a href="/entities/person-alex-clark.md">Alex Clark</a> never did say that—that <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-30-03"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> was going to be the one to answer questions pertaining to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-30-03"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and to clear up some rumors about his personal life. ^t-00-30-03

Again, I have no idea who said he was converting to Catholicism. I feel like it's intentionally misrepresenting what was said. Also, she was going to answer: did he take $150 million from <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-30-45"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>? Again, not something that we said on this show. And again, like I told you, they're going to address the SD cards. Now, I was very clear, and I am still kind of shocked by the reaction from the evangelical community. It was totally—just, it didn't make any sense to me—A, because <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-30-45"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>'s a cradle Catholic. ^t-00-30-45

I said <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was praying the Rosary, because he was. And I said that as a Catholic, of course, I was egging him to take the next step. Who wouldn't? Of course, you want—if you whatever your faith is—if you're evangelical and someone's thinking about converting, you're going to want to egg them on. That totally makes sense. And it wasn't said in an evil capacity. I said the joke that I said to <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>: "Take the next step. You're too smart to be a Protestant." That's a descriptor of our relationship. We were like brother and sister. It's said in humor and in jest. Hey, guys, I was Protestant like five minutes ago. ^t-00-31-25

It's like, no, he never took the first step in converting. But I think going to the Mass and praying the Rosary—obviously, it's going to get Catholics excited.

He loved the beauty of old Catholic churches and the stained glass. And him and Erika (Erika Kirk) would go sometimes. Well, Erika (Erika Kirk) is a cradle Catholic, but she ended up kind of like me. I grew up Catholic, and First Communion and went to Catholic high school, but then I ended up becoming a Christian in college through a Protestant church—through a non-denominational kind of more... Catholics are Christian. It was actually Presbyterian, and then it was kind of non-denominational. And I think Erika (Erika Kirk) kind of follows that same path. She and I share that. Also, by the way, I just want to draw attention to—she's posted a photo of her and <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-32-41"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and the kids in Mass before, and somebody in the comment section said, "Oh, are you guys converting?" and she said, "No, we just like attending sometimes."

I don't—there's no problem. He didn't have a problem with the act of that. He just didn't prefer it. And he loved, again, the ritual, the ancient you know, feel of a Catholic Mass and the fact that everybody around the world that was worshiping as a Catholic—he loved that. So he had some really big theological hangups with that. ^t-00-33-23

And yeah, he was attending Mass. And so usually if you are ritualistically attending Mass—meaning he liked the ritual—I'm not sure what that means. I don't understand what we're doing. It just feels weird. And to say he converted to Christian—Catholics are Christian. So he said—I think Andrew (Andrew Kolvet) said—I converted to Christianity. I went from being a cradle Catholic. And yeah, there is no question that Erika (Erika Kirk) and <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-34-13"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> were attending the Mass, and that's what I said, and I said that he was praying the Rosary.

I think it was a little deeper than that. And I agree that he did have some hangups, but that's kind of—when you make that thing of, like, he didn't really like having church in a gym—that's a step, right? So for me, that was a step where I was going, okay, like, I want something that feels a little bit deeper. It's a journey. Nobody was trying to start a Catholic versus Protestant war. I just shared something about, you know, my final conversations with him. And a lot of the conversations were about faith towards the end. ^t-00-34-57

He was extremely principled, especially on foreign money.

We want no aluminum in the vaccine. The MMR, I think, should be taken separately. This is based on what I feel—the mumps, measles. And the three should be taken separately. It seems to be that when you mix them, there could be a problem. So there's no downside in taking them separately. In fact, they think it's better. So let it be separate. The chicken pox is already separate, because when that got mixed in—I guess they made it for a while— it really was bad. So they make chicken pox individually there. ^t-00-47-35

So let those be taken separately. And then hepatitis B is sexually transmitted. There's no reason to give a baby that's almost just born hepatitis B.

Both the bodies and the minds of your children are what they want. That is the one resource that they wish to own. It is our offspring. They poison our minds.

And that is why I am obsessed with Sauna Space. You've seen those red light panels that are trendy, but this is totally different. It's the Glow Infrared Therapy Light from Sauna Space. It helps with screen fatigue, and it's amazing for your skin. In the morning, it's like natural sunlight—warm, comforting—and it resets your body clock. And at night, it helps you relax and get ready for a seriously deep sleep. You can even use it as a pain relief on the sore muscles or cramps if you have them. And the real game changer is their Fire Light Sauna. It's portable and it's powerful. ^t-00-51-08

In the Fire Light Sauna, you will sweat hard: it's deep detox, it's faster healing, better sleep, glowing skin, serious relaxation. It even boosts your immune system. So if you are a busy mom like me who's ready to take 20 minutes a day back for yourself, check out Sauna Space. Head to SaunaSpace.com/Candace and use code Candace, and you'll get a special 10% discount. Again, that's SaunaSpace.com/Candace—use code Candace at checkout.

Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends in American Financing, but maybe hesitated because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. Well, there is good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate—which means one predictable monthly payment—giving you the peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There are no upfront or hidden fees. ^t-00-52-34

It just makes no sense. His public views on the genocide and Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu), however, are the things that changed before his assassination. Yeah, I never accepted the Fed slop. That's what I call it—just Fed slop. ^t-00-53-14

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-53-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:53:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3235" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The whole message is, like I said, MAGA—my dad's extra MAGA. That's supposed to make people that are on the left go, oh my gosh, see? It's because of MAGA dad. It's, like, so ridiculous. And then on the right, you're supposed to go, trans. It's a trans person. We've talked about this and da-da-da-da-da. I just knew spiritually—as soon as I found out that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-53-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> got hit—that this was bigger than that. I just knew, and I maintain that, and I think now everyone who maybe were going to accept the Fed slop now appreciates that everything they're telling us makes entirely no sense. And they're lying—like, they are lying about a lot. And there's only one reason to lie. It's because you have something to hide. ^t-00-53-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-54-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:54:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3279" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I say just be transparent. I don't trust people that don't just release and speak about everything if they're being deemed suspicious. Like, transparency and honesty— it makes everything easier. That's why, like I said, I have no qualms about anything that I've said on the show, because I don't lie. There's no benefit. What do you get? What's the upside of lying about something? And so, yeah, I think they are finding out, and we have remained very committed to getting to the bottom of this. Jenna V. writes, "Thank you for fighting so hard for that precious human being, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-54-39"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>." He was amazing. I mean, I could say it a thousand times. There truly would not be me without <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. And I know that I held his head up during tough times, you know—when you are climbing and fighting through politics, that early phase. You're unknown. You go through a lot of really tough times and you're tired. ^t-00-54-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-55-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:55:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3320" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And similarly, he held my head up during a lot of tough times. And like I said, reading the messages of me—yeah, while we were sick, tired—we just always made it work. And he built that company. <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-55-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> built that company. And I... I don't know why, but it just sickens me to hear any lies or misrepresentations. It just makes me so angry. But I know that that's something that I have to deal with—my choice emotion. I guess that's my vice—is I always have to pull myself back consciously from wanting vengeance. And I don't want vengeance right now. I just want Christ. Christ is King because Christ is truth. And I want the truth about what happened. ^t-00-55-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-56-04.md" class="timestamp-link">00:56:04</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3364" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And we're not getting it at that moment. Miriam writes, "British Muslim here. Love the work you're doing, and I so stand by the point that this is good versus evil—slaves versus the elites. Yes, you are amazing, and I keep you and your family in my prayers." Thank you for praying for us. Truly, the prayers work. They are working, and I needed them a lot last week. I feel... better this week, which is one thing. I feel more focused in this—in many ways. And like I said, it arrived to me—something I really needed to hear—when Erika (Erika Kirk) said that it was quick. That was eating me up inside—like not knowing that answer. Previously, Temp writes, "They didn't kill <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-56-04"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>—only his physical form. Of course, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> lives on with the Lord our God in heaven forever and evermore." ^t-00-56-04

That's what I haven't accepted yet—is that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-56-46"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> is actually gone from this earth. Like, that just makes me really sad. It just makes me really sad. And sometimes the sadness—like I said—just turns into anger. And I know that that will kind of—it will change with time. I know that you're never—a year on, however you feel a year on, it will be better. And so I hold onto that. Carl writes, "My wife and I love your show. Gang gang. Thanks for always asking questions. You've opened a lot of people's eyes up to the obvious lying that is going on around us." ^t-00-56-46

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-57-29.md" class="timestamp-link">00:57:29</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3449" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That is the point of this. I did an interview earlier with a journalist, and she kind of said, what do you think, you know—podcasting getting big—what does it signify? It signifies that we don't believe the establishment anymore. And the establishment seems to be growing more radical, and they want to control speech as if that's going to make us believe them more. It's a nonsense—a terrible idea. Mary Kelly writes, "I love you, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-57-29"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. You are my Joan of Arc. Prayers for you and your family. Flame of Love Rosaries." Thank you so much for that. Chris writes, "Do we know who paid for the crime scene demolition? The pavers that were so quickly put down. Normally universities don't have expendable cash. Our rosaries are with you in prayer and Mass." Thank you so much. John 12:23—he ends that with, "We love you." ^t-00-57-29

Maybe it's Michelle and Chris. I don't know if that's another path that we could pursue. I feel like I thought it was the feds who did that? I could be incorrect. A feeling is not a fact. So I will explore that. That's a good question. <span id="claim-claim-87a18b7c8cad-t-00-58-12">MC writes, "There is a call on the police scanner after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-58-12"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> got shot, saying they were looking for someone wearing jeans, a black shirt, a black mask, and a black vest, carrying a long rifle." I heard that<a href="/claims/claim-87a18b7c8cad.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. I need to go over that scanner. And then they took that scanner—when they realized that 3,000 people had suddenly tuned in—they decided to privatize everything. But that is true, which is why we naturally have to ask the question: why did the public never hear that description if you only had one eyewitness testimony as to what that person was wearing? And we know that you have clear footage. ^t-00-58-12

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-58-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:58:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3525" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Obviously you have tons of clear footage. Why didn't you release it? Was it because we were gonna see somebody in tactical gear that looked foreign, or we were going to be able to identify the person further and realize that it wasn't <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-58-45"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>? I maintain that <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> is one piece of this, and a lot more people are involved. And I don't have to maintain that anymore by myself, because <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-58-45"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash Patel</a></span> has signified that that is so—in his long message that we spoke about yesterday, his long tweet that we spoke about—where he sort of cops to the fact that nothing they're saying at all makes any sense. Milana writes, "Hi, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-58-45"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, I wait for your live every day and dread the weekends. What curriculum do you recommend if I were to homeschool my kids?" ^t-00-58-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-00-59-28.md" class="timestamp-link">00:59:28</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3568" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** OK, so we are first doing a trial curriculum for the first time next week. So I will let you know. We're kind of editing it and making it our own—using a classical mixed in with Montessori approach because of the age of my children, and obviously working in our faith—starting with a morning prayer and trying to say, okay, what can we teach them? Because I have found that my son really loves Mass—the portions of Mass where he knows what's going on. So I'm like, well, we need to do more of that. And obviously, we go to the Latin Mass, which makes it a bit trickier for him. ^t-00-59-28

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-01-00-12.md" class="timestamp-link">01:00:12</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3612" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But I'm like, well, why not? Can they learn a Latin prayer? So I wanted to get involved—because I'm still a young Catholic student in many ways—and teach them that, because it would be, you know, also an opportunity for me to learn as if I was a preschooler. We are still working on that, and I will definitively share all that information publicly, because I want to inspire moms to take their kids out of schools—all of them. I want you—if you're listening and you're on the fence and you're like, I know spiritually I shouldn't be sending them there—there is a communist underground in this school. What they want your kids to do is to do drugs. They want to get them addicted to pornography and screens, and the effort is to turn them into slaves. Take your kids out of all the schools. That would be my advice. ^t-01-00-12

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-01-00-56.md" class="timestamp-link">01:00:56</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3656" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Lastly, lover of light writes, "Thank you for all that you do. I know this is a serious time, but don't forget to share some of those funny personal stories like your daughter forgetting her makeup. Love you, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-01-00-56"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>." Yeah, she is—that one's got quite the imagination. My daughter—she—my favorite thing that kids do at this age is the filibuster. If you think congressmen are good, you got to try to get a toddler to sleep and try to leave their room and the things that they come up with. And recently, she told me that her hair hurts. And I said, sweetie, I don't think that's a thing. And then she just sort of went, "Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Okay, we'll move on from that anyways." Yeah, it is another thing that always gets you through really tough times—obviously—is you just be around children. They are such a light. ^t-01-00-56

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-UBkFkg4UNY8/t-01-01-39.md" class="timestamp-link">01:01:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBkFkg4UNY8&t=3699" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** They really are such a light in this world. And I want everyone to have kids, and I want them to have lots of them, because I know the government doesn't want us to have any. They want to make our tribes smaller because they want to rule over us. And anyways, we'll have more for you tomorrow. Thank you guys so much. We'll see you then. Thank you guys so much. We'll see you then. Thank you guys so much. We'll see you then. ^t-01-01-39
