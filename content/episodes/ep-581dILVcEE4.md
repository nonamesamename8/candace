**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys, happy Tuesday. Rob McCoy, America's pastor. Remember, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) told him. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) told me I was America's pastor. Well, it sure as heck seems that this American pastor travels to Israel a lot. You know, a lot of these American pastors do. And he went there the other day to, of course, honor Charlie (Charlie Kirk). We're going to talk about that. And I want to just say Zionists are confusing at best. They say Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was their bestest friend forever and ever. Yet for whatever reason, they are deeply upset by this investigation. They are deeply upset that we revealed the license plate numbers associated with the Egyptian frequent flyers. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=44" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-00-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Why do you think they're upset about that? I don't understand. Why would something like that upset them? It's almost like they know something that we don't. And we're going to figure out what that is. Welcome back to Candace. So a couple of housekeeping items to start. My sister is an accountant. She hit me up this morning, and she told me that actually the filing deadline, if you file for an extension—which we can assume Turning Point did—was November 15th for this year. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=86" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-01-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So their filing would have been due on Saturday, this last Saturday, for Turning Point USA. And it is possible that they did file it on Saturday and maybe it's being processed. It would have been late beginning yesterday when we covered it. So I just wanted to update you guys on that. And of course, we will keep refreshing the IRS website and see whether or not that filing came through, since the whole world wants to see it. Anyways, back to our Zionist friends. Israeli and American Zionists are deeply bothered about the Egyptian plane. They're not concerned in the way that you think they would be. You would think that they would be, "Oh my gosh, thank you, Candace (Candace Owens). We love Charlie (Charlie Kirk) so much." ^t-00-01-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=128" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:08</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-02-08.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "We're very concerned to learn that these Egyptian military planes were tracking Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Erica Kirk for years." "What can we do to help?" "Gosh, we're right next door to them." "We did a lot to Egypt." "We actually control a lot, and we surveil a lot in that state." "Let us help you." Rather, their concern is that we revealed the rental license plates. These are real tweets from some Zionists. We've got Eyal Yakobi, who writes, "This is what doxing looks like." "These are unparalleled levels of insanity." "This is truly dangerous." Oh, it's dangerous. So basically, what doxing is, if you're not familiar with that term, ^t-00-02-08

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=171" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-02-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** is it's when you put private information up about an individual that can become identifiable. So like if I published your private address and then somebody could go to your home and harm you, that's what they're accusing me of. Erin Wexler—now this is the girl that was at the now infamous Hamptons retreat— She wrote this: "Candace (Candace Owens) started her career by doxing teenagers." "Old habits die hard." That is just so weird. I just thought she, the Hamptons people, would be on this Egyptian thing, trying to help as best they could, but they're actually more concerned for these Egyptians who are renting a car, and therefore, since they don't even go here, like, why would this be identifying information? ^t-00-02-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=213" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-03-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Are you concerned for, like, Hertz rent-a-car? What are you concerned about here? We're not clear. Now, going back to what we've learned about this flight thus far, I want to remind you that we have confirmed that this was a full flight over to Utah. This Egyptian flight—and I'm referring to SU-BTT—landed in Utah six days before Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. So we are looking at anywhere between 12 to 14 quote-unquote Egyptians that were on this flight and deplaned on September 4th, okay? ^t-00-03-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=256" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-04-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** A high government source actually reached out and made me aware. And this is stunning, actually, that we missed this common sense. I should have figured this out all by myself. But there is such a thing as federal protocol. They told me this person in the State Department confirmed that a foreign military jet actually can't just land on American soil without the federal government paying attention. It actually requires a federal escort. Okay? Again, common sense. I don't know how we didn't think of this ourselves. Of course, if you're a military jet, you can't just fly into foreign land and hop off the jet and be like, "Okay, bye." "Just gonna do whatever I want." Of course, they're gonna go, "Am I high?" "Are we starting a war here?" ^t-00-04-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=300" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-05-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "What's going on?" So this person tells me that, of course, that cannot happen. The government is immediately aware that this military-equipped plane is coming in, and an escort is provided because they want to know where they are going, what they are doing. So the question now is —and maybe Kash Patel can help us answer this, just kidding, we know he won't—who were the federal agents that escorted these Egyptians off the plane? Okay, because they didn't just disappear into the ether. You guys knew they were coming in, and you watched them, and you knew what they were doing in Provo. ^t-00-05-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=338" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-05-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And by the way, while we're checking in on these unanswered questions, has Turning Point mustered the courage to answer my yes or no—circle yes or circle no—as to whether or not these Egyptian jets were known to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Because like I said yesterday, it is highly plausible, highly likely that they were. He had a photographic memory, and he loved planes. He loved learning about military planes. He would have recognized that that was circling around him a few times while he was on the road and circling around Erica (Erica Kirk). Ladies and gentlemen, I want to make it very clear. Yes, this is a conspiracy. It is a federal-level conspiracy. It is likely an international conspiracy. ^t-00-05-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=378" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-06-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Multiple countries seem to be involved. And I really hate to upset the Zionist crowd any further—because I know I'm like your fave—but we now have identified a fifth verified rental plate that we can now add to the Egyptian mix. So that's a total of five rental cars that were rented by Duncan Aviation that we can review. Also want to thank the many of you who emailed us yesterday and informed me that I apparently do not know the difference between the letter N and the number nine. I think I just was saying nine or N every time I was reading these plates, which means I'm probably not qualified to be homeschooling my toddlers. ^t-00-06-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=422" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-07-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Anyways, I was mixing that up. I'm not going to mix it up now. These are our five plates as follows: a white 2025 Toyota Camry. This had an Arizona license plate, and that number is CWN—like Nancy—9872, okay? Our second plate is a silver 2025 Toyota RAV4. That is a Utah license plate, and that number is T092ZS. Okay. ^t-00-07-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=461" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-07-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Third vehicle that we have here is a white 2023 Toyota RAV4, another Utah license plate. The number is T912KM. And we have a black 2025 Toyota 4Runner, Utah license plate. And that plate is Z923DA. And we can now present to you guys a fifth car, which we know was rented. ^t-00-07-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=500" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-08-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That is a gray or silver 2025 Toyota 4Runner, Utah license plate number Z349AA. Five vehicles which were secured by Duncan Aviation. Now, since I wasn't born yesterday, I feel pretty confident concluding that these 12 to 14 Egyptians didn't drop into Provo, Utah, in the six days leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination to fix like a broken light on the plane, okay? Again, my source there is me not being born yesterday. ^t-00-08-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=545" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-09-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's just not how it works. You cannot just get something very quickly fixed in a couple of days and be on your way. And like I said, they weren't even on the plane on the way out. They waited for that anchor plane, SU-BND, the other Egyptian military plane, to take them back home. So what are we looking at here? What exactly were these Egyptians with the federal escorts doing on the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination? Well, in terms of some potentially interesting leads, someone—many of you guys actually noted to us—that the cars that were in the driveway in the now infamous footage of the alleged shooter, right, which was somehow distributed by TMZ. We don't know how that happened. ^t-00-09-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=588" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-09-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Should probably be investigated further because that's a lot of cars in the driveway. And obviously every image that we have is blurred. Okay, it seems like we just can't get a clear image at all in this story. And so we cannot—it's impossible to discern anything— but it's therefore possible that some of those cars that we are looking at could be the rented vehicles, right? Maybe the one parked on the right there is the Toyota RAV4; maybe the two that look similar—one that's dark, one that's lighter—could that be the gray and the black 4Runner? I don't know, but that could be compelling. ^t-00-09-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=623" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-10-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That would be something that perhaps Joe Kent and Tulsi Gabbard—who are warring, or at least that's what the press said, warring with the FBI, or warring with Kash Patel—could look into. Because this is Egyptian, okay? This is Egyptian. And I also want to add here something that I have always suspected that makes perfect sense to me, which would be the reason that UVU has denied every request, not just to release footage of the day of the assassination, but also to release footage of the days leading up to the assassination. Why? I think it's because the footage that we have seen, right, was recorded before September 10th. ^t-00-10-23

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=667" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-11-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I always felt that in my gut. I always felt it was a distraction: the person in the staircase, walking across the street in two different outfits. I just felt that some of this footage was recorded in the days leading up, okay? And now, now that we know that those Egyptian planes came in six days before—six days before Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination—it's possible that they could have staged some of that, which they eventually edited maybe a bit and released it to TMZ in that timeframe. ^t-00-11-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=698" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-11-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** What we do know factually—and we don't have to surmise—is that there were eyewitness accounts. You may have lost—obviously a lot of stuff came out immediately—but what got lost in the fold was that there were eyewitness accounts of people having seen someone on that roof in the week before the shooting. This got buried in the press. There were students and allegedly a professor who reported seeing someone on the roof a week earlier. And I think we should try to track down these students. Of course, CNN, which ran this article—which I can show you here—didn't include their names, but here is the article. ^t-00-11-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=738" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-12-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You can see it was published the day after the assassination, and it reads, "Utah Valley University student recalls seeing man walking on or near the Lozier Center roof twice in two weeks." And from that article, it says the student says that he last saw the person on the roof last Wednesday at noon, a week before the shooting. He told CNN that he reported his observations to the FBI tip line after the shooting, but he has not heard back. The student described the man as tall, skinny-ish, white dude with dark hair. He had a backpack on and was wearing dark clothes. He added that the man was looking down at the courtyard area where Kirk's speaking engagement was later. Okay, now here's what I did. ^t-00-12-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=780" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-13-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I dug through all of our emails once I realized this and went, "Okay, maybe there's something here." We should probably look a little further into this. Let's leave no stone unturned. And I found actually that one of you guys had sent me a tip a while ago about this, and you had captured that recording. And I'm gonna let you listen to this person's testimony. This is, by the way, taken on September 11th. So this is a day after the shooting. We didn't have much details a day after the shooting, and this individual was a student that is being interviewed by another student about what he observed in the aftermath. So it's a—I think it's about a three-minute recording. Let's listen to this observation because it could be important. ^t-00-13-00

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=825" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-13-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** (Student Interview Clip) Do you think it was last Tuesday or last Wednesday? And recount the first time meeting him and recount the second time, maybe what you remember? Do you remember like what time of day it was? Yeah, I guess I don't remember the exact day. I know at least the second time was last week, either Tuesday or Wednesday. Yeah. So last Tuesday and Wednesday, but they were on separate days. They were separate days. It may have been both last week, Tuesday and Wednesday. One of them might have been like the week before Thursday or something. But yeah, like I said, it wasn't memorable or significant enough at the moment for me to really remember. ^t-00-13-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=869" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-14-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** What did he look like? Skinny, tallish white guy. Had like baseball cap on or some kind of hat, I think. Had a backpack. Dark hair, I think. Was he dressed in like dark clothing? Yeah, he was. Was it like black or something? Something dark. Is it similar to what was seen in the pictures? Yeah, for sure. And that's—that's kind of why I thought about when I saw the pictures. I guess I don't think I'd remember enough to really definitively say that the guy I saw is the guy in the pictures. ^t-00-14-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=912" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-15-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** I just know I saw a guy wandering around on the roof, and the guy that I saw in the pictures looks similar. But it was the same roof of the same building? Yes. Well, I don't know that exactly because it's the computer science building has this long concourse that connects to the Lozier Center. My bet would be that that's how the shooter got onto the Lozier Center roof because that's... one of the few ways I know of. I guess there's also a ladder on the other side. As in that's how he got on yesterday or last week? Oh, well, last time I saw it, and he came off of there. Okay, and you said he like jumped over the fence? ^t-00-15-12

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=951" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-15-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Yeah, there's kind of a railing around there's this like concourse sticking out from the CS building that people are actually supposed to be allowed to walk on. Okay. And he walked over that railing and started wandering around the ledge. Oh, OK. And facing which way? He was totally looking out in the direction of that fountain courtyard and out this way. The first time I thought it was a little weird, but didn't think much of it. Decided not to say anything, especially because another guy walked back. I think he was a professor. I don't—I've seen him around a lot more. And he comes from below, and he shouts up at the guy. He asks, "Are you OK?" The guy up there says, "Yeah, yeah, I'm doing fine." And the professor says, "OK," and walks away. ^t-00-15-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=996" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-16-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** And I kept walking, because I had work to do. And that was the first or second time? That was the first time. And then what about the second time? The second time I saw him do the same thing. He hopped the railing, started wandering around. Was he dressed in the same clothing? Similar. I don't remember enough to say whether it was the same. And it was the same guy? It was definitely the same guy those two times. ^t-00-16-36

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=1022" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-17-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, so we were able to figure out who the student was. I don't know why CNN declined to publish his name, but I was going to figure out who the student was, and I'm going to chase down this lead, and I want to open up that possibility because it is a possibility that the stairwell photo and the footage that we have seen of the shooter was actually recorded before the assassination. Of course, that's a possibility. In the absence of quite literally anything verifiable the feds have given us. Everything is therefore a possibility. So I want to also open this up because I don't want to just hear it from one student or CNN. I want to hear it from more students, right? That would be something that you would remember. We keep talking about what happened on 9-10. What about in the days leading up to 9-10? What about 9-6, right? 9-7, 9-8, 9-9. ^t-00-17-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=1062" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-17-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** If you are a student and you saw someone up on the rooftop in the days or in the week leading up to the assassination, we want to hear from you. More tips at candaceowens.com because every time I have tried to chase down the leads regarding the rooftop, I am brought to a military person, and I just don't know that any of that actually took place on the day. And I think that's why they won't release any more footage. There should be multiple angles, right? If this all happened on 9-10, there would have been multiple angles, and they sure as hell would have released it in the middle of a manhunt, when you thought that he could kill other people. You would have released more footage. And they're not doing that, which means they're hiding something. And something that they could be hiding could be nothing. ^t-00-17-42

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=1105" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-18-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It could be nothing that happened on that rooftop. Also, I want to add on here that regarding the white RAV4, we got a lot of emails from the public that have noted that there appears to be what might be a RAV4 in every available footage that we have been provided of the shooter. So we've only seen four pieces of footage of the alleged shooter. One, of course, of him walking in front of—I think this was the house that Phil Lyman was at. Yes, that's what we just discussed. That sure as heck could be a white RAV4. The second piece of footage being the... TMZ released footage of somebody else in the neighborhood of him walking. ^t-00-18-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=1150" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-19-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Yep, that sure as heck could also be a RAV4. Footage number three is that footage of the alleged shooter pulling out in the parking lot, which was provided by Ryan Matta that he chased down. Yep, that also could be a RAV4. And also, of course, the footage where he allegedly jumps off the rooftop. Many of you said it looked like there was a RAV4 pulling up. Look, yes, all of it's possible. Is it also possible that this is just a coincidence? Yes, it could be a coincidence. It also could be a conspiracy. We have to explore every lead because the feds are not—they are implicated in this cover-up. And this is how investigations work. You chase down theories; you posit theories; you chase down those theories, and you are open to being proven wrong. ^t-00-19-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=1195" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-19-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So that's what we have for you guys also. Going to have a major, major, major scoop tomorrow about what's happening on the inside of Turning Point USA. I just want to triple-, quadruple-confirm, but we need to focus our attention on each and every plane that arrived in the aftermath of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) being shot: the planes that took off and arrived. I brought up one plane to you. We were able to determine that that plane that departed Scottsdale at eight local time and landed at about 10 a.m. local time into Provo was owned by a Turning Point USA donor, T.W. Lewis. Actually, Turning Point USA is featured on T.W. ^t-00-19-55

I'd like to know who was on that plane. That's interesting to me. If you know who was on that plane and you are a Turning Point insider—or maybe you were working in Scottsdale on that day at a terminal—we're looking for a plane again that took off at about 8 a.m. I wonder who's on that plane. That is of interest to me because it wasn't Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and they got into Provo just ahead of the assassination, and it has to be somebody big. I don't think the students are flying around on private planes. It'd be great if that foundation, T.W. Lewis Foundation, could help us out. I don't think they will for some reason. We keep coming up against the wall from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s friends, but we want to hear from you. ^t-00-20-39

Okay, we're going to be right back because Turning Point is dropping receipts—kind of a little bit. We're going to talk about Blake Neff, who dropped a receipt; Brian Harpole, the security who dropped a receipt—right after a few of our sponsors. Many people have been vilified for standing up for truth, and many people have felt the sting of injustice for doing so. But a lot of people right now are also feeling courageous. Many of us are done playing defense. I'm certainly not watering down what I believe to be palatable because silence is not kindness. Of course, silence is consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds the topic of those whose lives are ended before they take their first breath. If we are going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like it always. ^t-00-21-22

Just $28—which is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion—you can help her see the life that is growing inside of her. $28 will help her to see the truth that the culture will not tell her. So do not sit this one out. Do not wait for permission. You can be bold, clear, and unapologetically pro-life by heading to preborn.org/Candace right now. You can give $28, or you can give 10 times that amount if you can. This is the line that we have to stand on. We have to stand up for truth and for justice.

If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than right now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is so expensive and your credit cards are already being pushed to the max. Well, with rates dropping, now is the perfect time to pay off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They're saving people that are like you an average of $800 a month. And many are seeing rates in below fives, which is a complete game-changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, which will give you extra breathing room for the holidays. And it costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. ^t-00-22-49

Well, Turning Point USA is finally dropping some receipts. Kind of—not really—but it's more than we've received thus far, which is nothing, so it's something.

Now, Brian Harpole is one of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s long-term security team members. On the day of the assassination, you'll recognize he's the guy that had the black strap. I don't know if we have a photo. He had a bag across him, and he was standing to the front right of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), kind of looking out at the audience. You're going to see him in a second. He is the one who then runs over to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And again, you recognize him because he kind of has that small supposed-to-be-a-medical bag over him.

"It has a couple of staircases that go up to walkways on the roofs." He comes back for edification: the Sorensen Center was the building in front of the Lozier Center.

You could have followed up because it's your job, and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) paid you millions of dollars not to pass the buck. No. Also, you asked the police chief an either-or question. And I'm just kind of like trying to understand the basic construct of sentences. He said, "Got you covered." What does that mean? It was an either-or question. Either provide us access or get somebody up there. "Got you covered" means what? No follow-up. That's it. Millions and millions of dollars on his security annually.

I'm not going, "Oh, this is UVU's fault," okay? By the way, Jeff Long also has a very extensive military career. I... obviously have been very clear that I believe that this was a military-level assassination.

On the basis of that answer, you should all be fired. On the basis of that answer. You didn't have it within you to go, "Let me follow up and make sure that's been secured," because that's my job. Let me walk the path and see. The fact that a student told you—and you didn't know that— Shouldn't you have told the student? You shouldn't have said to the student, "Hey, we're looking at a map" because it's amazing—it's 2025, and there's this thing called Google Maps.

Of course he should be fired. Elsewhere in the interview, he responds to the question of why they didn't at least have drone coverage on that day since they have flown drones—many drones—at TPUSA events in the past.

Yeah. Did you ask them anything? Absolutely. So we come in, and we start looking at things immediately like, where are our risks? It's a risk assessment when we come in. That's why we get there. That's why we start doing the advance so early. We walk it; we build it ourselves. And so initially, I spent thousands of dollars on drones last year and got the guy's license. But if the area lies in the Provo, Utah airspace, I can't fly it. That's a 107B. We can't break the rules, right? ^t-00-29-05

And then, and then so—but Orem PD has a drone unit, active and professional. And that police department, I will tell you right now, is awesome. They are; they get it. They were there; they helped both on the soft side and the hard side. And so I started asking questions: "You guys have a drone unit?" "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, good."

Both of us, I think at about the same time, realize that that means there is a shooter who is on the scene. And you just hear the crack. So you don't know: did it come from far away? Did it come from close? Is there a mass shooter unfolding right now? I and him both had the reaction of, "Let's get out of here before we are both shot." That is not us abandoning Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had a security team. They all leapt immediately into action, and they got Charlie (Charlie Kirk) out of there, which was what their job was to do.

So I was not with Mikey, or I don't remember being with him. I think I was ahead of him as we left, and we get out, and I run for —it must have been more than 15 or 20 seconds. And then I realized there hasn't been another shot, so the shooter has likely been detained or stopped or something—not in immediate danger. I pause; I look around me; and I see Mikey.

"I've got to go." And I remember that call. And around the time I put that phone away, and then he immediately calls his dad. He calls Rob McCoy.

Yeah, he's a general. We know he's amazing. We love him. He's just the most magnificent thing I've ever seen. It's stunning. It's brave. It's everything. It's every adjective I ever knew and more. What's interesting there is that Blake Neff then had a back-and-forth with somebody on X. And I want to be clear: I actually don't think Blake Neff is in on the corruption here. I don't know why; I've just never gotten that vibe. I think he believes what he's saying. Like I said, he is telling the truth as far as I can tell. Vibe check, right? But what's interesting is he allows us to now date—or rather put some time markers here—on how long the phone call was between Mikey and Erica, right? ^t-00-35-34

He's having a back-and-forth spat with somebody on X a few days ago—or we could go; I don't remember— and he decides to drop his call log with his mom, or rather a screenshot of the call that he had with his mom. Now remember, Blake is in Arizona now, so this is going to say 11:24. It's supposed to be obviously 12:24 Utah time. We can show you that. You can see he calls his mom, and the call is 45 seconds long, and the call begins at 11:24. So a story that he tells us is he's running for 20, 30 seconds—however long he said there—not long. He stops, catches his breath. He sees Mikey. Mikey's got a quivering lip. Mikey looks at him, and he says, "I've got to call Erica." And he says Mikey calls Erica, and then I call my mom. ^t-00-36-17

That's the next thing that happens. That's a very short phone call, right? That allows us to at least get a sense of how this ran because he's now confirming he called her first. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot at 12:23, right? So these are back-to-back phone calls. It actually—if it happened this quickly with this receipt— it's possible that Rob McCoy did think he was the first person that was called because Rob McCoy is getting called at 12:24 or 12:25. This is all happening within two minutes, right? These phone calls are flying within two minutes, right? That means when he terminates that call, it's—what?—12? ^t-00-37-01

When you're looking at his screenshot there, is that telling us when the call began or when the call terminated? It's when the call is initiated. When the call is initiated. So it's possible 45 seconds later he's now in the 12:25, and now Mikey's calling his dad. That's very interesting. That's just another data point that we at least have there. Moving on to the pastor—America's pastor—Rob McCoy. I just think in general, by the way, I want to give a shout-out to Calvary Chapel because I knew nothing about Calvary Chapel before this investigation.

And they're perverting this Judeo-Christian brotherhood and ethic by essentially promoting Jew hatred but putting a Christian label on it. What can we do to push back? And what can the church do to be able to just completely repudiate that kind of dishonesty and perversion of what Judeo-Christian values truly are? ^t-00-38-58

We've gotten into this situation with that generation of young people because they have all been raised by Caesar, and we're wondering why they become Romans. We have abdicated our public school system to secularism, and it's the red-green revolution: where you take away with secularism the moral foundation, and then you come in with—whether it be Islam or ethno-nationalism—because we've gone through critical race theory, diversity, equity, and inclusion. We've taken white males and put them at the bottom of the totem pole. ^t-00-39-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2422" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:40:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-40-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_5:** We've mocked them and embraced the stupidity, and now we're upset that they feel as though they've been relegated to obscurity, and now they're signing on with these awful directions in life. So it's interesting to think about them discussing how we need to be re-educated again—kind of like the Robert Maxwell campaign—like we had to have the Holocaust education. ^t-00-40-22

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2449" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:40:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-40-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I want you to imagine a world where Calvary Chapel churches get to decide how we're educated because somebody sent me an actual magazine that they have. Again, I'm new to the Calvary Chapel thing that's happening. I knew they were behind a lot of the attacks against me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) this year, but I hadn't realized how—like I said—naked in propaganda this is. This is this month's issue of Calvary Chapel magazine. Apparently they have their own magazine. And this is not parody. This is "Judeo Christianity." This is the cover of Calvary Chapel magazine from this month. And it says, "Stand with Israel." It tells the story of "surfer to shepherd." I guess that's somebody's story. And then you have there a subtitle. ^t-00-40-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2494" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:41:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-41-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I guess we're gonna be able to read this article in there. "Why Jews are hated." You go to your church on Sunday, and this is what they are handing out. Now, the person who sent me this then showed me what was inside, which is even more amazing. Here we go. Here we are learning about Christianity. Oh, actually, it's a photo of IDF soldiers wearing yarmulkes coming home. And it has a quotation here that said, "God began to paint a prophetic portrait of the Messiah." I just want to know how this happened, I guess. I don't know. I was asleep. I didn't know this was going on. I didn't understand that they have so many megachurches everywhere—everywhere across America. ^t-00-41-34

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2536" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:42:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-42-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And they basically exist to convince Christians to worship the IDF. I just find that to be quite strange. Let me know if I'm out of pocket here and you really think that this is not propagandist and that you're learning Christ's message when you line up and you get handed stuff like this. I don't know. I just feel like that for me is something that we need to talk about more because it's pretty obvious what happened here. And of course, Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) Netanyahu was involved in the Calvary Chapel churches. We're gonna get to that tomorrow: his relationship with Bob Coy—not to be confused with Pastor Rob McCoy—but Bob Coy, the one from Fort Lauderdale, who got into a little bit of a scandal with sexual abuse. Again, we'll get into that tomorrow. ^t-00-42-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2581" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:43:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-43-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Before we get into comments—when we get into comments rather—I'm gonna tell you—finally answer that question, that lingering question—when I told you I would find out what was the name of the donor that similarly freaked out and spazzed out when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) let Tucker (Tucker Carlson) speak on stage and took a million dollars away from Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I'm gonna tell you who that donor was just after a few more sponsors. All right, you guys, I think we all know now the biggest health secret that is not discussed often is that everything begins in the gut. Every day our guts are fighting a silent war against processed foods, work stress, toxins that are in the air that we breathe. Well, when our gut is in trouble, the whole body feels it. Most probiotics do not work. ^t-00-43-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2623" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:43:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-43-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** 99% of the traditional brands die in our stomach acid before they reach our guts. That's what makes Just Thrive's spore-based probiotic completely different. Just Thrive is the only probiotic that is clinically proven to arrive 100 percent alive in our guts. It does something that no other probiotic can. It turns our gut into an antioxidant factory, creating protective compounds exactly where we need them most. That means better digestion, healthy immunity, more energy, and easy weight management. You can take Just Thrive Probiotic in the form of a capsule or a berry-flavored gummy. From their award-winning probiotic to their full line of gut, immune, and brain health supplements, Just Thrive has been fighting to make Americans healthy again with science-backed solutions that we can trust. ^t-00-43-43

See the difference for yourself, or you will get a full product refund—no questions asked. Take control today with Just Thrive. Again, that's JustThriveHealth.com, and use promo code Candace. Also reminding you guys about Neemy Skincare because you've heard me speak a lot about Neemy. I love what their three-step anti-aging routine has done for my face, which is why I'm also excited to tell you guys that Neemy Skincare now has a complete body line as well: their foundational body bundle. It's a simple three-step routine. ^t-00-44-24

It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy. And just like their facial skincare, Neemy's body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients. And best of all, it's made right here in the USA by a company that's built on our values: faith, family, and of course, freedom. Finally, you can stop supporting radical corporations and give your money to a company that actually honors you. It's time to take care of all of your skin with products that you can trust. So head to neemyskincare.com. Use my code CANDACE10 at checkout, and you'll get 10% off your entire order. Again, that's neemyskincare.com. ^t-00-45-00

Tucker (Tucker Carlson) went max, and by max I mean just said like basic American principles—like we shouldn't be worshipping Israel, that the Epstein files should be released, and that obviously our relationship is not America-first with Israel—and that caused a donor meltdown. It was like a last straw. We have showed you the data points. We have showed you the timeline. That's where things start to get a little dicey with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And I think it's very relevant. Anyways, I had mentioned to you that there was—because everybody's miked up— I told you all this was miked up. ^t-00-45-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2790" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:46:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-46-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Obviously, Megyn and Kelly happened to have that footage, but they have that footage with like full clarity of exactly what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said to Tucker (Tucker Carlson). And they have the footage of the donors who freaked out—at least the audio of the donors who freaked out. I told you about a woman who yelled and took away a million dollars because of the Tucker (Tucker Carlson) speech. That woman was Joyce Chernick. Joyce Chernick is married to Aubrey Chernick. He's a software tech billionaire guy. They fund a variety of pro-Israel causes through the David Horowitz Freedom Center. So that was another donor who went, "Bye-bye, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." "How dare you let him speak and say thanks?" ^t-00-46-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2833" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:47:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-47-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Also reminding you guys: if you'd like to support us, "Make Him a Sandwich" is available. You can go to makehimasandwich.com. If you'd like to pick up a regular copy, we also have signed copies at candaceowens.com. We also have new merch on the website. Plus our Black Friday sale is active. You can use code BLACK20 for 20% off. That's store-wide. It does not include books, and that runs through to Cyber Monday. So do not miss out. And reminding you guys that book club this week is going to be on Thursday. I don't know if I even told you guys that. I think we sent out an email, but telling you this for the first time on the show that we bumped it to six o'clock Eastern on Thursday. So no book club tonight. We'll have it at 6 PM Eastern on Thursday. ^t-00-47-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2876" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:47:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-47-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Top comment from yesterday's episode is from Abby Sloan. She writes, "I don't think they realize that if Candace (Candace Owens) had an audience of one, she would still be doing this investigation." Amen. Yes, I would still be doing this investigation. And sometimes these investigations do have to be done with an audience of one. Definitely a lot of times in the past before people were more dialed in to the fact that there is something tremendously evil going on in this country. And our feds are not interested in discovering that evil because they are a part of the evil. I think we all accept that. Not just in this country—worldwide, right? There's something about the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination that we spiritually already recognize has international implications. That's very clear. ^t-00-47-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2917" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:48:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-48-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And it will become more clear in the coming weeks as I continue to roll out information. We don't do everything very quickly because this is a game of cat and mouse, and we need to know where the snakes are. We need to know where the rats are on the ship, and there are a lot of them. And we are getting closer. I think I can confirm to you guys that there is mass panic over the show. I guess they thought they were gonna get away with it. They were hoping that they had successfully fostered this ADHD culture where people are just unable to pay attention to anything, right? Not even like a Netflix show can they pay attention to long-term. So they were hoping, "Okay, we're going to do this thing at the Staples Center, and then move on from it." And actually, it turns out the world is focused, and they're locked in. ^t-00-48-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=2961" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:49:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-49-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And the feds are not going to get away with it. That is what I can say. They are not going to get away with it this time. Okay, getting into your comments today. Jennifer writes, "It's official." "I'm a conspiracy theorist." "Ask questions. Seek the truth." "Thank you, Candace (Candace Owens)." "We don't know, no, but we know." "Why follow Erica, who was on the planes? We're being lied to, and I don't like it." "I am glad that CK has you to ask the right questions and get some answers." Yeah, I saw you guys—a lot of you guys in the chat—asking why these particular planes were following Erica (Erica Kirk). I have an indication as to why. Of course, I want to thoroughly vet that and to make sure that I ask the right people to confirm the things that we are looking at. But I have an indication as to why that may have been. ^t-00-49-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=3003" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:50:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-50-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Just Common Sensing It writes, "Rep. Massie, Green—any Republican or Democrat representative that is watching—please put forth a bill to end foreign and domestic lobbying." "It's the only way we have a shot at a government that does not put foreign and big corporation interests before ours." Yes, you are correct. Don't forget that when JFK tried to put an end to that—well, I guess rather put an end to the Israel exception that we now have by making them sign up and acknowledge FARA, to follow the FARA—they shot him. Who is they? Who is they? I don't know, but it ended up being reversed. So we should not accept that. ^t-00-50-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=3042" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:50:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-50-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We should not accept lobbying full stop, but we certainly shouldn't accept this sort of Israel exception, which is they do not have to certify anything under FARA. Obsessed Sports Rights. "If the planes are truly from the Egyptian government, would that mean their passengers in cargo would have diplomatic immunity and allow them to do illicit activities—espionage, weapons trafficking, et cetera—without much oversight?" You are on the right track. Certainly there are a lot of implications with why this plane would be allowed in and the federal government would escort it and then everyone would play dumb when Candace (Candace Owens) mentioned this flight being on the ground. It's interesting. Definitely more questions than answers, but we will have answers for you guys. ^t-00-50-42

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=3087" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:51:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-51-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Kayla Ferris writes, "Several people said there was a lot of vehicles at the home of the alleged shooter around the week before the shooting, right?" That's another tip. You are correct, and I should explore that. They all said it was strange because they never had company over. You are absolutely correct, and I can try to hunt that down and see what I come up with for you guys tomorrow. Renee writes, "Talk to the neighbors." "They were complaining about many cars parked. That residents' possibly ring cameras will show the footage of those vehicles." I would imagine Kash has taken everything. They were making sure they had secured everything under the guise of trying to discover who murdered Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Obviously they were cleaning things up, but we can try. If you guys have footage, that would be great. ^t-00-51-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=3131" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:52:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-52-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Again, we want to see the days leading up. So relevant timeframe would be from 9-4 up until 9-10, looking for these vehicles—these five vehicles that we have now shown you. L. Hodges writes, "I find it insane how influencers Tim Pool were speaking up against you regarding Turning Point USA and you no longer being invited to AmFest." Apparently he said something hurtful, and they said he can't go. Weird. I am not following what Tim Pool has been saying. I know that he was kind of—he always kind of throws shade about me investigating things. I did see a clip on X that when we started this investigation of him saying people were doing it for clicks—which is just—I have no response to that. ^t-00-52-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=3172" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:52:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-52-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's just—I can't think of more things that were done for clicks and for money than selling t-shirts of what he died in, making 70 million dollars. I have not sold anything with Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s face or Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s name. I have kept up my job, which was always investigating—as I've been doing this entire year, the last two years— authentically. Magnetic writes, "Wild how Candace (Candace Owens) stays 10 steps ahead while everyone else is still reacting to yesterday's news." And I can't win with these people. They say I have no proof, and I present proof, and they accuse me of doxing. They say I have no proof, and then I drop the text messages, and they're like, "How dare you share the private text messages." They're just lying. They are lying, and I am telling the truth. That's it. That's what's happening right now. ^t-00-52-52

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=3216" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:53:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-53-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Twins vs Twins writes, "Can we get a book that is not signed?" Yes. MakeHimASandwich.com has the unsigned books. MakeHimASandwich.com has the unsigned books. Hope that helps you out. And you guys, thank you. Again, we're working on a very, very big lead tomorrow that I believe that we should be able to present tomorrow as we begin to sort through all of the planes that were flying on that day. Who was on each plane is now very relevant. As we take a look at this picture of why this SU-BND jet might have been transponding without moving at Duncan Aviation. ^t-00-53-36
