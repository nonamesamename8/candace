Remember, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> told him. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> told me I was <a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a>'s pastor. Well, it sure as heck seems that this American pastor travels to <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> a lot. You know, a lot of these American pastors do. And he went there the other day to, of course, honor <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. We're going to talk about that. And I want to just say <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> are confusing at best. They say <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was their bestest friend forever and ever. Yet for whatever reason, they are deeply upset by this investigation. They are deeply upset that we revealed the license plate numbers associated with the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> frequent flyers.<span id="event-event-2025-09-04-egyptian-military-plane-su-btt-lands-in-provo-utah-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-04-egyptian-military-plane-su-btt-lands-in-provo-utah.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-00-00

I don't understand. Why would something like that upset them? It's almost like they know something that we don't. And we're going to figure out what that is. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. So a couple of housekeeping items to start. My sister is an accountant. She hit me up this morning, and she told me that actually the filing deadline, if you file for an extension—which we can assume <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> did—was November 15th<span id="event-event-2024-11-15-turning-point-usa-irs-filing-deadline-wi-t-00-00-44"><a href="/events/event-2024-11-15-turning-point-usa-irs-filing-deadline-wi.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> for this year.<span id="event-event-2025-11-15-turning-point-usa-tax-filing-deadline-passes-witho-t-00-00-44"><a href="/events/event-2025-11-15-turning-point-usa-tax-filing-deadline-passes-witho.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-00-44

And it is possible that they did file it on Saturday and maybe it's being processed. It would have been late beginning yesterday when we covered it. So I just wanted to update you guys on that. And of course, we will keep refreshing the IRS website and see whether or not that filing came through, since the whole world wants to see it. Anyways, back to our <a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a> friends. <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israeli</a></span> and American <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> are deeply bothered about the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> plane. They're not concerned in the way that you think they would be. You would think that they would be, "Oh my gosh, thank you, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. We love <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> so much." ^t-00-01-26

"What can we do to help?" "Gosh, we're right next door to them." "We did a lot to <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-02-08"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egypt</a></span>." "We actually control a lot, and we surveil a lot in that state." "Let us help you." Rather, their concern is that we revealed the rental license plates. These are real tweets from some <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-02-08"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span>. We've got <span id="ent-person-eyal-yakobi-t-00-02-08"><a href="/entities/person-eyal-yakobi.md">Eyal Yakobi</a></span>, who writes, "This is what doxing looks like." "These are unparalleled levels of insanity." "This is truly dangerous." Oh, it's dangerous. So basically, what doxing is, if you're not familiar with that term, ^t-00-02-08

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-02-51.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:51</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=171" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** is it's when you put private information up about an individual that can become identifiable. So like if I published your private address and then somebody could go to your home and harm you, that's what they're accusing me of. <span id="ent-person-erin-wexler-t-00-02-51"><a href="/entities/person-erin-wexler.md">Erin Wexler</a></span>—now this is the girl that was at the now infamous <span id="ent-gpe-hamptons-t-00-02-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-hamptons.md">Hamptons</a></span> retreat— She wrote this: "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-02-51"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> started her career by doxing teenagers." "Old habits die hard." That is just so weird. I just thought she, the <a href="/entities/gpe-hamptons.md">Hamptons</a> people, would be on this <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-02-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> thing, trying to help as best they could, but they're actually more concerned for these Egyptians who are renting a car, and therefore, since they don't even go here, like, why would this be identifying information? ^t-00-02-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-03-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=213" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Are you concerned for, like, Hertz rent-a-car? What are you concerned about here? We're not clear. Now, going back to what we've learned about this flight thus far, I want to remind you that we have confirmed that this was a full flight over to <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>. This <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> flight—and I'm referring to <span id="ent-work-su-btt-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/work-su-btt.md">SU-BTT</a></span>—landed in <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a> six days before <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination. So we are looking at anywhere between 12 to 14 quote-unquote Egyptians that were on this flight and deplaned on <span id="ent-date-september-4th-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/date-september-4th.md">September 4th</a></span>, okay? ^t-00-03-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-04-16.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:16</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=256" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** A high government source actually reached out and made me aware. And this is stunning, actually, that we missed this common sense. I should have figured this out all by myself. But there is such a thing as federal protocol. They told me this person in the State Department confirmed that a foreign military jet actually can't just land on American soil without <span id="ent-org-the-federal-government-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/org-the-federal-government.md">the federal government</a></span> paying attention. It actually requires a federal escort. Okay? Again, common sense. I don't know how we didn't think of this ourselves. Of course, if you're a military jet, you can't just fly into foreign land and hop off the jet and be like, "Okay, bye." "Just gonna do whatever I want." Of course, they're gonna go, "Am I high?" "Are we starting a war here?" ^t-00-04-16

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-05-00.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:00</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=300" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** "What's going on?" So this person tells me that, of course, that cannot happen. The government is immediately aware that this military-equipped plane is coming in, and an escort is provided because they want to know where they are going, what they are doing. So the question now is —and maybe <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-05-00"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash Patel</a></span> can help us answer this, just kidding, we know he won't—who were the federal agents that escorted these Egyptians off the plane? Okay, because they didn't just disappear into the ether. You guys knew they were coming in, and you watched them, and you knew what they were doing in <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-05-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>. ^t-00-05-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-05-38.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:38</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=338" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And by the way, while we're checking in on these unanswered questions, has <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> mustered the courage to answer my yes or no—circle yes or circle no—as to whether or not these <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> jets were known to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>? Because like I said yesterday, it is highly plausible, highly likely that they were. He had a photographic memory, and he loved planes. He loved learning about military planes. He would have recognized that that was circling around him a few times while he was on the road and circling around <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to make it very clear. Yes, this is a conspiracy. It is a federal-level conspiracy. It is likely an international conspiracy. ^t-00-05-38

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-06-18.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:18</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=378" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Multiple countries seem to be involved. And I really hate to upset the <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-06-18"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a></span> crowd any further—because I know I'm like your fave—but we now have identified a fifth verified rental plate that we can now add to the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-06-18"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> mix. So that's a total of five rental cars that were rented by <span id="ent-org-duncan-aviation-t-00-06-18"><a href="/entities/org-duncan-aviation.md">Duncan Aviation</a></span> that we can review. Also want to thank the many of you who emailed us yesterday and informed me that I apparently do not know the difference between the letter N and the number nine. I think I just was saying nine or N every time I was reading these plates, which means I'm probably not qualified to be homeschooling my toddlers. ^t-00-06-18

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-07-02.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:02</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=422" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Anyways, I was mixing that up. I'm not going to mix it up now. These are our five plates as follows: a white <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-07-02"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span> Toyota Camry. This had an <span id="ent-gpe-arizona-t-00-07-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a></span> license plate, and that number is CWN—like Nancy—9872, okay? Our second plate is a silver <a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a> Toyota RAV4. That is a <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-07-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> license plate, and that number is T092ZS. Okay. ^t-00-07-02

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-07-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=461" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Third vehicle that we have here is a white <span id="ent-date-2023-t-00-07-41"><a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a></span> Toyota RAV4, another <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-07-41"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> license plate. The number is T912KM. And we have a black <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-07-41"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span> Toyota 4Runner, <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a> license plate. And that plate is Z923DA. And we can now present to you guys a fifth car, which we know was rented. ^t-00-07-41

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-08-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=500" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That is a gray or silver <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span> Toyota 4Runner, <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> license plate number Z349AA. Five vehicles which were secured by <span id="ent-org-duncan-aviation-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/org-duncan-aviation.md">Duncan Aviation</a></span>. Now, since I wasn't born yesterday, I feel pretty confident concluding that these 12 to 14 Egyptians didn't drop into <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>, <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a>, in the six days leading up to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination to fix like a broken light on the plane, okay? Again, my source there is me not being born yesterday. ^t-00-08-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-09-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=545" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It's just not how it works. You cannot just get something very quickly fixed in a couple of days and be on your way. And like I said, they weren't even on the plane on the way out. They waited for that anchor plane, <span id="ent-work-su-bnd-t-00-09-05"><a href="/entities/work-su-bnd.md">SU-BND</a></span>, the other <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-09-05"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> military plane, to take them back home. So what are we looking at here? What exactly were these Egyptians with the federal escorts doing on the day of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination? Well, in terms of some potentially interesting leads, someone—many of you guys actually noted to us—that the cars that were in the driveway in the now infamous footage of the alleged shooter, right, which was somehow distributed by TMZ. We don't know how that happened. ^t-00-09-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-09-48.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:48</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=588" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Should probably be investigated further because that's a lot of cars in the driveway. And obviously every image that we have is blurred. Okay, it seems like we just can't get a clear image at all in this story. And so we cannot—it's impossible to discern anything— but it's therefore possible that some of those cars that we are looking at could be the rented vehicles, right? Maybe the one parked on the right there is the Toyota RAV4; maybe the two that look similar—one that's dark, one that's lighter—could that be the gray and the black 4Runner? I don't know, but that could be compelling. ^t-00-09-48

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-581dILVcEE4/t-00-10-23.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=581dILVcEE4&t=623" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That would be something that perhaps <span id="ent-person-joe-kent-t-00-10-23"><a href="/entities/person-joe-kent.md">Joe Kent</a></span> and <span id="ent-person-tulsi-gabbard-t-00-10-23"><a href="/entities/person-tulsi-gabbard.md">Tulsi Gabbard</a></span>—who are warring, or at least that's what the press said, warring with the FBI, or warring with <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-10-23"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash Patel</a></span>—could look into. Because this is <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-10-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span>, okay? This is <a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a>. And I also want to add here something that I have always suspected that makes perfect sense to me, which would be the reason that <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-10-23"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> has denied every request, not just to release footage of the day of the assassination, but also to release footage of the days leading up to the assassination. Why? I think it's because the footage that we have seen, right, was recorded before <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-10-23"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>. ^t-00-10-23

I always felt it was a distraction: the person in the staircase, walking across the street in two different outfits. I just felt that some of this footage was recorded in the days leading up, okay? And now, now that we know that those <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-11-07"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> planes came in six days before—six days before <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-11-07"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination—it's possible that they could have staged some of that, which they eventually edited maybe a bit and released it to TMZ in that timeframe. ^t-00-11-07

You may have lost—obviously a lot of stuff came out immediately—but what got lost in the fold was that there were eyewitness accounts of people having seen someone on that roof in the week before the shooting. This got buried in the press. There were students and allegedly a professor who reported seeing someone on the roof a week earlier. And I think we should try to track down these students.

I know at least the second time was last week, either Tuesday or Wednesday. Yeah. So last Tuesday and Wednesday, but they were on separate days. They were separate days.

But it was the same roof of the same building? Yes.

My bet would be that that's how the shooter got onto the <a href="/entities/org-lozier-center.md">Lozier Center</a> roof because that's... one of the few ways I know of. I guess there's also a ladder on the other side. As in that's how he got on yesterday or last week? Oh, well, last time I saw it, and he came off of there.

Okay. And he walked over that railing and started wandering around the ledge. Oh, OK. And facing which way? He was totally looking out in the direction of that fountain courtyard and out this way. The first time I thought it was a little weird, but didn't think much of it. Decided not to say anything, especially because another guy walked back. I think he was a professor. I don't—I've seen him around a lot more. And he comes from below, and he shouts up at the guy. He asks, "Are you OK?" The guy up there says, "Yeah, yeah, I'm doing fine."

I don't know why CNN declined to publish his name, but I was going to figure out who the student was, and I'm going to chase down this lead, and I want to open up that possibility because it is a possibility that the stairwell photo and the footage that we have seen of the shooter was actually recorded before the assassination. Of course, that's a possibility. In the absence of quite literally anything verifiable the feds have given us. Everything is therefore a possibility. So I want to also open this up because I don't want to just hear it from one student or CNN. I want to hear it from more students, right? That would be something that you would remember. We keep talking about what happened on 9-10. What about in the days leading up to 9-10? What about 9-6, right? 9-7, 9-8, 9-9. ^t-00-17-02

More tips at candaceowens.com because every time I have tried to chase down the leads regarding the rooftop, I am brought to a military person, and I just don't know that any of that actually took place on the day. And I think that's why they won't release any more footage. There should be multiple angles, right? If this all happened on 9-10, there would have been multiple angles, and they sure as hell would have released it in the middle of a manhunt, when you thought that he could kill other people. You would have released more footage. And they're not doing that, which means they're hiding something. And something that they could be hiding could be nothing. ^t-00-17-42

Also, I want to add on here that regarding the white RAV4, we got a lot of emails from the public that have noted that there appears to be what might be a RAV4 in every available footage that we have been provided of the shooter. So we've only seen four pieces of footage of the alleged shooter. One, of course, of him walking in front of—I think this was the house that <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-18-25"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span> was at.

Yep, that also could be a RAV4. And also, of course, the footage where he allegedly jumps off the rooftop. Many of you said it looked like there was a RAV4 pulling up. Look, yes, all of it's possible. Is it also possible that this is just a coincidence? Yes, it could be a coincidence. It also could be a conspiracy. We have to explore every lead because the feds are not—they are implicated in this cover-up. And this is how investigations work.

No. Also, you asked the police chief an either-or question. And I'm just kind of like trying to understand the basic construct of sentences. He said, "Got you covered." What does that mean? It was an either-or question. Either provide us access or get somebody up there. "Got you covered" means what? No follow-up. That's it. Millions and millions of dollars on his security annually.

We've gotten into this situation with that generation of young people because they have all been raised by Caesar, and we're wondering why they become Romans. We have abdicated our public school system to secularism, and it's the red-green revolution: where you take away with secularism the moral foundation, and then you come in with—whether it be Islam or ethno-nationalism—because we've gone through critical race theory, diversity, equity, and inclusion.

"If the planes are truly from the <span id="ent-org-egyptian-government-t-00-50-42"><a href="/entities/org-egyptian-government.md">Egyptian government</a></span>, would that mean their passengers in cargo would have diplomatic immunity and allow them to do illicit activities—espionage, weapons trafficking, et cetera—without much oversight?" You are on the right track. Certainly there are a lot of implications with why this plane would be allowed in and <span id="ent-org-the-federal-government-t-00-50-42"><a href="/entities/org-the-federal-government.md">the federal government</a></span> would escort it and then everyone would play dumb when <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-50-42"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> mentioned this flight being on the ground. It's interesting. Definitely more questions than answers, but we will have answers for you guys. ^t-00-50-42

That's another tip. You are correct, and I should explore that. They all said it was strange because they never had company over. You are absolutely correct, and I can try to hunt that down and see what I come up with for you guys tomorrow. Renee writes, "Talk to the neighbors." "They were complaining about many cars parked. That residents' possibly ring cameras will show the footage of those vehicles." I would imagine Kash has taken everything. I would imagine <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-51-27"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash</a></span> has taken everything. discover who murdered <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-51-27"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>.

So relevant timeframe would be from 9-4 up until 9-10, looking for these vehicles—these five vehicles that we have now shown you. L. Hodges writes, "I find it insane how influencers <span id="ent-person-tim-pool-t-00-52-11"><a href="/entities/person-tim-pool.md">Tim Pool</a></span> were speaking up against you regarding <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-52-11"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> and you no longer being invited to AmFest." Apparently he said something hurtful, and they said he can't go. Weird. I am not following what <a href="/entities/person-tim-pool.md">Tim Pool</a> has been saying. I know that he was kind of—he always kind of throws shade about me investigating things. I did see a clip on X that when we started this investigation of him saying people were doing it for clicks—which is just—I have no response to that. ^t-00-52-11

I have not sold anything with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-52-52"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s face or <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s name. I have kept up my job, which was always investigating—as I've been doing this entire year, the last two years— authentically.

And I can't win with these people. They say I have no proof, and I present proof, and they accuse me of doxing. They say I have no proof, and then I drop the text messages, and they're like, "How dare you share the private text messages." They're just lying. They are lying, and I am telling the truth. That's it. That's what's happening right now. ^t-00-52-52

Yes. <span id="ent-work-make-him-a-sandwich-t-00-53-36"><a href="/entities/work-make-him-a-sandwich.md">MakeHimASandwich.com</a></span> has the unsigned books. <a href="/entities/work-make-him-a-sandwich.md">MakeHimASandwich.com</a> has the unsigned books. Hope that helps you out. And you guys, thank you. Again, we're working on a very, very big lead tomorrow that I believe that we should be able to present tomorrow as we begin to sort through all of the planes that were flying on that day. Who was on each plane is now very relevant. As we take a look at this picture of why this <span id="ent-work-su-bnd-t-00-53-36"><a href="/entities/work-su-bnd.md">SU-BND</a></span> jet might have been transponding without moving at <span id="ent-org-duncan-aviation-t-00-53-36"><a href="/entities/org-duncan-aviation.md">Duncan Aviation</a></span>. ^t-00-53-36
