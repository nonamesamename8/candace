Are you buying that? Any buyers of that? I'd like to know because if there are, I'd like to inform you. I didn't want to say it this way, but I am in fact a Nigerian princess. I am stranded currently on an island. I'm gonna need you to send your credit card details right now so I can return home. ^t-00-00-00

He is telling me, plus other conspiracy theorists, to shut up unless we have the facts. Okay, Frank (Turek), challenge accepted. Let's learn some more facts today. Lastly, in case you missed it while I was away, they infiltrated our <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>. Our <a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a> has gone viral. My one safe place. I only had one safe space, and it was my <a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a>. And the <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> are now there. And they say—you guessed it—I am going crazy.

I want you to pay attention, very close attention, to what I'm about to share with you. A lot of this is gut instinct. That's what we do here. And I think it will change the way you think about the world. I'm gonna start by building upon what we discussed yesterday. I had mentioned to you all, honestly, that something was happening in April of <span id="ent-date-2018-t-00-01-36"><a href="/entities/date-2018.md">2018</a></span>. A lot of things actually were happening in April of <a href="/entities/date-2018.md">2018</a>, but of course hindsight is 20/20. And I'm going to share some things with you. I don't know what everything means, but I know that it means something. ^t-00-01-36

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-02-10.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=130" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Back when I did my initial tribute video to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, some people took issue theologically when I said that the day that <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a></span> tweeted, "I love the way <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span> thinks," <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and I freaked out because we were convinced that we had somehow manifested that. I'm aware. I received tons of emails. "This goes against Christian doctrine." This was <span id="ent-date-2018-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/date-2018.md">2018</a></span>. I was not a Catholic. And I think it's important to discuss that and why we thought we manifested that, because it is extremely relevant to what took place thereafter. I have to explain that moment to you. ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-02-49.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:49</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=169" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="claim-claim-33d431e12ed9-t-00-02-49">As I showed you yesterday, Charlie was having a lot of vivid dreams—dreams that he said he had throughout his entire life—that he was going to die in a really tragic, quick way.<a href="/claims/claim-33d431e12ed9.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> But especially in April, he was having vivid dreams that something big was about to happen. This is in the weeks leading up to the tweet, okay? Full stop. Charlie knew, and I felt, that we were on the brink of something big. Okay, you have to remember, we were young. I'm a lot older than Charlie. I was like 24 at the time, maybe even 23 years old at the time. And we were doing the <span id="ent-org-fox-news-t-00-02-49"><a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a></span> gambit—every show on <a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a>—but I was really just focused on <a href="/entities/org-black-lives-matter.md">BLM</a>, <span id="ent-org-black-lives-matter-t-00-02-49"><a href="/entities/org-black-lives-matter.md">Black Lives Matter</a></span>. I felt they were lying to Black Americans, and it was going to harm us. ^t-00-02-49

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-03-31.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:31</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=211" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Neither one of us was very well known at this time. We had just kind of gotten together the November before<span id="event-event-2017-01-01-candace-owens-meets-charlie-kirk-at-florida-confer-t-00-03-31"><a href="/events/event-2017-01-01-candace-owens-meets-charlie-kirk-at-florida-confer.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>. And it is just a fact that we were listening to <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-03-31"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a></span> music every day. I mean, literally every day—especially the song "Power," okay? I was telling Charlie, "Explicitly, we have to get to <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a>. I can tell by his music." This is what I'm saying to Charlie. "I know these lyrics inside and out. This person does not want to be a part of the system. If we can get to <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a>, I think he'll join my Blexit movement. I've got to wake up Black Americans to this scam that they're using our race to control our emotions, which now to me seems so minuscule because I see how much bigger the issue is. ^t-00-03-31

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-04-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=253" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But I just knew that <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-04-13"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a></span> was not a part of the simulation, so to speak, and that the song "Power," as <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a> said, is a battle cry to be yourself because of the lyrics. And I have this old text that I'm going to show you from Charlie. This is <span id="ent-date-april-13th-t-00-04-13"><a href="/entities/date-april-13th.md">April 13th</a></span>, <span id="ent-date-2018-t-00-04-13"><a href="/entities/date-2018.md">2018</a></span>. This is what I said to him just so you can kind of get the vibe of what was going on. I said, "Yo, <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a> writing a philosophy book called 'Break the Simulation.' We need him, Charlie. He is Blexit AF." And Charlie wrote back, "I love <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a>. He's my soul brother. I will find a way to him. I promise we have to." It's crazy to look at that and realize that he's about to tweet us—about to tweet me. ^t-00-04-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-04-52.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:52</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=292" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So there was this incredible buildup, and we felt this palpable energy, a shifting almost, that we<span id="event-event-2018-04-16-mike-cernovich-tweets-about-energy-shift-t-00-04-52"><a href="/events/event-2018-04-16-mike-cernovich-tweets-about-energy-shift.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> kept discussing in all the messages. We're like, "Something's happening in April. Something's happening." And then on April 16th, <span id="ent-person-mike-cernovich-t-00-04-52"><a href="/entities/person-mike-cernovich.md">Mike Cernovich</a></span>—you might be familiar with him—he does this series of tweets, having not spoken to me or Charlie about how we were feeling, saying that he was speaking to a lot of his friends who could feel that there was some sort of an energy shift happening. So you imagine, we're like, "What? There is something definitely happening here. How could <a href="/entities/person-mike-cernovich.md">Mike Cernovich</a> randomly be tweeting this series of tweets?" It shocked me. So I sent those tweets to Charlie. I'm going to show you that now. These are from <a href="/entities/person-mike-cernovich.md">Mike Cernovich</a>. He has since deleted these tweets, but you can ask him. ^t-00-04-52

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-05-36.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:36</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=336" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He wrote, "A change in energy." This is Mike Cernovich. "A change in energy which stuns high consciousness people does not mean bad. It simply means that it's cosmic. A paradigm is shifting. Something is happening, and that people get angry at me shows the shift." "Why care? The energy manifests itself in different ways." He goes on to say, "Several high consciousness people I've spoken to independently told me about feeling a shift in energy. Something is going on. It happened two to three weeks ago. I'm not talking politics or elections. It's much bigger. Energy shift." I saw this, and I obviously screenshot it. I sent the tweets to—not screenshot—I just sent the tweets to Charlie. And I said, "Charlie, what the F?" I had a bad potty mouth in <span id="ent-date-2018-t-00-05-36"><a href="/entities/date-2018.md">2018</a></span> going through these tweets. ^t-00-05-36

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-06-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=380" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I realized that. I don't swear nearly as much—or at all—anymore. And then Charlie said, "Yup, we felt it too. Remember I told you the dreams got darker." Again, I'm painting a picture here of what was going on. We're gonna get deeper here on what transpired. <span id="claim-claim-acb6502319ee-t-00-06-20">On the eve before <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-06-20"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a></span> tweeted us—again, we are still in April<a href="/claims/claim-acb6502319ee.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. This is April 20th, the evening before <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a> tweets me. Charlie messages me, and he says, "I'm on a run, and I'm blasting <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a>, and we're on the brink of something big, and like, this is our time." I'm gonna show you that text—night before. "I'm listening to <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a> and just running my streets. Are you ready for the war that's coming? ^t-00-06-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-07-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=425" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** We're going to fight. We're going to win. They will lose." I said, "So exciting. It's our time." He said, "Yes." And then the next morning, as you can see, I woke up to news of the tweets, and I said, "Please pick up," because I was shaking. And then Charlie wrote back and said, "I am freaking the F out." When I said to you guys, "You had to be there," we were certain we had manifested it. It was kind of freaky. That's the right word. We were freaking out, going, "How is this real? How did we know?" What is happening right now in the world? And yeah, <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-07-05"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span> sent this now infamous tweet. "I love<span id="event-event-2018-04-21-kanye-west-tweets-i-love-the-way-candace-t-00-07-05"><a href="/events/event-2018-04-21-kanye-west-tweets-i-love-the-way-candace.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> the way <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-07-05"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span> thinks." ^t-00-07-05

And retrospectively, it would never be the same again. It was indeed a paradigm shift. I mentioned to you guys yesterday that I remember that we both watched <span id="ent-person-scott-adams-t-00-07-44"><a href="/entities/person-scott-adams.md">Scott Adams</a></span>. I did not know who he was at this time. Again, I was very green, and I'm not an overtly political person. So I didn't know who <a href="/entities/person-scott-adams.md">Scott Adams</a> was, but I remember vividly watching him draw on a board and explain to his very many followers that something much bigger had taken place and that people needed to pay attention to this tweet for almost cosmic reasons. Let's take a listen to what <a href="/entities/person-scott-adams.md">Scott Adams</a> (<a href="/entities/person-scott-adams.md">Scott Adams</a> speaking) said on that day. ^t-00-07-44

He tweeted, "I like the way <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-08-30"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span> thinks." Seven words. And he ripped a hole in reality with seven words because <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-08-30"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span> is supposed to be over here, and <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> is supposed to be over here, and they're not ever supposed to say the other one said something right. All right, that's not supposed to happen. But <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a> did it anyway. <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a> knows history doesn't repeat. He's not a prisoner of the mind. ^t-00-08-30

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-09-14.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:14</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=554" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Scott Adams:** He knows that the problem is not the solution. Whatever you want to say about <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-09-14"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span>'s politics—and I don't even know what his preferred politics would be; I'm not even sure what party he would run for if he ran for president at this point— whatever else you want to say about him, and I don't know enough about his actual management skills or political ability, but he did something that you could rarely see. He actually just altered reality. He just made the entire conservative Twittersphere just go something like this. It's like your head just went, "What did I just see? ^t-00-09-14

Now forget about you know, which of these views you like the best. That's not even the story. Forget about whether you think Candace has everything right or everything wrong. That's not the story. The story is that these two people that shouldn't be in the same conversation—in seven words, <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-09-58"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span> just changed that. And he just freed a lot of people from a mental prison. ^t-00-09-58

And here's what I would tell you that happened thereafter in short order, because it was definitely something. I believe—and I'm saying this retrospectively—that from that moment onward, Charlie and I were assigned handlers. Okay, this is an expression that <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-10-48"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span> used to say: "I have a handler." I thought that he was just saying that. I thought that he was referring to just <span id="ent-gpe-hollywood-t-00-10-48"><a href="/entities/gpe-hollywood.md">Hollywood</a></span>. I now very much believe that I have had handlers since <span id="ent-date-2018-t-00-10-48"><a href="/entities/date-2018.md">2018</a></span>, and that things were done intentionally to pull me and Charlie apart. Now, I'm going to tell you how I remember it, in no particular order, okay? I tweeted back at <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a>, and I said, "Please take a meeting with us." ^t-00-10-48

He's the one that first invited me when I was going viral on <span id="ent-org-youtube-t-00-11-30"><a href="/entities/org-youtube.md">YouTube</a></span> to speak at his conference. You should also know that he is the father—or stepfather—to <span id="ent-org-andreessen-horowitz-t-00-11-30"><a href="/entities/org-andreessen-horowitz.md">Andreessen Horowitz</a></span>, the one that <span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-11-30"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Bibi</a></span> is insisting should be a part of this group that buys <span id="ent-org-tiktok-t-00-11-30"><a href="/entities/org-tiktok.md">TikTok</a></span> because—and this is relevant—they think it's important for warfare, psychological warfare in the future. It's relevant. Um, he was very nice in his message to me. He said, "Oh, my son knows <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a>, and I would like to facilitate that meeting." Suddenly they get <span id="ent-person-eric-weinstein-t-00-11-30"><a href="/entities/person-eric-weinstein.md">Eric Weinstein</a></span> involved, and he reaches out and he pretends that he wants to be a friend to me.

That's, I think, kind of relevant. And we were just so amazed by the tweet that we thought all of these people—like, this was just our moment, as in they really did just want to help. Another player in this was <span id="ent-person-rick-rubin-t-00-12-11"><a href="/entities/person-rick-rubin.md">Rick Rubin</a></span>.

To me, that's not nationalism. So in thinking about how we could go bad down the line, I don't really have an issue with nationalism. I really don't. I think that it's okay. It's important to retain your country's identity and to make sure that what's happening here—which I think is incredibly worrisome in terms of just the decrease in the birth rate that we're seeing in the UK—is what you kind of want to avoid. ^t-00-18-20

Why did they need this woman in?" Why were people researching these doctors and this specific medical examiner? What the heck is going on? There's more. There's a lot more that I haven't covered, but I'm painting a picture here for you, okay? I think the military industrial complex that <span id="ent-person-dwight-eisenhower-t-00-30-02"><a href="/entities/person-dwight-eisenhower.md">Eisenhower</a></span> forewarned of—the military industrial complex that shot <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-30-02"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span> to maintain power<span id="event-event-1963-11-22-jfk-assassination-t-00-30-02"><a href="/events/event-1963-11-22-jfk-assassination.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>—has created a veneer of reality for us, and it is not so, right? ^t-00-30-02

They weren't there until forces were trying to pull me and Charlie apart. I had it on my heart to share this with you because I think it will help you when you start to look at things and assess people, and they tell you, "He's a genius."

Each year, <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones or antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> to spend the following summer in the lush mountain pastures. When you purchase <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a>, you are not only supporting the 64 cowboys and their families who work on the ranch, but you are also supporting over 260 other U.S. ranches and the hundreds of American families who work on those ranches.

And by the way, the last thing—because this is part of the video allegations here—is that they're alleging that he was on the phone immediately. He was not. He was taking social videos, which he would send to our group chat, which we would then put on Charlie's social—why the event was happening—so you could see the crowd come in or his interactions. And we were only two questions into this event. ^t-00-40-41

He turns around, and it was so blaringly loud, I'm told. You would know this better than I do, but this is what I'm told. It was so blaringly loud, and he was so shell-shocked. He put his fingers in his ear, but his phone was still in his hand. He walks away—and he's... Not even walk. I want to... Because people are talking about that. The way it was is we had a cordoned-off area with rates, so you had controlled access. All the people—when this happens—they all get the idea we should leave before we are shot. And so there's a little narrow gap that I think people—it's not really walking. It's that everyone has to slow up to get through this little narrow choke point to get out of the area." ^t-00-41-19

And then once he got out into the distance—beyond Charlie, beyond the car that Charlie would be carried into—is when he called Erika first and then his father. That's what they tell us. Now, in regards to him saying that <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-41-51"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a></span> was taking social videos, I can tell you it tracks that <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> would be taking videos behind—like we know when Charlie first comes out of the event, he's throwing hats. That tracks. That definitely is a thing at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-41-51"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. ^t-00-41-51

I would have Savannah do this before <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-42-28"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span> did this. It was Sarah Schmackenberger. And they do that. They like the behind-the-scenes reactions. But in this particular video, he's not standing where you can get a view of Charlie asking a question. So this part is not tracking. Okay, <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> is not standing to the side of Charlie; he is behind. And so if you're saying what earlier—we're supposed to see him—the best place to stand if you're gonna get a video of Charlie asking a question is going to be in a place where you can see both Charlie and the person asking the question. And that's just not where he's standing. ^t-00-42-28

Now, maybe he's saying he was in—Mike—he was there when he was throwing hats out, and he was there trying to send videos thereafter once things got started. That's all possible. I don't know. Regarding him putting his hands up to his ear, it does sound completely plausible to me that if you first hear a gunshot, you're going to naturally do this. That kind of makes sense. You're gonna go, "What was that?" maybe. And then I think typically you'd get down. And the issue that I have is he just—I never see him take that phone down. Maybe he does, right? ^t-00-43-07

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-43-50.md" class="timestamp-link">00:43:50</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=2630" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Maybe he does. We don't know for a fact. And so we should be clear that it doesn't look to me like he's just covering his ears there, but maybe he is. What I will say is that it would be unlikely that you would keep holding your ears until you get all the way out and that you wouldn't duck down. And regarding "Charlie always told us to call Erika if anything happens"— yeah, that's kind of common sense. That's not exactly like, "Hey, if I get shot in the throat, don't help me and call Erika." I think obviously if— that's called like next of kin. Next of kin—if something happens to me, call George. ^t-00-43-50

It's very easy to dispel any internet innuendo. You don't actually have to jump into ad hominem attacks.

It was a ridiculous thing for her to say. I laughed at it. I wasn't upset about it, right? And I said, "This is crazy. Here is my phone. I'm live opening it for you." Why not do that?

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-50-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:50:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3043" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** A couple of psychological manipulations happening there. First is like the academic one, where he's trying to present himself as an authority on the topic and saying to you like, "There is no—you know—everybody can do anything when shots are fired. We don't know when you're shocked by shots being fired. Some people just—you know—start doing the hokey pokey." I mean, look—some people literally—they hear shots fired; they get on a table, and they start dancing and singing and saying, "Shoot me, shoot me." Like George Zimmerman—that's—"No, hey, we don't know. He was in shock." George Zimmerman—"I did it, I did it." That's a normal—"Hey, we don't know," right? Like, we do actually know that we all have a baseline response to danger. You run towards it because you want to rescue people. ^t-00-50-43

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-51-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:51:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3086" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** These are the heroes in the story. Or you run away from it. That's a baseline. Or you freeze. You literally just are paralyzed by fear, kind of. Maybe I'd say three baseline things that you can expect, right? "I don't know what to do. I'm running away from this. Or I know exactly what to do, and I need to rescue other people." So don't do that. The other thing he's doing, of course, is the biblical manipulation, which seems to me to be that there has been a military infiltration into the churches. I think we've covered that enough this year. I've turned that—Operation Mockingbird—where they just try to find some scripture and justify it. And he's a pastor. He's on trust. He's saying "she's judging people. The Lord says this. The Lord says she shouldn't look into the truth. ^t-00-51-26

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-52-11.md" class="timestamp-link">00:52:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3131" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The Lord says she shouldn't ask questions. The Lord thinks that people should just shut up," right? That to me is like the sickest form of manipulation. The sickest form of manipulation is to try to present it via the lens of what God would want. You don't have to do that. Just say what you think, say what you mean, and try to manipulate people the old-school way, okay? Now, speaking of psychological operations, the one safe place is my <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-52-11"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>, okay? I'm like, "We're real—like, you know—we're ratcheting in the <a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a>. I say whatever because I know people that are in there—they're ready for it. I'm throwing to them. We're talking about Frankism; we're talking about the Kabbalah; we're talking about the infiltration into the churches—intentional as an aspect of the Frankist movement. And we go pretty quickly. We're reading these books; we're learning about <span id="ent-person-sigmund-freud-t-00-52-11"><a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a></span>, right? ^t-00-52-11

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-52-51.md" class="timestamp-link">00:52:51</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3171" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It starts with <span id="ent-person-sigmund-freud-t-00-52-51"><a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a></span>. It ends with Operation Mockingbird—or that's where we are at right now. And I have so much fun. And what happened was <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-52-51"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> actually infiltrated the <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-52-51"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>, passed the <a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a>, and they then started sharing clips and watermarked it as if it was their own content to make money off of. This guy, MilkBarTV—I was like, "You're getting hit with a copyright strike, my friend," okay? Proud of myself. Hit him with a copyright strike 'cause he literally put "Milk Bar TV" content on the corner. He watermarked my content to then smear me, right? ^t-00-52-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-53-35.md" class="timestamp-link">00:53:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3215" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** If you're going to watermark my content, at least don't smear me and call me a crazy person. And what they were upset with was that I said that it was ridiculous. And I meant it, by the way. So shocking. I say what I mean: that we're supposed to think that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> is being honored because he got a <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-53-35"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> Day in October. I will feel <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> is honored, okay, when we figure out who killed him—because I'm not buying the lone shooter thing. So I said, "Miss me with the whole holiday theater. Tell me who actually killed him." And it's a typical federal maneuver, by the way, to kill someone like <span id="ent-person-martin-luther-king-jr-t-00-53-35"><a href="/entities/person-martin-luther-king-jr.md">Martin Luther King</a></span> or JFK, and then they get a holiday; they get a boulevard. That's what I said. And I would have said it off the <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-53-35"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>, but they clipped it, tried to take it out of context. But it's not <span id="ent-date-2018-t-00-53-35"><a href="/entities/date-2018.md">2018</a></span>, ^t-00-53-35

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-54-18.md" class="timestamp-link">00:54:18</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3258" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** and I am not new to what you guys do. These out-of-context clips are just not hitting the same. The people are awake. They know what's happening here. They see what you're doing. And then he cried, by the way, when he got hit with a copyright strike. I couldn't believe it. Talk about literally crying while you strike someone else. Like, you stole my content. You got caught stealing my content and trying to make money off of it. And then he tweets, "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-54-18"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span> hit my account." This is Nathan Livingstone. "I tried to steal, and she didn't let me. Why is she trying to silence me? Why won't she let me steal?" You can pay for a pass; you can watch it. But you can't steal my content. Anyways, guys, it's amazing. I think it's actually amazing that our <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-54-18"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span> got infiltrated. We're gonna have to be more careful in there. ^t-00-54-18

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-55-02.md" class="timestamp-link">00:55:02</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3302" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Just kidding. I won't be. I will be just as ratchet as I always am in the <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-55-02"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>. Lastly, we gotta get to <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-55-02"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a></span> because I think everybody now is really tired of her lying about having been born with a penis. Not my fault, okay? If you have not—by the way—watched the "<span id="ent-work-becoming-brigitte-t-00-55-02"><a href="/entities/work-becoming-brigitte.md">Becoming Brigitte</a></span>" series and you are appreciating what I'm doing with the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-55-02"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> series, go back and watch it. Same thing. All I did was tell the truth, and people were upset. And then the series went viral. I mean, by "people," I mean the media was upset. The series went viral. There's no way you can watch the series and come out of it thinking that <a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a> was born a female. You can't just disappear 30 years of your life. You can't just say, "I didn't take a picture for 30 years." It doesn't work like that. Okay. Such an easy low bar ever to set to dispel the rumors. "Hey, can we get some pictures from your wedding day? Like, you know, you with your family—and not just pictures that have been given to us from a woman who quite literally is facing charges for falsifying pictures? Like we've got like four photos of the whole life." ^t-00-55-02

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-55-46.md" class="timestamp-link">00:55:46</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3346" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And yeah, I'm being sued because that's the next logical step. You sue people for telling the truth to scare them. And it's all related, by the way. We're talking about who <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-55-46"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a></span> actually is, the families that <a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a> is related to, the fact that <span id="ent-person-emmanuel-macron-t-00-55-46"><a href="/entities/person-emmanuel-macron.md">Emmanuel Macron</a></span> is in fact—just like the state of <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-55-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>—a Rothschild creation; talking about the military industrial complex and talking about the Kabbalah. Kabbalah very much is the reason for this push in culture for <span id="ent-concept-transgenderism-t-00-55-46"><a href="/entities/concept-transgenderism.md">transgenderism</a></span>. We'll get more into that in the <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-55-46"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>, which gets a bit more theological. ^t-00-55-46

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-56-19.md" class="timestamp-link">00:56:19</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3379" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But that's a very important series. And basically what happened this week is people who hadn't even watched the series were like, "Okay, I've seen enough." <span id="claim-claim-6bf950666152-t-00-56-19"><span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-56-19"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a></span> crying because she doesn't know—<a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a> doesn't know why—but on the tax forms, the French tax forms, <a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a> is listed as Jean Michel and listed as a male<a href="/claims/claim-6bf950666152.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. So they're trying to lie and tell the public that they think this was done by a team of hackers. Okay. Hackers who they haven't arrested. ^t-00-56-19

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo/t-00-57-02.md" class="timestamp-link">00:57:02</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq7nj9rxPdo&t=3422" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay. Who—what hacker? By this happened years ago, right? It was actually someone who worked for her who said, "Oh, this is weird. Like, I'm in your account right now, and you're registered as a dude named Jean Michel." Mr. Brumetz was the guy who did this—a government official. He made the revelation, and he recounted how <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-57-02"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a></span> was stunned to learn that her legal name had been quote-unquote "changed" when she logged into her personal tax account. "We were completely surprised," said Mr. Brumetz. Oh, okay. <span id="claim-claim-7106fe2aeb16-t-00-57-02">So we're supposed to believe the government—which <a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a> is controlling, by the way—this person, Brumetz, has worked with the couple since <span id="ent-date-2017-t-00-57-02"><a href="/entities/date-2017.md">2017</a></span>.<a href="/claims/claim-7106fe2aeb16.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> And we're supposed to believe that a hacker was going to risk hacking the president of <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-57-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span>. Okay—the government had to be—the government decided to hack the government— ^t-00-57-02

Like, if you're gonna risk that kind of an offense—that's sort of a criminal offense—at least take the money. At least say, "And they wiped out $2 million." It was a crazy hack—a little joke at the end of it. But no—just wanted to hack and risk criminal charges to change your name to Jean Michel way back when, when this wasn't even a viral story. I mean, completely ridiculous. Okay, you were born <span id="ent-person-jean-michel-trogneux-t-00-57-42"><a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-trogneux.md">Jean-Michel Trogneux</a></span>. You transitioned, and you've been put in this position of power. And I don't know why they would do this. ^t-00-57-42

And you went after—I mean, he was a child in my view, in everyone's view—a 14-year-old kid. You got a 40-year-old adult that goes after him, and now you're pretending you're the victim, okay? A little bit crazy. We're getting tired of it. You can't just keep pretending everything is just happening to you. Just present some pictures. Stop pretending that you're offering genetic evidence in the court hearing against me. You're not even suing me for the claim that I said you were born a male. You're suing me for the claim that I said you stole your sister's identity to transition. That's what you're suing me over—amongst very many other things that are ridiculous. ^t-00-58-25

We have not gotten to any stage, actually. It's like the back-and-forth tit for tat—changing the filings—all very preliminary. You're just doing the most in terms of PR, trying to convince the world against something that we recognize, which is that you were born a male. So you may know what—come clean. Everybody—and I mean everybody worldwide—is exhausted with your wife's penis. We're gonna take a quick break and get some of your comments. All right, jumping in here to tell you guys about Comet AI because how much time do we spend on the web? How much time do we spend clicking around online—searching, scrolling, typing?

Well, there's now a new AI web browser from Perplexity that's called Comet, and it is completely changing the game. You can actually interact with your browser.

You might not have filed your tax returns just yet. The October 15th deadline has officially passed. If you forgot to file for an extension, if you haven't gathered all of your documents or made any estimated payments, you could soon be targeted by the IRS. We all know that.

The key to healthy skin is simple skincare routines. That's why I'm so interested in Nimi Skin Care. ^t-01-01-23

They've built one of their most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth, which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils, which means your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Nimi has two products from their tallow line that you should know about. First, your daily hydration: there's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light; it absorbs quickly, and it doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling on your skin. They've combined that with soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil. It's perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind. ^t-01-02-07

They have the <span id="ent-org-nimeskincare-com-t-01-02-49"><a href="/entities/org-nimeskincare-com.md">Buzzin' Tallow Balm</a></span>. It's an ultra-rich balm that uses tallow and beeswax to create a protective barrier. It locks in moisture and shields your skin from the elements, allowing it to heal. This is skincare the way that it was intended to be, which is simple, pure, and powerfully effective. It's a focus on skin-loving ingredients made right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-01-02-49"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>.

Thank you for helping me find faith again, and thank you for fighting for Charlie." Love that comment so much. Also, yes—Making a Sandwich. I'm so proud of this book. Please tag me when you get it. I get really happy when you guys tag me in the book because it really was a labor of love. Like I said, I wrote every word of this, and I did it outside of the matrix. So there is no book publisher that is involved and no mainstream Simon & Schuster person. We decided to self-publish, and we used actually an amazing Catholic book printer to do this. So I'm proud of that. Groovin with Christ writes, "I love that you are wearing the Miraculous Medal. Living in God's truth is like serenity on steroids. God bless."

And yes, it also helps the Catholic book printer that worked with us on this, and they were—like I said—phenomenal. John Diamond writes, "Candace, welcome back. We missed you, of course. I know you're catching up on current events. Let me summarize: Everything is still faking gay. Please give your husband and kids a huge hug from all of us. They are the ones who support you every day. Thank God for them. They are amazing." And it is because of my family that I genuinely like—I know that I was saved because I had the confidence to be more of myself when I married George, and he has supported me through everything and me never having the fashionable opinion. And of course, it impacts as a knock-on effect with the world that he knew. I mean, my husband—think about this. My husband used to work with—and he used to donate to—like the friends of <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-01-04-15"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> when he was in the UK, and he married me. ^t-01-04-15

Stuart Dillian writes, "Hi, Candace. Would you mind sharing your homeschooling plan sometime? My wife and I tried twice—traditional and unschooling—but it did not succeed. I'd love to know what's working for you. Thanks, and keep up the great work." First thing I want to say: it has been an absolute gift to have my kids at home. I can't explain to you—I am a happier person because of it. I can't believe we just send off the joy and go to work. Everything they say—it's so cute to watch the way their brains are forming and to realize that it's really hard to explain concepts when they take everything so literally. ^t-01-04-53

So like—I take the first two hours for the kids, but it is a family that has two kids that are around the same age, and then it's my two older kids, which are around the same age. And my other two are way too young. I have—you know—an infant, and I have a soon-to-be two-year-old, so they're not in it. Community—find a local community of people to do it with and figure it out. Obviously I am blessed, and I recognize that. But I get to work more in the afternoon, and I don't have to have the full eight-hour day. But you can figure it out, and you will be a happier person if you do. Mrs. Preppy writes, "Do you hold hope that the Trump administration could come through with justice for Charlie? What if Trump is considering reconsidering his love for <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-01-05-37"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> like Charlie? ^t-01-05-37

No, I don't hold out any hope at all, actually.

I think actually Don Jr. may have even said that. He accepts the narrative. I'll have to dig up that clip for you guys tomorrow. I have no hope whatsoever. ^t-01-06-20

The $100 million meant that he would allow them to annex—not Gaza—the West Bank. So all this chatter of "Oh, that would be a step too far—no, blah, blah, blah." He pre-agreed to that, and he's gonna make good on his pre-agreement. That's my perspective. Someone asked, "Did you background check <span id="ent-person-ian-carroll-t-01-07-05"><a href="/entities/person-ian-carroll.md">Ian Carroll</a></span>?" No. About to do his genealogy. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. RN Explorer writes, "Those hiding the truth better hope Candace does not turn out pregnant with a boy right now. I stand with the truth with Charlie and Candace." So true—you know me. I want hood rat stuff with my friends when I am pregnant with a boy. I need it all day, every day. ^t-01-07-05

You are fighting for Charlie just like he asked you." Quoting Maya Angelou: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time." "You have done that and more to bring truth to light. Charlie would be so proud." I know he's proud. I absolutely know that Charlie is proud, and that everything that we discussed—I hate that he was right about his life—but I also know that I'm the right person to do this because I came through that matrix, and I know what's up and what's down. Like, they just can't fool me with this stuff. You've done it to me so many times, and I survived it, and you can't do the thing that you always do, which is try to convince the world the person is crazy—because I'm not giving them that. ^t-01-07-48

You are gonna love it. It's a great gift to give to anybody. It's a very funny book; it's a fun book, and it's an informative book—which is really important. And women—I definitely think it is on us to learn the origins of the feminist movement because it's quite sinister. Everything doesn't look sinister, but of course it is sinister. And it's probably a part of the military-industrial complex. By the way—like I said—we restocked those cups. We don't know now, but CandaceOwens.com. It's another way you can support the show. Buy yourself a Candace cup. Other than that, you guys, I am just so grateful to you. Every single day, you are all in my prayers because I know that I am getting the strength from you.
