So we received a couple of weeks ago a very thorough tip regarding <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination and the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> planes. Now, what is even more compelling about this tip is that this individual who works with or for the government sent it before I had figured out that the <a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a> planes were tracking <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> and <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. Now, the individual also focused on something that at first seemed to me to be very micro to the situation, and now it seems quite macro. And it's an answer perhaps to the question: What was the <a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a> military plane, which left <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> on the morning of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination, doing in <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span>? ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-00-44.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=44" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Actually, we should figure that out. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. There are so many elements of this story that as time goes on are clicking into place. Things that initially maybe we don't consider, that you go, "Oh, wait a second. Why didn't I consider that right off the jump, right?" I was, of course, very surprised by the two <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> military aircraft that—in general—just, why were they there at all? ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-01-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=86" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And not even for one second did I stop and think, "Is this even a routine flight path at all?" Like, why would these jets—ostensibly filled with government-level Egyptians, right?—particularly the yellow jet, tail number <span id="ent-vehicle-su-btt-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">SUBTT</a></span>— which kept overlaying, sometimes even for days, in <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span>—why would they do that? Why would that plane be doing that? Let's pull up that timeline again that I put together for you guys of the blue jet and the yellow jet. And we—virtually in all the stops—you can just scroll through this. ^t-00-01-26

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-02-04.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:04</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=124" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Like, we kept noticing that that yellow plane was going through <span id="ent-gpe-paris-t-00-02-04"><a href="/entities/gpe-paris.md">Paris</a></span>; it was going to Wichita, but very often it was stopping in <span id="ent-gpe-wilmington-t-00-02-04"><a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a></span>. Like, what goes on in <a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a>, <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-02-04"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span>, actually? If you fly private—even if you fly public—it's not exactly a hub. People aren't like<span id="event-event-2021-01-01-wilmington-dassault-falcon-authorized-center-shuts-t-00-02-04"><a href="/events/event-2021-01-01-wilmington-dassault-falcon-authorized-center-shuts.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, "Let me route through <a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a> to go overseas." It's not a thing. The person who emailed me claimed to be a solid source on what that flight was doing. ^t-00-02-04

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-02-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=159" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And he—or she—claimed that he or she was so solid that they challenged me to find other people in government—people that were working in federal— and I did, people that I trusted. I went to, spoke with them, waited a while. That's why this email came in weeks ago, but we're just telling you about it now. And they confirmed that what this individual was saying was true, and that's why I am presenting it today, despite the fact that the person who sent this email was clear this information is quite dangerous. Now, to remind you guys so that you are understanding what we are working through here with a lot of information that is known to virtually none of us, ^t-00-02-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-03-23.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=203" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** On the morning of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-23"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination, the plane that had initially carried over the 12 or 14 quote-unquote Egyptians six days earlier—that plane, the yellow plane, departed on the morning at 7:14 a.m. local time from <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-03-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-03-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>. And it's headed to <span id="ent-gpe-wilmington-t-00-03-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-03-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span>. It arrived in <a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a>, <a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a> at 11:51 a.m. Eastern. So that's at around 9:51 a.m. <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a> time. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s gonna get shot at 12:23. This plane has landed into <a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a> at what would be 9:51 a.m., so about two and a half hours before <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> is shot. ^t-00-03-23

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-04-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=246" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And then for whatever reason, these Egyptians decided to stay in <span id="ent-gpe-wilmington-t-00-04-06"><a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-04-06"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span> for a night until the following day. I don't know, where did they sleep? Where did they go? Again, what goes on in <a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a>, <a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a>? Because they departed <span id="ent-date-september-11th-t-00-04-06"><a href="/entities/date-september-11th.md">September 11th</a></span> at 7:56 a.m.<span id="event-event-2025-09-11-egyptian-plane-subtt-departs-wilmington--t-00-04-06"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-egyptian-plane-subtt-departs-wilmington-.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> That means that we can definitively rule out that this was just a fuel stop, right? Nobody's like, let me fuel up my private military jet and sleep on the plane. So there was something in <a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a> that held the interest of our Middle Eastern people that are here for some reason. ^t-00-04-06

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-04-51.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:51</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=291" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Well, like I said, someone emailed us and we took our time vetting this tip because it seemed plausible, right? It seemed plausible to us that you guys are thinking maybe this was meant to distract us. We're going to run down this rabbit hole. And no, that's not the case. We vetted it across multiple government agencies and to really the highest levels of government. I've printed it out and I'm going to read around some parts, removing some parts to provide this individual, who by the way, I have no idea who this is, but to give him and her even some more coverage. Even though they said that they were very thorough in making sure I wouldn't get back to them, but you never know. They're taking a tremendous risk. ^t-00-04-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-05-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=333" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I'm just going to read this to you guys and I'm gonna read it slow for comprehension, because I had to read it slow myself for comprehension. It starts out with "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-05-33"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, I'm aware that you suspect the government and other entities are involved in the events leading up to and on <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-05-33"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>." "I'm aware that you also tied the plane, <span id="ent-vehicle-su-btt-t-00-05-33"><a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">SUBTT</a></span>, yellow plane, to this and that you are receiving tips." "You might have been wondering why <a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">SUBTT</a> made so many visits to <span id="ent-gpe-wilmington-t-00-05-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-05-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span> out of all places." "And I can personally answer that." "What I can say about myself is blank blank blank." I'm not going to read that. I'm not going to read that. I'm not going to read that. ^t-00-05-33

"That is not true." "The information I am giving you will implicate the FBI and various other government agencies all at the same time." "I am passing this to you because you are honest enough to see this for what it is."<span id="event-event-2024-12-05-fbi-director-christopher-wray-issues-press-release-t-00-06-15"><a href="/events/event-2024-12-05-fbi-director-christopher-wray-issues-press-release.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> "You may put this in your notes and reveal this pattern publicly," but this, and then he talks about why this information is dangerous.

"For me, this means that the arrival was processed under a diplomatic and dignitary category, which would not show up in the usual places." "That in and of itself wouldn't be odd if we were talking about Andrews or Dulles airports." "It's odd at <span id="ent-gpe-wilmington-t-00-06-58"><a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a></span>." "You can't verify this next piece directly, but I can independently." "I can confirm that blank uses vehicles which often leave and enter that airport when they do covert handoffs."

"Because of this, I can guarantee you that the vehicles affiliated with this workspace arrived and left inside the same window as <span id="ent-vehicle-su-btt-t-00-07-37"><a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">SUBTT</a></span>." "Government vehicles either pick up, monitor, or escort every government plane that lands there." "So that's the standard." "It's every single one." "Feds don't just leave foreign government planes unwatched." "It's a government plane, not a ghost plane." "Someone has to come out, and we all know they're not going to just call an Uber." ^t-00-07-37

"Nearly every federal vehicle that visits the airport will pass through King Street at least once because that is where the majority of the vehicles are ultimately stationed."

"That's why the fleet is either federal, unmarked, or local." "So when I say government vehicles, what I'm really saying is they most likely immediately swapped the plates for local, but they still had federal clearance." I'm gonna skip this because I think this could be... The whole idea is they get in, they have a meeting, they get out, the plates are then changed back, and they go back to a designated area. "However, sometimes it is decided that they need to have a meeting in a more convenient spot, a meeting that's not in a car." ^t-00-09-00

And the beef is processed right at the ranch in their award-winning <span id="ent-org-usda-t-00-25-08"><a href="/entities/org-usda.md">USDA</a></span>-inspected processing facility. So you avoid the costly middlemen because the beef is sent directly from <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> to your home.

The people that still believe, that are like true believers of one side or the other, true faith in government and experts, those people make me more nervous because some of them are smart. That's what's crazy. When smart people are completely unwilling to recognize that conspiracies are not just real, but they're also not rare. They're very common. They're common and people get away with them, especially when they're in positions of extreme power, like running intelligence agencies. ^t-00-36-38

Like, they can do it because they're allowed to, because they are a three-letter organization, and they have ultimate power to do a lot of, like, really gross things that are in the nature or in the interest of national security. So, like, this is the whole idea behind it. They say, like, this is our decision. This is the best move for national security. This is how we compromise assets. This is how we gather information. This is how we keep <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-37-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span> safe. It's like the <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-37-20"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span> files.

You guys would probably be in the streets violently protesting. You'd never send your kids into school. You'd avoid the government like the plague and you'd stop paying taxes. So we're just gonna classify that as a national security risk. That's kind of what that means, obviously. It means that what they are doing is so despicable that if we knew what they were doing, we would not listen to them. That's what that means. That's what that language means. That's why there's been so much protection over <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-38-01"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span> because that is who rules over us.

You know, a lot of people wrote that instantly they did this intentionally because you were on the track of <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-53-19"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a></span> we were getting real close talking about that <a href="/entities/concept-mkultra.md">MK Ultra</a> experiment that happened that I believe it looked very much like prisoner 2093 could have been <span id="ent-person-jean-michel-trogneux-t-00-53-19"><a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-trogneux.md">Jean-Michel Trogneux</a></span>.

And I, yeah, I don't know. We don't know. We are just following the actual evidence and investigating this. But a lot of you have sent in that those are your suspicions. We have no concrete evidence to prove that obviously. But I think we have enough evidence to suggest that this was multinational. At the very least, we can accept that this was an international operation.

It's one thing to know about the corruption, but when you finally know, know it, it sickens you to the core. God bless. Yeah. And we don't even... Like there's a lot more that many people are working on and we're all starting to connect the dots and it's decentralized. So I mean, like I said, what's the plan? They're just gonna murder us all in broad daylight. I shouldn't challenge them, but it does seem like a lot of people are now switching on and realizing this is sickening.
