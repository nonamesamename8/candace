**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. So we received a couple of weeks ago a very thorough tip regarding Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination and the Egyptian planes. Now, what is even more compelling about this tip is that this individual who works with or for the government sent it before I had figured out that the Egyptian planes were tracking Erika (Erika Kirk) and Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Now, the individual also focused on something that at first seemed to me to be very micro to the situation, and now it seems quite macro. And it's an answer perhaps to the question: What was the Egyptian military plane, which left Provo on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, doing in Delaware? ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=44" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-00-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Actually, we should figure that out. Welcome back to Candace (Candace Owens). There are so many elements of this story that as time goes on are clicking into place. Things that initially maybe we don't consider, that you go, "Oh, wait a second. Why didn't I consider that right off the jump, right?" I was, of course, very surprised by the two Egyptian military aircraft that—in general—just, why were they there at all? ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=86" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-01-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And not even for one second did I stop and think, "Is this even a routine flight path at all?" Like, why would these jets—ostensibly filled with government-level Egyptians, right?—particularly the yellow jet, tail number SUBTT— which kept overlaying, sometimes even for days, in Delaware—why would they do that? Why would that plane be doing that? Let's pull up that timeline again that I put together for you guys of the blue jet and the yellow jet. And we—virtually in all the stops—you can just scroll through this. ^t-00-01-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=124" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-02-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Like, we kept noticing that that yellow plane was going through Paris; it was going to Wichita, but very often it was stopping in Wilmington. Like, what goes on in Wilmington, Delaware, actually? If you fly private—even if you fly public—it's not exactly a hub. People aren't like, "Let me route through Wilmington to go overseas." It's not a thing. The person who emailed me claimed to be a solid source on what that flight was doing. ^t-00-02-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=159" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-02-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And he—or she—claimed that he or she was so solid that they challenged me to find other people in government—people that were working in federal— and I did, people that I trusted. I went to, spoke with them, waited a while. That's why this email came in weeks ago, but we're just telling you about it now. And they confirmed that what this individual was saying was true, and that's why I am presenting it today, despite the fact that the person who sent this email was clear this information is quite dangerous. Now, to remind you guys so that you are understanding what we are working through here with a lot of information that is known to virtually none of us, ^t-00-02-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=203" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-03-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, the plane that had initially carried over the 12 or 14 quote-unquote Egyptians six days earlier—that plane, the yellow plane, departed on the morning at 7:14 a.m. local time from Provo, Utah. And it's headed to Wilmington, Delaware. It arrived in Wilmington, Delaware at 11:51 a.m. Eastern. So that's at around 9:51 a.m. Utah time. Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s gonna get shot at 12:23. This plane has landed into Wilmington at what would be 9:51 a.m., so about two and a half hours before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is shot. ^t-00-03-23

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=246" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-04-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And then for whatever reason, these Egyptians decided to stay in Wilmington, Delaware for a night until the following day. I don't know, where did they sleep? Where did they go? Again, what goes on in Wilmington, Delaware? Because they departed September 11th at 7:56 a.m. That means that we can definitively rule out that this was just a fuel stop, right? Nobody's like, let me fuel up my private military jet and sleep on the plane. So there was something in Wilmington that held the interest of our Middle Eastern people that are here for some reason. ^t-00-04-06

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=291" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-04-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Well, like I said, someone emailed us and we took our time vetting this tip because it seemed plausible, right? It seemed plausible to us that you guys are thinking maybe this was meant to distract us. We're going to run down this rabbit hole. And no, that's not the case. We vetted it across multiple government agencies and to really the highest levels of government. I've printed it out and I'm going to read around some parts, removing some parts to provide this individual, who by the way, I have no idea who this is, but to give him and her even some more coverage. Even though they said that they were very thorough in making sure I wouldn't get back to them, but you never know. They're taking a tremendous risk. ^t-00-04-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=333" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-05-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So I'm just going to read this to you guys and I'm gonna read it slow for comprehension, because I had to read it slow myself for comprehension. It starts out with "Candace, I'm aware that you suspect the government and other entities are involved in the events leading up to and on September 10th." "I'm aware that you also tied the plane, SUBTT, yellow plane, to this and that you are receiving tips." "You might have been wondering why SUBTT made so many visits to Wilmington, Delaware out of all places." "And I can personally answer that." "What I can say about myself is blank blank blank." I'm not going to read that. I'm not going to read that. I'm not going to read that. ^t-00-05-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=375" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-06-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "Some people may tell you that SUBTT stopped at Wilmington because it was quote-unquote just maintenance." "That is not true." "The information I am giving you will implicate the FBI and various other government agencies all at the same time." "I am passing this to you because you are honest enough to see this for what it is." "You may put this in your notes and reveal this pattern publicly," but this, and then he talks about why this information is dangerous. So I'm going to skip and get to the information portion. The information portion reads this. "As you know, on September 10th, an Egyptian government Dassault Falcon 7X tail number SUBTT came into Wilmington, Delaware." ^t-00-06-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=418" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-06-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "I tried to pull non-public movement data, and it came up empty." "For me, this means that the arrival was processed under a diplomatic and dignitary category, which would not show up in the usual places." "That in and of itself wouldn't be odd if we were talking about Andrews or Dulles airports." "It's odd at Wilmington." "You can't verify this next piece directly, but I can independently." "I can confirm that blank uses vehicles which often leave and enter that airport when they do covert handoffs." "Now I have no affiliation with SUBTT." ^t-00-06-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=457" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-07-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "Nor am I an operator anywhere near Egypt or its planes, but I do know that only federal vehicles are allowed access to private gates housing government planes." "Because of this, I can guarantee you that the vehicles affiliated with this workspace arrived and left inside the same window as SUBTT." "Government vehicles either pick up, monitor, or escort every government plane that lands there." "So that's the standard." "It's every single one." "Feds don't just leave foreign government planes unwatched." "It's a government plane, not a ghost plane." "Someone has to come out, and we all know they're not going to just call an Uber." ^t-00-07-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=499" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-08-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "Given that I know most of the locations that these vehicles visit, I am entirely confident in stating" "that the plane and those vehicles are connected to 920 North King Street, which is at a place that is marketed also as one Rodney Square." "Nearly every federal vehicle that visits the airport will pass through King Street at least once because that is where the majority of the vehicles are ultimately stationed." "We do this because it is discreet." "The reason people don't know about this is because assets can be transferred to cars without diplomatic plates." ^t-00-08-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=540" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-09-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "You can't just do transfers with the diplomatic plates out in the open, or it would immediately tie assets to government." "That's why the fleet is either federal, unmarked, or local." "So when I say government vehicles, what I'm really saying is they most likely immediately swapped the plates for local, but they still had federal clearance." I'm gonna skip this because I think this could be... The whole idea is they get in, they have a meeting, they get out, the plates are then changed back, and they go back to a designated area. "However, sometimes it is decided that they need to have a meeting in a more convenient spot, a meeting that's not in a car." ^t-00-09-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=584" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-09-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "That is what I am telling you happened with SUBTT." "Obviously be impossible for me to show you the evidence of these activities because I obviously can't do that." "I obviously can't pull dashcam or cameras. But I am telling you that this is known among insiders and if you want confirmation you can ask Intel insiders of yours and they will confirm that that is exactly what happened. You may ask why this happened in the first place and I'll give you my best information and here is where it gets big." ^t-00-09-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=615" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-10-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "In June of 1997, the Department of Justice's own directory lists, quote, Wilmington Residence Office, 1 Rodney Square, Suite 404, 920 King Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801." "That is your line to know that it is a federal resident office that is at that exact address." "You can open it yourself in this link and look for a page titled 675." Okay? We did that. We confirmed that. "Wilmington Resident Office Suite 404 1 Rodney Square." And so we can confirm this is like he says or she says the Department of Justice's own directory list. Okay? ^t-00-10-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=660" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-11-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Today, if you punch that address into public directories, you will find the DEA, Drug Enforcement Agency, at 920 North King Street, and at the same address, the United States Secret Service, 920 North King Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801. Both are live, both are at Suite 404, both also publish phone numbers. In the Secret Service case, the agency's own 2025 field office list still shows Wilmington, Delaware. That means the suites that the Department of Justice owned in the 1990s never actually went away. ^t-00-11-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=700" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-11-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** This eventually evolved into a multi-agency space in a commercial building. The building looks like if you decided to cut the 33 Thomas Street building in half. Seriously, if you Google image 33 Thomas Street in New York City, that's the building that Snowden leaked. Find one that makes it look brown and then compare it to 920 North King Street in Wilmington. It looks exactly like a mini version of the thing. The only difference is that 920 North King has glass windows. Now, you saw people on X saying that SUBTT has an alibi because it, quote-unquote, aligns with a long-standing Falcon maintenance arrangement out of Wilmington that dates back to 1999. You remember that, guys? ^t-00-11-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=743" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-12-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** They told us, oh, they were just doing maintenance. This is maintenance here, maintenance there, scheduled maintenance. That's the part that really sent me because I know that's the part that really sets me off because I know that you are right about the plane and I also know the truth about this plane. Yes, Wilmington used to have a Dassault Falcon authorized center, but it shut down around 2021. Then, and this is verifiable, in December of 2024, a French aircraft finishing company called Satys, S-A-T-Y-S, announced that it was taking over the shuttered Wilmington airport hangar. And every Delaware outlet said the same thing. ^t-00-12-23

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=788" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:08</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-13-08.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Satys will invest a little over $1 million and get this. So you see that we are pulling that up. We have confirmed that that is true. This is a French company that said they were going to take over this hangar in Wilmington. The Delaware River and Bay Authority is the one that is making that deal. DRBA is a bi-state authority, except the key part is that it operates on federally regulated airways or waterways, pardon. ^t-00-13-08

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=817" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-13-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Its own January 2024 resolution says that it was, quote, acquiring the rights to a paint hangar currently part of a Dassault leasehold and authorizing the executive director and board chair to execute that lease with Satys. So that is a River Bay Authority, the DRBA, that is executing an aviation lease on a field that sits on a navigable corridor. That automatically puts it in the orbit of a federal system. ^t-00-13-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=849" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-14-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The chain here that would report from the people who control the rivers would be DRBA to the Army Corps of Engineers, the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of Defense to the President. So now you can say with complete honesty that the federal government was aware of and signed off on the plane and hangar situation. Now, I'm not claiming a direct line of authority for that. I'm saying that anyone who tells you that the influence is not there is either misinformed or lying. I'm also not saying that POTUS himself did this, but the government was undeniably involved with that hangar and the plane that you are eyeing. Not to mention, Representative McBride is the state-wide rep for that place. Again, I'm not saying that McBride has anything to do with this because I wouldn't know that, but it is noteworthy. ^t-00-14-09

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=893" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-14-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** What you can honestly say, though, is this. If SUBTT has been doing this run for decades, it could not have been using a 2024 French finishing lease as its maintenance justification. In fact, your own timeline shows how they traveled to France before the deal was even made. It proves that the maintenance story is nothing but a cover. That hangar is undeniably either another site in of itself or it is a front for something else. Back to 920 North King Street. When you Google FBI Wilmington Resident Agency, you should check the address in the Google info panel. ^t-00-14-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=937" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-15-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You will likely get 920 North King Street with the label Federal Bureau of Investigation. Instead of the public FBI address that's at 500 Delaware Avenue, Suite 300, which is just a bank tower, you can confirm that 500 Delaware Ave is the borough's public-facing spot, but Google will tell you that 920 North King Street is also the FBI. That is not a mistake. The FBI is also stationed at 920 North King Street. They list it straight in the DOJ's 1990s directory. Further, the Secret Service is not a part of the Department of Justice. They are the Department of Homeland Security. ^t-00-15-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=974" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-16-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So this actually seems to be a joint DOJ DHS site, which verifiably houses three different agencies and possibly more all at the same time. I've looked for a while and to this day, I don't see any other location that does that. I guarantee you've never personally heard of a federal site operating like that either. No matter what anybody tells you, if they say they lease like that all the time, that is not a justification. Multiple agents of multiple different agencies in one suite is not common or typical in the slightest. ^t-00-16-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=1011" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-16-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** A joint office is common, but there's a line to draw between a joint office and at least three different agencies alongside contractors all operating in one place. Also, take a look at the borough's own press release from December 5, 2024. Christopher Wray, quote, met with key partners and stressed how critical FBI partnerships are to protecting our communities. They chose to mention partners. They didn't say that he met with agents that were assigned in Wilmington. They foregrounded partnerships. ^t-00-16-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=1044" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-17-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's the vocabulary that they use when the space is not purely FBI and it lines up with what is actually happening at 920 North King Street, which is the FBI, the DEA, and the USS, the United States Secret Service, and others are working together in a commercial tower. Here is the link for that press release. In that link, Wray confirms that the place houses private partners as well. He says, quote, if you step back and look at how much closer our partnerships are now than they were five or 10 years ago, it's a defining trend. "I think of significance of this positive transformation." ^t-00-17-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=1084" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-18-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "We have an entire generation of law enforcement and the private sector working together, trying to figure out how to help each other and to have each other's backs." Yeah, to have each other's backs. So let's recap these facts. On September 10, an Egyptian government aircraft with a history of flying to France and the United States lands at a small Delaware airport under a French company maintenance pretext that doesn't actually match the hangar timeline, because the French visit predates the French company's deal. Within an hour, federal SUVs move from that airport to 920 North King Street. ^t-00-18-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=1127" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-18-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** 920 North King Street has been a federal resident office since at least 1997, and today it houses the DEA, the FBI, and the United States Secret Service all at the same address. The hangar the plane would have used is controlled through a DRBA lease that itself is nested in federal waterways. The FBI also publicly talks about key partners in Wilmington on the same year that the hangar reactivates. I'm going to skip this next portion because he tells me how I can verify this. And like I said, I did that. Once more, go through this logic and ask yourself how this makes any sense. ^t-00-18-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=1166" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-19-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** On November 13, 2022, SUBTT flies from Cairo to Paris to Wichita, Kansas, to Wilmington, Delaware, back to Cairo. That is already a four-legged two-continent hop that ends in Wilmington before going home. Four days later, on November 17th, 2022, it does Egypt to Wilmington, again, departing at 8:54 a.m., and this time it stays in Wilmington until November 20th. And only then returns to Cairo. So that is two Wilmington arrivals in the same week. Nobody burns a government Falcon 7X on two separate Wilmington runs for no reason. ^t-00-19-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=1211" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:20:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-20-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I mean, just look at the choice of St. Louis, Wichita, Omaha, Lincoln, Williston, Minot, and Provo. None of these are standard diplomatic hubs. Most of those don't even have major consulates. And absolutely none of them are known for large-scale Egyptian presence, so that immediately undermines the whole, it's just a maintenance stop excuse. Ask yourself, why else a state aircraft would hopscotch across America to remote cities if its purpose was just servicing at a defunct Wilmington Dassault Center? Wilmington is undeniably a terminal point and the only logical reason points to 920 North King Street. I could go through all of the dates and do this, but you already mapped the flights, so you already understand exactly what I'm saying. ^t-00-20-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=1255" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:20:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-20-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "Obviously, I can't tell you how I know this or who I am or exactly who it is that I work for." "My motive is simply that I can no longer keep this stuff in my head anymore." "I just need somebody with a history of doing the right thing and figuring out the entire truth."

I think we deserve to know why. And instead, we're gonna be sued, I guess. Is this gonna be the pathway forward? Are you gonna start murdering more people in broad daylight for knowing?

If you haven't tried Riverbend Ranch's steaks, it is time that you did. I've never had a better steak in my entire life. For the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. ^t-00-24-32

Each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. All of Riverbend Ranch's cattle were born and raised right here in the USA. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. And the beef is processed right at the ranch in their award-winning USDA-inspected processing facility.

It's safe, it's trusted, and it is produced right here in the United States. Ivermectin has been prescribed globally for more than 30 years and even earned the Nobel Prize in Medicine for its proven ability to eliminate parasites and support overall health.

And I'm gonna call these our green planes. Green means go. These are the planes. And I've already mentioned to you guys this first one. That we ended up discovering was related to—this is the Cessna Citation that holds seven to eight passengers. That's the one that departed from Scottsdale at eight o'clock a.m., landed into Provo at 10:06 a.m. ^t-00-27-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=1671" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:27:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-27-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And then it immediately departed for Santa Barbara, landed into Santa Barbara and immediately departed for Scottsdale, landing into Scottsdale at 12:44 p.m. So just after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got shot because that's Scottsdale time. I am curious about who was on that plane because we can attach that to Turning Point USA. Turning Point USA is featured on T.W. Lewis's foundation website. They are partners. They have given to Turning Point USA and that flight feels very important to me. ^t-00-27-51

The next flight is the 15 to 16 passenger flight. That's a big one. That was Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s plane that day first took him to Salt Lake City for the Restaurantology interview that he did, his last interview. And then after he gets shot, which makes sense, somebody sent it directly, I'm assuming this might have been what Mikey McCoy coordinated, sent it straight to Scottsdale. And I would like to know who specifically got onto this plane. ^t-00-28-27

That's actually quite late. I want to draw your attention to that. That's a smaller airplane and it's quite late because that's going to be 3:19 p.m. Utah time. That's three hours after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got shot. That person is just leaving Santa Barbara. Passengers don't know. Here are the passengers that we know came from Arizona and potentially Santa Barbara. Andrew Colvett, Andrew Colvett's wife. We have a priest. We have Stacey Sheridan, who's the chief finance person. ^t-00-29-09

We have Elizabeth McCoy, the amazing Mike McCoy's wife. We have Tyler Bowyer, we have Erika (Erika Kirk). There could be more people. We need to focus here. There's a fact that's not connecting for me when I look at this, a fact that I have about how things were running that day. And so if you have information, maybe you're at Turning Point USA, at who left at what time, Turning Point headquarters, Elizabeth McCoy screamed, she grabbed her phone, she ran out. Mikey probably called her, that would make sense. And that's about 30 minutes away from the airport. ^t-00-29-52

Now, our list of Turning Point lies is just getting longer every day. Yesterday we talked about Brian Harpole, the security guy who was not convincing at all. And he basically said, we didn't have drones because, looking at the rooftops, because I wasn't allowed to have drones, right? We just were not allowed to have drones that day. ^t-00-30-31

Again, going back to the early interviews that a lot of TPUSA people gave, Frank Turek, who was with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), he died with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in the hospital, and carried Charlie (Charlie Kirk) into the waiting SUV, he told Megyn Kelly something different about drones on that day.

He said, Frank, if you can come help me the first couple of days, could you stay an extra day and come with me to the first event? I said, of course. So we're driving in Megyn and his team has drones up looking at the crowd from above and they text him some video. And there's thousands of people there an hour before the start. And I said, Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I don't like this place. There's too many buildings. And, uh, but he shrugged it off. He knew there were thousands of people there and he knew in order to minister to people, you can't completely isolate yourself. It's just like love.

You see, I used to lay in my grandma's bed and watch Judge Judy with my grandma growing up. And a lot of it, actually, my grandma had a bad hip. So she sometimes had surgeries and we'd watch Judge Judy. And I remember in my brain, maybe Judge Judy made me like this, I don't know. But she used to say, if you lie, you better have a good memory. That's the problem with lies. You gotta have a real good memory to lie when you're telling the truth. You don't have to have a good memory because it just happened. So you just say it. And Turning Point is not having a very good memory right now. And it's hard because they did so much speaking in the aftermath that they can't go back and delete files. And so we can add that to our list now of verifiable Turning Point lies. ^t-00-32-30

By the way, elsewhere in that interview with Brian Harpole, the security guy with Sean Ryan, he reiterates, he doubles down on the idea that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ate 3,000 pounds of energy coming at him.

Holy shit. Yeah, it's like, why not put that info out? Why not put it out? And then why wouldn't they put that out in it? If it do me a favor, don't make me do it. It's not my job.

It's like I'm sitting back here when people are saying we bombed him or there's a wound. I'm like, hey, somebody from an official capacity would just release that.

That's like the Utah state policy. If he's suggesting that the feds are blocking her from doing that, I mean, he's in that statement, why not just release it? They could in theory just release it. And yeah, it's not gonna jeopardize anything. The reason they're sending you out to do it is because they don't wanna be caught lying themselves. The feds have told a ton of lies. That's the problem. And they don't want to add to it, so it's easier to sit down a security person and say, well, we never said that. He said that. If what he is saying is true, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wasn't shot by a .30-06, which we've been telling you from the beginning. We've been telling you Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was not shot by a .30-06.

Okay, a smaller caliber. Either or, you get to decide. You get to decide whether Salad can do that. You get to decide whether you're accepting the Popeye the Sailor Man narrative and he ate spinach.

That's what's crazy. When smart people are completely unwilling to recognize that conspiracies are not just real, but they're also not rare. They're very common.

It means that what they are doing is so despicable that if we knew what they were doing, we would not listen to them. That's what that means. That's what that language means.

I told the truth about the Brigitte Macron story, right? And like I said, the fact that they are caught and their move is we're gonna sue Candace Owens. That really tells you the nature of the psychopathology. Like, these people are not human. Do you know what I mean? They're not human. There's something very dark and sinister and wrong that nothing stops them. They have no shame. And their only option is more anger, more destruction. And in some circumstances, people with that much power, in a lot of circumstances, more murder, more murder. And I will never get over the fact, by the way, that ^t-00-40-48

They wanted us to see it. That is something that truly disturbs me on every level to consider that they wanted us to see it and then they wanted to spend money on a psychological campaign to tell us that we were wrong for seeing it and thinking about it and not accepting the narrative. Like, that really gets to the heart of the disturbing corruption and psychopathic nature of our governments worldwide. I just want to say that, okay? Now, in funnier news, if you think that by not acknowledging conspiracies, you're somehow going to be spared by them, you're obviously very wrong. ^t-00-41-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=2531" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:42:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-42-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** If you join the corporate, the experts, and try to throw mud at people who are speaking about the obvious lies, eventually, you will get swallowed by them. That's how it goes. You know, you sell your soul to the devil, eventually, you'll get swallowed by it. Now, that's not a way to say that Tim Pool sold himself to the devil. He's a bit of a fence-sitter. I like Tim Pool. He's always been good to me. But when it matters, he will always just take like a little dig. And he kind of did that when I started investigating the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) series. And he kind of said, oh, well, now you're number one podcast and you should be more concerned about Harmony. As I started saying that the donors were squeezing Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Like that's the main thing. This is a part of the story. Like donors were getting very angry with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-42-11

Anyways, let's watch Tim Pool in quick succession. ^t-00-42-54

Now, two months later, the narrative has turned into conspiracy drama about Charlie (Charlie Kirk), if Turning Point was involved in it, references to Jewish donors pulling out and how Erika (Erika Kirk) knew everything, and that's the narrative the number one podcast has given us. ^t-00-43-16

Why? Maybe it's because I said we should stop funding Israel. Maybe it's because I said we shouldn't be giving money to Ukraine. Maybe it's because young people largely don't want foreign intervention, and there are individuals in politics who disagree. ^t-00-43-44

And I do that in friendly jest, but that's the point. Like just you got to go after the thing and talk about what's real because there was an infiltration happening at Turning Point USA. It's still happening, obviously. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was in the way. And this is relevant. It's all relevant. We have to understand exactly what happened in the months leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination to understand a fuller picture. To try to get to what the truth is. And yeah, anyways, I thought it was very funny when I saw that happen. Not like funny that you didn't get invited. It happened to me the year before. That's it. The donors squeeze him. They don't like one thing you say. You get put on a list. Financial threats are made. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was standing up for himself. So, but I do think it's funny that you learned this lesson the hard way. ^t-00-44-04

We will get to a couple more sponsorships before I answer some of your questions and comments. All right, you guys, you've heard me speak a lot about Neeme Skincare. I love what their three-step anti-aging routine has done for my skin, which is why I'm also excited that Neeme Skincare now has a complete body line as well, their Foundations body bundle. It's a simple three-step routine. You get the Botanical Bliss body wash to gently cleanse with soothing botanicals, the revitalizing sugar scrub to exfoliate and hydrate with vitamin C plus coconut oil, and the restorative body lotion to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy. And just like their facial skincare, the Neeme body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients. ^t-00-44-47

So finally, you can stop supporting radical corporations and give your money to a company that actually honors you. It's time to care for all of your skin with products you can trust. Head to neeme.com and use my code CANDACE10 at checkout for 10% off your entire order. That's neeme.com. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing because the Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that is great news for American homeowners. If you are feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time right now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is so expensive and your credit cards are already being pushed to the max. With rates dropping, now is the time to pay off that debt. ^t-00-45-30

They're saving people, just like you, an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in the low fives, which is a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before we know it, so do not wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today. You can call American Financing at 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210, or visit americanfinancing.net/owens, americanfinancing.net/owens. All right, you guys, some housekeeping.

Is from Yearning for the Truth from yesterday's episode. This person writes, There is a current propaganda campaign going on at Calvary Chapels where Israel is directly sending money to an LLC in San Diego by the name of Show Faith by Works. This LLC is working with churches to promote an October 7th experience. ^t-00-46-56

I sent you the official far document via email where their entire plan is laid out. Yeah, this is this is like MK Ultra. These are basically there's these are government and military experiments. It's like how many times can we tell you that Israel is a victim before you believe it? How many times can we tell you that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Nothing happened weird on that day. And it was just a lone shooter before you believe it. I think they have stretched this campaign to its max. ^t-00-47-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=2895" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:48:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-48-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I don't think more people, the more money they spend and the more magazines that they print at a church are being drawn towards Israel. I think they're realizing something is very wrong. So it's having the exact opposite effect. And for that reason, I encourage it because we have to wake up to what's going on. We've all been asleep at the wheel. We've all been victims of psychological campaigns one way or the other. I mean, what was it? A couple of years ago, I was right versus left, left versus right, Democrat versus Republican. And I'm going, what the heck is this evil at the top that rules over the rest of us? We have to come together. That is the only way that we can undo this matrix, truly. And I do want to say this from my heart. ^t-00-48-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKGUzGHymcI&t=2936" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:48:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-SKGUzGHymcI/t-00-48-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I know what I saw in that vision that I told you guys I had in the days leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination that made me pull my kids out of school. I kind of know where the story is going to end and I would like to again use my platform to encourage you to take your children out of government schools and home school your kids. There is something much darker going on in this nation and I believe that our children are at risk in government schools. And I just have it on my heart to keep saying that to parents to understand this thing is really ugly. It's very dangerous. And what I effectively feel are sleeper cells all across the nation. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) hopefully will catalyze your understanding of that. Something is very wrong. ^t-00-48-56

And they are, like if you were in my book club, you understand this, they are trained psychopaths like they conducted experiments to figure out how to make somebody grow up to be a psychopath. And that's what we're seeing. These are people that are in power. Sigmund Freud explicitly spells that out, that doing these things to children, they will grow up and they will be a psychopath. They've understood this. Just want to say that. Protect the children. That is the most precious resource. Moving on, Laughing Cats Music Worldwide. Wow, thank you. That is a very tremendous donation that you just made to us. Up until Andrew Colvett told us that we had to believe in Miracle Vertebrae, I was a devoted TPUSA donor and a show member. ^t-00-49-41

I feel like their wheels are coming off with Shady People and financials. Go Max, Candace. Besides the pastors, the rabbis, the influencers, and the politicians on X, the rest of the world is with you. Yeah. I know that and I also know that this is my mission. Like I just spiritually know that this is my mission to help awaken, to help further catalyze this global awakening that we're having and whatever part I play in it, so be it. I just want to get into heaven and I'm not going to get there by making deals with the devil. You perceive your own safety by just going along with it, but there's nothing that could be less safe than allowing evil to continue to rule because you fear it. It's only going to get worse. It's only going to get more demented. ^t-00-50-25

Ev 3031 writes, and this is thank you. That's another major donation. They divided us so that we would never talk, never think, but open minds will always find truth. Thank you, Candace, for going deep and showing what real critical thinking looks like. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk), he found out what we have known for a while and he has connected those dots. He can't say it, but we know now. Yeah, deep down, I think we do know what this is really about. Soul Survivor writes, Calvary Global Network branched off from Calvary Chapel Association in 2017. Much like they infiltrated TPUSA, they started branching out into separate things. I sent in a tip about Calvary Global Network and you may find it interesting. ^t-00-51-10

It is always about infiltration and I have to say I can't change what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) but I just wish I was there because I always warned him about certain people. This very people that the world has now kind of switched on to and going what's up with these people. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was just so motivated and I think that he acquitted more dollars with more success and didn't acquit necessarily with more of a threat. But Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not die in vain, obviously, because we are having this conversation because of what happened to him. Bigfoot Believer writes, with everything that you've uncovered, is there any chance our extremely unserious government will ever prosecute Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s killers? If not, Kash Patel's FBI may be the next. ^t-00-51-52

Go Max. I was very clear. I'm not voting until they tell us what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), why it happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), why it had to happen to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Yeah, I'm just out. And I don't really care what anybody has to say about that. I would say no. By the way, they are prosecuting regarding Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s girlfriend. She hit us with a strike on YouTube. It wasn't a strike. We got a... I don't want to mischaracterize it. Copyright claim for her sensational music. And so we might have to trim out that sensational song from the Tim Dillon clip that we showed of him listening to it. So. Oh, sorry. ^t-00-52-35

I meant Kash's girlfriend. Thank you for correcting me. Bigfoot Believer. Oh, sorry. Elodium writes, my bet is it's connected to the Macrons. They rang the MK Ultra Red phone to get you off their backs. Plus, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was now an issue to them. One stone, two birds. It's just me thinking out loud and speculating, but... You know, a lot of people wrote that instantly they did this intentionally because you were on the track of Brigitte Macron we were getting real close talking about that MK Ultra experiment that happened that I believe it looked very much like prisoner 2093 could have been Jean-Michel Trogneux. And then this happens. And I did not at all think there could be a connection, but this French angle is weird. ^t-00-53-19

And I, yeah, I don't know. We don't know. We are just following the actual evidence and investigating this. But a lot of you have sent in that those are your suspicions. We have no concrete evidence to prove that obviously. But I think we have enough evidence to suggest that this was multinational. At the very least, we can accept that this was an international operation. Raymond Rorah writes assassination or more about what one plans to do, not what they have done. Lincoln's plan after freeing the slaves, relocation. Kennedy's plan to deal with the military industrial complex. What was Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s plan after the Doge investigation? There is the answer. ^t-00-54-00

Yeah, it's a lot of stuff to think about and I think about it constantly. I'm obviously obsessed with this case. Miss Heather writes, Candace, I had to mute and sit in silence to process all of that. It's one thing to know about the corruption, but when you finally know, know it, it sickens you to the core. God bless. Yeah. And we don't even... Like there's a lot more that many people are working on and we're all starting to connect the dots and it's decentralized. So I mean, like I said, what's the plan? They're just gonna murder us all in broad daylight. I shouldn't challenge them, but it does seem like a lot of people are now switching on and realizing this is sickening. It should sicken you to your core. That means that you're a human. It means that you have a soul. ^t-00-54-45

Jennifer Kay writes, Candace, keep going, Max. Zamet writes, Candace, go Max. Worldwide evil has no borders. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is watching you with pride. I know he is watching. I know that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is proud of me. And he knew that I would do this. That gives me tremendous comfort. Caribou writes, praying for you and your family and standing with you in truth. And Janellen writes from a Cuban who opened up her eyes. Thank you. Gracias, Candace Owens. Love that. Well, you guys, we will see you tomorrow. Don't forget that we have book club at 6 p.m. Eastern.
