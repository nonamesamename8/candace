First and foremost, what always stood out to us about this shooting was Decoy Boy, right? We're all on social media. We all watch the news. We have all, whether we wanted to or not, witnessed, thanks to social media and the news, a lot of shootings. A lot of shootings, whether it's gang-related or otherwise. And I have to say, I don't know if I'm the only one. Never in my entire life have I seen a situation when a shooting happens and then somebody completely unrelated to the shooting that just happened jumps up and down and says that they did it and gets arrested ^t-00-02-06

Why would you do that? Why would you obstruct justice in this manner? And now in addition to those charges, we learn that he's been harboring images of child abuse, okay? He has kiddie porn.

He was also, when the police had approached him, he was being weird about giving them his cell phone, okay? So they took him into custody. They treated him for a medical condition. And then they start asking this guy questions about, you know, what are you doing? Can we see your cell phone? And he's being really cagey about giving over his cell phone. They're like, okay, we're trying to get to the bottom of why you would stand up and scream, "Shoot me, shoot me," immediately following the aftermath of this shooting, okay? ^t-00-04-14

He has images of kiddie porn. There's no other way to say this: related to child abuse on his cell phone. Now, what does that tell you about this guy? What does it tell you about <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-04-51"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span>? What that signals to me about <a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a> is that I've read a lot about <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-04-51"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span>.

So this guy who is into this sort of thing... We also figure out that in the past, he has given interviews related to <span id="ent-date-september-11th-t-00-05-31"><a href="/entities/date-september-11th.md">September 11th</a></span> and Al Qaeda. He is in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-05-31"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> and he is obstructing justice. And he also happens to have this totally disgusting addiction of some description. I'm assuming it's an addiction, and that's what he's harboring. He's harboring child abuse images on his phone. That's what I'm gonna tell you. That's my instinct immediately. I don't like this guy. That is suspect, okay?<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-suspect-climbs-onto-uvu-roof-before-charlie-kirk-s-t-00-05-31"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-suspect-climbs-onto-uvu-roof-before-charlie-kirk-s.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-05-31

Now, in terms of this indictment, now that we can formally read the indictment, there's been a lot that's been said that I think a lot of the miscommunication is perhaps coming from <span id="ent-person-governor-cox-t-00-06-16"><a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a></span>. I think he, in and of himself, I probably should look into <a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a>. I'm not sure why he said some things that are apparently untrue. Maybe he misspoke. I understand there is a lot of pressure when it comes to this investigation. But let's just take us through this indictment. I think it's important for us to go through it so that we can see the setup here of what took place on <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-06-16"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>.<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve-t-00-06-16"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> Now, first, they provide basically an overview in this indictment.

I don't know why they keep signaling that to us. On September 11, <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-06-59"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span>, when <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-06-59"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span> James <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> surrendered to police at <span id="ent-org-washington-county-sheriff-s-office-t-00-06-59"><a href="/entities/org-washington-county-sheriff-s-office.md">Washington County Sheriff's Office</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-11-tyler-robinson-surrenders-to-police-for--t-00-06-59"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-tyler-robinson-surrenders-to-police-for-.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-11-tyler-james-robinson-surrenders-to-polic-t-00-06-59"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-tyler-james-robinson-surrenders-to-polic.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>... That was when it happened. They found DNA consistent with <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> on the rifle trigger. After shooting Mr. Kirk, <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> hid the gun. They're going to get into that. Discarded the clothing that he was wearing when he fired the rifle, and he told his lover slash roommate to delete incriminating text messages and not to speak with police, and also they will be charging him count six because children were present at the time of the shooting. Okay. ^t-00-06-59

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-q7f8r-THr84/t-00-07-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7f8r-THr84&t=459" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, to get through this, we are told that the suspect after this shooting took place, that there was a police officer who immediately looked upward and realized he had heard the sign of a rifle, knew that it was obviously coming from the rooftops. They then began crawling through the footage, began crawling through the footage to see what had happened. They tell us that this discovery led to an intensive review. Let me go actually back up to this paragraph. ^t-00-07-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-q7f8r-THr84/t-00-08-07.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:07</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7f8r-THr84&t=487" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Police reviewed surveillance from the camera that was covering the roof and discovered that it recorded an individual that was dressed in dark clothing who had crossed the railing from the public walkway and dropped onto the roof at approximately 12:15 p.m. Now, just to very quickly, I'm going to just tell you, according to our timeline, we know that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-07"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> gets shot at 12:23 p.m., so they're now telling us that he was on that roof since 12:15 p.m., so he's setting up that shot, we can assume, for about eight minutes, okay? ^t-00-08-07

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-q7f8r-THr84/t-00-08-44.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:44</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7f8r-THr84&t=524" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It goes on, although the individual moved out of the camera's view for a short time, the camera again captured the individual running across the roof and then low-crawling to the area that the officer had recognized as where the suspected sniper had dropped into a prone shooting position. After a short time, which matches the known time of the shot, the individual arose and then ran across the roof to the northeast. So nothing in here implies that he had, you know, taken apart the shotgun—I mean, that just seems to be now removed from the narrative altogether. It goes on to read that this discovery led to an intensive review of <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-08-44"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> surveillance recordings to attempt to track and identify the suspect. ^t-00-08-44

He is wearing a black shirt with an American flag in its center, a dark baseball cap, large sunglasses. Throughout the surveillance, the suspect keeps his head down and rarely raises his head enough to get a clear image of his face. As he proceeds across the campus, he is seen walking with an unusual gait. The suspect walks with very little bending in his right leg, consistent with a rifle being hidden in his pants. This unusual gait continues until the suspect is seen crossing the railing off the open walkway and onto the roof where he leaves the camera's view. ^t-00-09-27

It looks to me like both his legs were bending. I don't see why they don't just release— why don't they just release this fully so we can make sure that this is the same person that we see walking across with a limp, right, that footage which was provided by TMZ? Also, you will notice that nowhere in this indictment as we go on are they going to mention what <span id="ent-person-governor-cox-t-00-10-09"><a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a></span> spoke about. Like, first, he came in a different outfit. Remember, <a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a> said he was wearing the light shorts and maroon shirt.

This is missing from the indictment and I'm wondering why. What is the explanation for that? That would be a part of it if you were scouting the shooting. Now they're just like, let's jump into the guy that is wearing black and we're not going to give you footage. We're going to tell you that this is him and you can assume that he slowly walked up this staircase and was obscuring his face from view. Okay. Then it tells us that a camera later captures the suspect as he runs across the roof, gets into the shooting position, and then immediately after the shot was fired, we know that he runs across carrying an item whose shape is consistent with a rifle. The suspect is then seen climbing down the roof. ^t-00-10-54

He then picks up the item and runs toward the northeast end of the campus. It tells us that's how they then expand their crime scene investigation. They followed his escape path to the northeast end of the campus where they believe the suspect left campus and entered a wooded area. In that wooded area, investigators found a bolt action rifle wrapped in a towel. So again, there was no disassembly. It's wrapped in a towel; presumably that's how he covered it while he was running. The rifle contained one spent round and three unspent rounds. This is consistent with the facts officers observed at the time of and immediately after the shooting. ^t-00-11-34

I find that to be unacceptable. Okay? Unacceptable. I want every single text message. I want timestamps.

I'm gonna pull this up because I took notes regarding <a href="/entities/person-lance-twiggs.md">Lance</a>, because I wanna know everything, okay? <a href="/entities/person-lance-twiggs.md">Lance</a>, they told us, went to live with his relatives, so no longer in the house with his mother and father.

But again, he went to live with relatives and he has issues. They say that he allegedly has a lot of issues with drinking. That Christmas, approximately three years ago, he almost overdosed. He drank a bottle of vodka. They are telling me that they were there. They were present for this, and fear began to spread about whether or not even the family would be able to take care of him because of issues that he was having.

And at this point, they felt that he could not be around children, that they felt that he had become increasingly more radical, increasingly more dangerous, and just sort of off the rails. They said that they're unhappy that the media is presenting him in this manner, like he's just this kind of, like, soft, soft guy or like, you know, a person that was just transitioning.

And this individual family member said to me, yup, we are hearing the exact same thing, that they would prod that narrative further. But there was some unusual traffic, a lot of cars that were seen outside leading up to the shooting, in the days before the shooting or the week before the shooting. I'll straighten out that timeline for you and get real specific because I will pin down when exactly this was happening. But leading up to the shooting there was unusual traffic in the driveway where <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-33-29"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> and <span id="ent-person-lance-twiggs-t-00-33-29"><a href="/entities/person-lance-twiggs.md">Lance</a></span> lived.

And so other people are saying that that is something that struck them as odd. There was unusual traffic at this house in the weeks leading up to this shooting. And again, I will perfect that timeline of exactly why—I have gone out to people for evidence of that. But there were apparently lots of different license plates, and it therefore caused a little neighborhood kerfuffle because other people were not able to park their cars because there were so many people that were at this house, unusual traffic again.

And I have to tell you, I find it very irritating. Because I do feel like some of us have earned the right to have some credibility on the subject of <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a> and don't want to be called those names when we have some mild pushback on some of the overreaches, whether it's you know, whether they're winning or losing the propaganda war right now—and my contention is they've begun to lose it. ^t-00-51-13

And also with respect to you, and I speculated about this at the <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-51-57"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> event, whether the possibility of <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-51-57"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span> possibly being a <span id="ent-org-mossad-t-00-51-57"><a href="/entities/org-mossad.md">Mossad</a></span> agent or asset or affiliated with—that's been turned around on <span id="ent-concept-me-too-t-00-51-57"><a href="/entities/concept-me-too.md">me too</a></span>, to you must be anti-Semitic.

Well, there's good news. They've created the smart equity loan, which is a solution that is designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike an HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the smart equity loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment, giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call <a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a> and start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210 or visit americanfinancing.net/Owens, americanfinancing.net/Owens. ^t-01-08-59

Lucy Marion and Bayan writes, "Love you, <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>, from <span id="ent-gpe-saudi-arabia-t-01-15-59"><a href="/entities/gpe-saudi-arabia.md">Saudi Arabia</a></span>. Thank you. You are my spirit animal. God bless you and keep you safe and your family. Thank you for being the source of sanity. You are absolutely right. It is good versus evil." And I also want to say there are more of us than them. That was a <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-01-15-59"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Kirk</a></span> thing. He said to me, what is the one thing that every slave, that every slave civilization has had since the beginning of mankind and what they have in common, pardon? ^t-01-15-59

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-q7f8r-THr84/t-01-16-35.md" class="timestamp-link">01:16:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7f8r-THr84&t=4595" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And the answer is that there was always more slaves than masters, which is something to consider. There is more of us than there are of them. And I think that's why they're in a panic, because we're waking up. We'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll see you guys tomorrow. ^t-01-16-35
