Happy Thursday. Last show until I take a much-needed break. And it's gonna be a good one. As always, as we continue this investigation, we are definitively getting closer. So what do we recall? Well, we were told that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) just had healthy bones. That it was a miracle that the gun did not take his neck out and that his spine somehow stopped it. I can now officially debunk that Marvel storyline and therefore refocus our investigation on what actually happened on 9/10 because I have new information, and I'm presenting it to the public today. Plus, later on the show, Josh Hammer has emerged. You know, he's the one that thinks that all white men, all white European men, are anti-Semitic. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=45" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-00-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Well, he is now releasing text messages between him and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) that literally prove absolutely nothing other than that Josh Hammer is a dummy and didn't realize that the text messages make his storyline somehow even less credible. Good news is that he at least didn't plug his book. Welcome back to Candace. All right, you guys, where to begin? Obviously, we have a lot to unpack before I go on vacation. I'm looking forward to reading. ^t-00-00-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=87" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-01-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I'm also looking forward to processing a lot of the information that is coming to me and researching more. The place that we should start on today's show is with, well, I first and foremost have to tell you right at the top, I can't tell you exactly who the information came from or which parties were involved in giving me this information because I don't want to get anybody in trouble. But I can say that I have positively verified something about the injury that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) sustained to his neck that I think is going to go a very long way in terms of helping those of us who have been sleuthing, those of us who want answers, those of us who are dedicating our time to this, because what we are being told by the authorities beggars belief, as John and Irina Maplin said. It just simply beggars belief. ^t-00-01-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=131" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-02-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We also want to make sure that we are presenting evidence and debunking one another where we can, so that all of us can collectively zero in and build upon whatever facts we have in this decentralized investigation. This is about the injury, okay? So Andrew Colvett was, I can tell you, telling the truth in part when he wrote that very long tweet in which he tried to explain why there was no exit wound. Do you recall this? Long story short, he said, "I'm going to read it. I want to address some of the things about the lack of an exit wound with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-02-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=169" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-02-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I'm usually not interested in delving into most of this kind of online chatter, and I apologize if this is somewhat graphic, but in this case, the fact that there wasn't an exit wound is probably another miracle, and I want people to know. I just spoke with the surgeon who worked on Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in the hospital. He said the bullet absolutely should have gone through, which is very normal for a high-powered, high-velocity round. I've seen wounds from this caliber many times, and they always just go through everything. This would have taken a moose or two down, an elk, et cetera, but it didn't go through. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) body stopped it. I mentioned to his doctor that there were dozens of staff, students, and special guests standing directly behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on the other side of the tent. And he replied, 'It was an absolute miracle that someone else didn't get killed.' ^t-00-02-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=211" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-03-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** His bone was so healthy, and the density was so, so impressive that he's like the Man of Steel. It should have just gone through and through. It likely would have killed those standing behind him too. In the end, the coroner did find the bullet just beneath the skin. Even in death, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) managed to save the lives of those around him. Remarkable. Miraculous. Now, keep that up for just a second because it's really around here. His bone was so healthy, and the density was so, so impressive that he's like the Man of Steel. That we just went, mm, something's not right. I'm not right. A lot of stuff is not right. I just don't know why a surgeon would be saying something that actually only the medical examiner, somebody that specializes in forensics, could really contribute. ^t-00-03-31

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=254" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-04-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Yes, a surgeon can tell you—or actually any person with common sense can tell you—that your bone density is better when you're younger, but this seemed a little bit too performative. Now, I can tell you... The part that he is telling the truth about is that Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) neck indeed did stop the bullet, without question, okay? And this is going to dispel a lot of theories that are out there. And I'm telling you this 100%. Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was shot from the front, and the bullet did not exit. And at least a fragment of the bullet was recovered from his neck. And I'm going to tell you exactly where it was recovered from. I have fact-checked this information from multiple sources now. ^t-00-04-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=299" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-04-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I've actually been sitting on this for a little bit over a week, right around here. So think about almost in line with your shoulder blade, right in the center. Now, why is that helpful? Because it gives us a bullet trajectory, okay? Went in here where you saw that, and it was stopped, and a fragment was pulled from—think right, if you're just touching your spine in line with your shoulder blade. That leads us obviously to the part that he's maybe not being forthcoming about. They did not recover a bullet from a .30-06. They didn't recover a bullet from a .30-06. This didn't happen, okay? ^t-00-04-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=341" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-05-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** If they had found a .30-06 bullet, Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) death certificate certainly would have reflected that. In suicide situations—that's just one example; medical examiners, feel free to chime in— I've spoken to quite a few, but when the gun and the bullet are known, they are reflected onto the death certificate, okay? There is not one reflected onto Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) death certificate because they did not recover a bullet from a .30-06. Hunters and military men, rejoice. It turns out that common sense still rules the roost, okay? You guys were right. You were absolutely right. And this is why I hate politics because it requires us to submit to the idea ^t-00-05-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=385" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-06-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** that we were all somehow born yesterday, that it really can just—life really can just be a Marvel comic with people that are, I guess, a DC comic where there are men of steel that are able, because they're young, to stop 3,000 pounds of energy that is coming at them. That didn't happen. So where does that leave us, guys? ^t-00-06-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=408" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-06-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Well, the part that is now extraordinarily suspicious is that Andrew has claimed that he had a conversation with the surgeon who offered up the idea that it really was just your modern Christian miracle, that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was just young and his bones had a lot of density, which made him stronger somehow than a Cape buffalo. Enough pushups and asparagus, and you too can stop 3,000 pounds of energy coming at you. What are we to make of that? What are we to make of the fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not do that, actually? It means that he was shot with a completely different kind of gun, obviously, okay? The kind where this would make sense, ^t-00-06-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=452" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-07-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** that it didn't cut through him, the kind where it would make sense that outside of an artery effectively exploding from the front, there was—you know—his neck didn't explode, which that particular weapon that they were trying to tell us Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was killed with would have gone through about seven necks, okay? You will recall that throughout all of this—or during this mayhem, rather—there were people who were insisting, by the way, they were on the ground, the witnesses that were insisting that they heard multiple shots. That's another element of this. But those individuals were not the ones that were awarded with mainstream media interviews. ^t-00-07-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=494" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-08-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** In fact, one guy—and this kind of went viral at the time—even got pushed, physically pushed, and was not given the ability to speak at all. They shut him up. If we were just examining the situation, it certainly looked like Turning Point employees or staff or students thugged him so that he wouldn't say what he thought happened. Let's take a listen to that clip that has gone viral. (Clip: Eyewitness) ^t-00-08-14

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=524" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-08-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** I was standing from probably the third row in the bottom. I heard the shot ring out. I looked to my left, and then I looked over to my right. I saw him slump over in his chair forward. He slumped over. He had blood coming from the left side of his neck down his shirt, and he slumped over, and he was carried off. Get off me! Get off me! Emotions are running high right now. ^t-00-08-44

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=555" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-09-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Certainly, emotions were running high. He was just trying to speak and to say what he saw. And interestingly though, if you think through what he said there, he said, "I was in the third row," right? And a shot rang out, and I looked to my left, and I looked to my right. Now we're not specific on where exactly he was standing, but if a shot—a high-powered rifle—came from 250 yards behind you, you'd probably look back first, right? Like, common sense: if you heard the sound coming from behind you, you would look back, probably even before your brain came online. Your instinct would be to duck into... make sure that you're not going to get hit by something that's coming from behind you. Now, to clarify immediately here and to again debunk some other internet conspiracy theories: ^t-00-09-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=601" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-10-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That is not Andrew Colvett in that video. A lot of people were like, "Is this Andrew Colvett from Turning Point USA hiding under a hat?" It is not true. I spoke to Andrew on this actual day. He definitively flew in to Utah after the shooting took place. He was not therefore on the ground. But the person that is in that video—as soon as I just put up a picture and I said, "I'd like to identify this person"— his friend first left a nasty comment, like, "Why are you trying to look out for this guy?" "He did the right thing." "How dare we ask questions?" Like, how dare we try to get testimony from anybody else that day? Kind of then messages me privately because I reached out, and I'm like, "I'm just trying to confirm the story." And I reached out, and he says to me—well, and I'm paraphrasing here—he doesn't want to speak to you. ^t-00-10-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=645" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-10-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He doesn't want to speak to media because he's been instructed not to speak to media because he's gotten the Turning Point chapter into trouble before for speaking out in the media. And he just doesn't want to do that. And I said, "That seems very strange to me." "What are you—what are you saying to me?" You have a TPUSA person who can't speak out about things. There were tons of people that were talking about their testimonies. It's very odd. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, you're telling me that Turning Point USA sent around a text and said, "Nobody speak to the media"? That was his excuse, by the way, for why he shut that guy up. People were saying, "Oh, you know, they're not allowed to speak to the media." So they were just doing what they were told. ^t-00-10-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=688" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-11-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Well, then it's kind of interesting. You should know, but I then determined that the person doing the shoving is first and foremost not a Turning Point USA employee. He is beyond that not a student at UVU. He is not a Turning Point USA student therefore either. He was actually brought in as a volunteer, which I found to be quite strange. Like, look, I've done a lot of campus stops, and typically it's the chapter of that school that does everything. It's the chapter that handles everything. ^t-00-11-28

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=724" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-12-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, bigger events, they certainly work with other organizations, and it's possible, I guess. It registered to me as odd that a volunteer would have the courage to shut down a kid that's speaking in that way, in that aggressive manner. I would imagine Turning Point would tell their volunteers not to get physical with students on campus. But what do I know? I just have common sense. Now, how do I know that he is not a Turning Point USA employee and he is not a UVU or Turning Point USA student? Well, because despite him stopping a college kid from speaking about what he heard, ^t-00-12-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=764" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-12-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** that young man—whose name is Cooper—and I'm very comfortable telling you this because, well, he went on Fox News that very night to provide eyewitness testimony to exactly what he heard and what he saw because apparently he was the person that was holding the mic when the shot rang out. Take a listen to what he told Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters) on the night of. (Clip: Cooper Brown) ^t-00-12-44

Cooper, what happened? Yeah, so this requires a little bit of background knowledge. So I work for an organization called Leadership Institute. And what we do is we work hand-in-hand with all the different conservative coalition groups on college campuses: the Young Americans for Liberty, the Students for Life, and the Turning Point USAs. And so at Utah Valley, we had been really, really excited to be able to host Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) this semester. ^t-00-13-06

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=825" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-13-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** And we had spent weeks and weeks and weeks getting volunteers, advertising for this event, and just so excited to be able to host Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) at this university. And then unfortunately, it had to end in absolute tragedy. ^t-00-13-45

I don't know how this works. But the next day, sure enough, he appeared on Fox News again. ^t-00-14-05

(Clip: Cooper Brown) That day we had 30 or so student volunteers that were designated roles that were going to be helping pass out Turning Point USA merchandise and getting people signed up for the event. And my responsibility was when the event actually started to help manage just the microphone. So something simple as just raising it and lowering it, making sure students were able to speak into it clearly. And I thought this was a fantastic opportunity to be up really, really close, to be able to witness all the amazing dialogue that was going to be happening on campus. ^t-00-14-31

I'm going to start asking questions because I need to know everything. Everything's got to fit neatly into my timeline. So in trying to reach out to him and in publicly posting, "Hey, I'm trying to identify this individual," I received a ton of emails. One email said, "Hey, I'm actually..." his cousin, "and here is his number." Now I noticed that that cousin happens to live in Phoenix, Arizona, so I went and just checked some profiles on social media. I found some Browns, but they were all living in Phoenix, Arizona. Okay, maybe this person's from Phoenix, Arizona. ^t-00-15-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=957" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-15-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Well, actually, when I went through what he has as his resume on this website where he says that he works with this institute, I could in fact check any of the things. Went to school—a minor, a very small college in New Hampshire. I'm from the Northeast. If you're going to school in New Hampshire—especially not the University of New Hampshire—you can go ahead and bet that you're going to be a local. So I'm looking for a kid that's from New Hampshire to go to this tiny school. I found someone from that name with his name, but it was actually a girl that had that name and graduated in the year that he says he graduated in. He doesn't look to me like he just graduated college, but according to his resume, he did. ^t-00-15-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=999" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-16-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And the number that she gives me—which is the first thing that registers to me as odd—is it's a Utah. I mean, sorry, it's a Phoenix-based number. So I'm going, who is this person? And why is it linking that number to somebody else who is 32 years old and has that same last name? I don't know. I intend to get those answers, but there's something here that strikes me as a little bit odd, especially given the fact that as a volunteer—as he expresses there—they decided to allow him to hold the microphone. That's supposed to be like kind of an honor at Utah events. Turning Point USA kids work really hard to put these events on. They decide who's gonna hold the microphone. They went with a volunteer. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out, okay? ^t-00-16-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=1042" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-17-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I don't know, but I'm going to find out, so... If you went to Southern New Hampshire University with this Cooper Brown and you majored with him in politics and you can provide some insight, I'd like to hear from you. I am again asking these questions publicly because we are getting no answers from Turning Point USA or the feds or anything that makes any practical sense in this scenario. Why was everything so brand new on this day? Now, for those of you that are still caught up in what I just told you, which is that for a fact, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot from the front. So we know the bullet's trajectory. There's no games here. There's no magic bullets. It's a smaller weapon, okay? Your ears didn't betray you. ^t-00-17-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=1087" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-18-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** My ears didn't betray me. We definitely did hear a very recognizable sound of a rifle shot. But I'm telling you that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wasn't hit with that rifle. And there is not a medical examiner's report or a death certificate which we'll stipulate otherwise. It doesn't exist. So what exactly are the feds building their case on? Vibes or sheer corruption? Because I'm thinking it might be the latter. And who would be the person that can make that fit? Look, I did receive a tip. And guess what? There was another person in this never-ending brand-new cast of characters that was also involved in this story. And this person in an email ^t-00-18-07

That's the medical examiner. It is a woman named Dr. Deidre Weiss Amaro. Deidre Weiss Amaro is her name, and she blew in from California. She was announced as the new state medical examiner in May of 2024. I'm sorry, from Missouri. I think she also worked at some point in California, and she was announced as the new Utah medical examiner, state Utah medical examiner, in May of 2024. So I'm interested in learning as much as I can about this medical examiner. I'd like to know more about this medical examiner. ^t-00-18-51

Now, it is possible, given what we know about Fed-type operations and what we know about the JFK shooting—which we are still not allowed to tell the truth about, but we all know what the truth is— that there are often decoys, even decoy sounds; that it is totally plausible that there were multiple people there that day who found out maybe even in the final hour—which one of them is going to take the shot, right? ^t-00-19-31

And I will say that that is now my well-informed opinion—well-informed opinion—that we are looking for a person that was a lot closer to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and likely in the audience. And that goes a long way, by the way, in terms of trying to explain why they're maybe hiding the footage from behind Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) head. Maybe that is the reason that that footage was so crucial first and foremost. ^t-00-20-09

The person who took the cameras down was absolutely not instructed to do so by law enforcement. He just wasn't, okay? So why say that? Also, why grab the one behind his head first? Of all the cameras, why that one first and foremost? And when I actually think about the clip that I was shown, it was more to the right. ^t-00-20-54

By the way, despite the fact that we had this amazing cast of characters—all these Caldera Engineering-connected people who made it to the mainstream media to talk about what they heard—there was actually one eyewitness there who could not be shoved out of the way and was able to make his way onto Fox News immediately after to provide a description of ^t-00-21-29

Jason Chavitz (Jason Chavitz) is a former politician and a Fox News contributor who was a witness to this event because he is from Utah. He attended this event. He apparently was in communication with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ahead of the event. And I have to say that if everyone that day—he's maybe one of the few people that I would say on the mainstream media that seemed genuinely shaken by the event. He went live, was speaking through what he saw, what he heard, what he was expecting. And he was rebutting—because he was on a couple of shows—rebutting the idea that the shot was from far away.

The venue is such that there's a four-story building, which is the administrative building to the south. The other buildings around the site are not quite so high, but you could be on the second level and watch Charlie (Charlie Kirk). The police had moved the people. There were some people that were above Charlie (Charlie Kirk), so that awning that you're seeing there— there's a place to be there—but the police moved people out to the sides.

And then elsewhere, when he's on Fox News and people are saying the shot was from like the Losey building, he doesn't believe that. He doesn't believe that. By the way, Jason Chavitz (Jason Chavitz), he's been honest about his background. His parents are in the government. They're literally in the FBI. So he's telling you that shot was closer. So what gives? Also, why is everybody telling lies? I want to be very clear. It's possible that the people at Turning Point are simply terrified. That's definitely a possibility here. They are very much aware of what these people are capable of. And maybe they're just trying to get by, and they're being told what to say and what to do. And they want to keep the peace. ^t-00-24-13

I think that accidentally—I accidentally ruined the Fed narrative. I think the plan was to never allow the back footage of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to see the light of day. Never was allowed to see the light of day. That way, they were going to say that they recovered a .30-06 bullet. Right? Instilling? We covered a .30-06 bullet. They were—maybe when they were digging stuff up—and there it was, and it went through. We wouldn't have known; we would have been none the wiser, right? No one else is telling us anything or showing us anything. And I think they were going to say—or the other option—like it completely took his neck out. We wouldn't have been any wiser. ^t-00-24-57

I think we accidentally ruined what they were going to try to do to frame this. I think they wanted this to be a .30-06 narrative. And now they're gonna have a lot of difficulty getting that through a courtroom. They panicked; they tried to explain it away. They're saying that it's a miracle. I don't think it is. It obviously was not a miracle. I think it is likely ^t-00-25-40

That explains also why, by the way, when I take a look, there's so many adults; there's no UVU kids that were in the mainstream media. Cooper's not even a UVU kid; he's not a TPUSA kid. Why were they not able to find UVU students to say what it is that they heard and what they saw that day?

And he's like, "I know that sounds weird and conspiratorial, but it seems like they were trying to make us believe that this is what we heard." And it's interesting also because remember when Phil Lyman gave us his footage and he walks outside of that building? The two now infamous goth girls were not goth at all, and they're just wearing black. They say that they heard two shots. They never made it to Fox News. They never made it to the mainstream media, but they too also said that they heard two shots. (Clip: Eyewitnesses) Take a listen. ^t-00-27-06

It turns out the Steeles are big with Caldera Engineering. And things aren't adding up with this company, okay? It's just not adding up with this company. And I can tell you, I was receiving information from people who work with valves, who have been in the industry for 30 years, that live nearby. And I have never heard of Caldera Engineering. That's not normal. I've never heard of them. I've never worked with them. I've never received any of their valves. Something's not right here. ^t-00-29-26

Another person gave us a tip and said, "Hey, did you know that there's literally someone who works at Caldera Engineering who is a professional actor?" No background engineering, went to school for theater, worked in theater, was in plays, was involved in plays. I looked through everything, went through it. I'm like, "This doesn't make sense." "Why is he suddenly at Caldera Engineering?" Like not later in life, just like randomly on his resume is Caldera Engineering. ^t-00-30-06

But we don't know if the internet was scraping and got things incorrect, but there was an Israeli individual who was listed as the founder of Caldera Engineering. We obviously know that Caldera Engineering had said that they did projects—going with their website—in Israel. I don't know what projects they worked on.

This particular individual has a very long background in engineering in Israel. Maybe it's because they work together, and that's the internet thought that this person was the founder, and the individual was not. But it's piquing our interest now. We are confused, I would say at best, about this company because we wanted to go back and just determine who the founders were. Well, just our bad luck. The company was established in 1997, so you won't be able to get those formation LLC docs. You can find LLC docs in general. ^t-00-31-34

And in order to get them, you have to go in person somewhere. And I am certain I'm not going to be able to get my hands on that.

You can use a lawyer anywhere, but usually when you're formulating your company... Maybe it was a friend; I don't know. But I now have a ton of questions about Caldera Engineering. So if you have any information—are you able to find anything about them? Or maybe you are an engineer, and you're like, "I've been buying their valves actually for 20 years, actually." "And they're fantastic." "They work great." I'd like to hear from you. ^t-00-32-53

So this plane left from Texas, went over to Utah right about the time that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got assassinated. It dipped real low.

"Somebody decided to take a vacation flight from Texas over Utah to do a little circle and return back home." "It happens all the time." "You know, when you're bored and you just have an unbelievable amount of money, that's what you do." We're not gonna get those answers from Kash Patel (Kash Patel) about that plane. We're not even getting straight answers about the other plane. That's the plane where Derek Maxfield, his wife, Shalane Maxfield—they sold some beauty company for billions, I believe. And they now just run a human sex trafficking organization in Utah. ^t-00-38-41

I can't remember. 888 is what I actually remember. And it seemed as though that plane left. It went to Page, Arizona, and it appeared that the ADS-B transponder turned off. Now, what Kash Patel (Kash Patel) told us is different from what Derek Maxfield told us. Derek Maxfield on Instagram clarified that the Air Traffic Control Center was in agreement with them that they could stop transponding. Kash Patel (Kash Patel) says that plane never stopped transponding. So I don't know what the truth is, and I'm not even pretending that we're ever gonna get the truth. ^t-00-39-25

Obviously multiple pilots, people that work at these airports, people who are invested in this story have reached out, and I'm grateful for that. Multiple people have confirmed that this plane was a little bit weird that day. It was supposed to land in Page, Arizona, in Million Air FBO. Last second, it made a change. As you guys know, an FBO was just a private terminal. So if you're in a public airport, you go to terminal seven. If you're flying private, you go to FBO, and it has a name. ^t-00-40-07

Last second—I mean, and I mean last second—that plane decided to change and say, "We are going to instead land into Signature," a different FBO. Apparently it landed into Signature. That's what we were—that's certainly what we were told. But there's something off about that because when people are trying to look into it, somebody at that FBO at first said, "Oh yes, you've made multiple trips in the last couple of days." And then that person said, "I don't know what you're talking about." "No plane ever landed here." What? Multiple people have confirmed this for me: that there's something very unusual about this flight. ^t-00-40-47

That doesn't make sense to me. I don't like that we've got feds guarding like FBO information. We've got feds guarding Dairy Queens. I don't know. I don't know. Do you need your ice cream guarded? What is going on? Like, guys, you gotta just give up. It's gonna come out. Whatever it is, it's gonna come out. You would have to—and I wouldn't put it past you—you'd have to get rid of all of us. You've got like seven billion people you've got to ethnically cleanse right now if you want us to just forget about the Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) story. No one's forgetting it, okay?

I don't know whose sadistic idea it was to make this a public execution, but let me tell you where you made the mistake, okay? In 1963, when JFK was shot, people didn't watch it on TikTok. People mostly read about it, and then the feds lied about it, and they heard about it. But to be able to have us watch that live around the world, you traumatized all of us—and not in the way that you meant to. You meant to traumatize us and maybe then make us fearful and scared. ^t-00-42-13

Then you made us really angry that corruption is allowed to be like this—just so blatant and so in our face, looking at us as if we're nothing. And what are you going to do about it? That's the attitude. "What are you gonna do about it?" You want to traumatize us and then on a dime flip and look us in the face and go, "How dare you ask questions?" "People are grieving." Yeah, we're grieving because you assassinated Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) in front of the entire world. If you had pretended he slipped and fell on some ice in the winter, maybe you wouldn't have this response. But you got our attention because you went after our attention. ^t-00-42-57

He's an idiot. He really is an idiot. First and foremost, just funny. I should have pulled it up. He also brought up his book. He issued a statement about the retreat weekend. Josh Hammer just lies through his teeth all the time. And so he was releasing a statement about how wonderful the Hamptons retreat was and that him and Seth Dillon totally did not press Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on anything. And in this public statement, he mentioned his book again. He said, like, "I came to the Hamptons because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wanted me to bring signed copies of my book." I mean, wacky. This man—it's always appropriate if you're Josh Hammer to promote your book, which is just amazing. ^t-00-44-21

Great; it lets us know that the call happened at the exact same time that we figured it would actually happen in a timeline that had to have been an evening call before he tweeted "public execution" in this three-hour window. But these are the messages. We should read them. Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk): "Thank you for your help, guys." A totally standard response that you say no matter what. Exclamation point. And then I assume this is Josh Hammer that replies and says, "Good luck at the campus visit start." "Don't hesitate to let me know or any of us know how we can help." "What's your first stop tomorrow, by the way?" ^t-00-45-03

He needed tips on how to—because he just loved Israel so hard that he was like, "Give me the best talking points so I can go out there. I can defend this state." And I know that like a couple hours ago I was really angry, and I said, "I'm done with the pro-Israel lobby," but now I just love you so much that I just—I want to get on the phone with you and have you—who could not beat me in a debate—teach me how to debate. That's what he told us. So we're supposed to believe that he didn't know where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was debating, but that's how that was what the call was about. I don't know. ^t-00-45-45

I don't know anything other than that Josh Hammer is an idiot who can't be trusted and lies through his teeth. I do wanna get to speaking on the topic of Israel. There was a very good video that came out. Actually, let's first talk about the Israel-Hamas peace deal that they're trying to shut down our throats. Now, if you're reading the headlines, a peace agreement—is what we're calling it—has been reached between Israel and Hamas. ^t-00-46-21

And this is, of course, after everything that happened on October 7th. Don't forget about October 7th. And yeah, like hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are missing. And yeah, they have destroyed 85% of Gaza. And they're going to try to tell us that we've reached peace. At the center of it was Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner (Jared Kushner). ^t-00-46-58

Trump (Donald Trump) put a statement out on Truth Social: "Hero, I'm very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our peace plan." "This means that all the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their troops to an agreed-upon line as the first steps towards a strong, durable, and everlasting peace that all parties will be treated fairly." I can't even finish it because it makes me sick that they think we're this dumb. 85% of Gaza has been destroyed in this pre-planned controlled demolition of Gaza. ^t-00-47-32

Jared Kushner (Jared Kushner) is involved in—he will financially benefit from whatever they build in its place. Again, all of this began before October 7th, right? So we are supposed to believe that this isn't just—well—business as usual. We got done; we need to get done, and now we can begin phase two. But we're supposed to thank them. We're supposed to thank the monsters that did this. You guys have it in your heart to say thank you?

Maybe, but I'm not sure there's much left of Gaza at this point. So if you think about even the construct—like Gaza—Gaza was not really a historical precedent, right? It was the result of a war, right? You had tribes that were in different places, but then Gaza became a thing. Egypt used to run it. And then over time, you had different governments that came in different ways. So you have another war. Usually when wars happen, borders are changed historically over time. ^t-00-49-14

I think that both sides are spending a fortune on military. I think neither side really wants to have a terrorist organization enclave right between them. And Gaza's waterfront property—it could be very valuable if people would focus on kind of building up livelihoods. You think about all the money that's gone into this tunnel network and into all the munitions—if that would have gone into education or innovation—what could have been done? And so I think that it's a little bit of an unfortunate situation there, but I think from Israel's perspective, I would do my best to move the people out and then clean it up. But I don't think that Israel has stated that they don't want the people to move back there afterwards. ^t-00-49-53

So let me say this. This is our never again, okay? This is a Holocaust. A Holocaust just happened—a real Holocaust just happened. We will never forget this. You need to tell your children what happened in Gaza. You need to tell them exactly who did it, exactly whose families were involved in this. And when you hear in the future somebody tell you like, "We're going to Gaza beach for a vacation," you need to look at them like they are the absolute vermin of our society because they are—they are. ^t-00-50-41

I came across a clip of Matt Walsh to Vivek—wait, Dore? It's very funny. And he was saying about the Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) messages; he actually thought they were fake because he said he couldn't believe the sentence that felt too on the nose. He's like, "I genuinely thought that there's no way Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would ever leave the pro-Israel lobby—first and foremost, his support for Israel." "He loved it so much." ^t-00-52-05

"I have no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause." And anyways, he gave some very sage advice—which is not going to be heeded by the Josh Hammers of the world—about what that really means: that your behavior pushed even Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) away.

What do you mean we're trusting the feds? Like since when are we doing that? Mary Go Wrong writes—that's very funny. Mary Go Wrong. "Keep speaking the truth, Candace (Candace Owens)." Thank you so much. Julie G. writes, "I've been spending a couple of hours a day defending you on X, and I'm truly honored to have done so." "You've gone a little quieter over the last few days." "The special bond that you shared with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is evident for all to see in many videos of you both." "Truth will prevail." ^t-00-58-17

Also, don't waste your time. In case you don't know, there's like military bot farms on X, which sucks, but that is reality. And so you're not even fighting with real people, so they—they dominate on X. Not so much on Facebook. There's a bit more real people. On Instagram, there's more real people, but they do have bot farms there too. Radical Rat writes—thank you very much for that donation. "High American Muslim fan here. In the spirit of friendship between our faiths, here is an excerpt from the Quran about Jesus, who's speaking as a baby to defend Mary's honor." Said, "I am the servant of God. He has given me the scripture and made me a prophet, and he has made me blessed wherever I am. God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship him." ^t-00-58-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3pxRyNFZk&t=3567" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:59:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-pc3pxRyNFZk/t-00-59-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I think all of us are realizing the tremendous need for true faith right now, and I had sort of tweeted a couple of days ago that you can sense a chink in the armor of deception. Like we're learning a lot about how a lot of money has been put behind these Judeo-Christian programs, which was something that I would speak about with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) because he was, in fact, very interested in Catholicism. And so it is interesting to see that. I do think the evangelical community is feeling that. And let me know if you agree that people are starting to wonder like, "Why does my pastor"—and again, it's not every pastor, but it's too many pastors—"get up on a stage and preach about Megyn Kelly (Megyn Kelly) and Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson)?" ^t-00-59-27

And I think in the end, all of this is good. Like the topic of faith being at the forefront of our minds worldwide is good. Eight Sisters writes, "Keep it up, Candace (Candace Owens)." "It's people like you that are the hope for these two little girls in this picture." "God bless you and keep you safe, praying for you and your team with love from East Texas." Thank you so much. Eight Birds writes, "The more I listen to Candace Owens (Candace Owens), the more I want her to be crazy." "And the more that people tell me she's crazy, the more I want to listen to her." Thank you so much. And our government is crazy. And the rest of us are obviously understanding that and are therefore being called crazy. About the history of Sigmund Freud, the book in my book club. If you can't join the book club, that's fine. ^t-01-00-11

They have been doing this for a very long time. "Candace (Candace Owens), it came from behind." "You haven't been investigating on Elon's platform enough." I can tell you definitively—definitively, definitively, definitively—that Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) shot did not come from behind. I can just take that or leave that. You can still go down that narrative. You can think that you saw that. I'm not saying that a shot wasn't fired from behind. I'm not saying that. Like I said, I've given you my theory. ^t-01-00-56

The entry wound is what is on the front. The bullet did not exit. You are looking for a smaller gun altogether, which is how these operations have to work. You've got to have multiple things going on. It's designed to drive you crazy. And that is why I'm trying to focus investigations. And, you know, I hope you guys trust me enough to know that I went through great hoops—multiple—I had to confirm it the right way, and I did not trust the feds. Brennan Gerby writes, "I have watched every episode that you have ever done, even before the DW days." "You are the best friend anyone could ask for." "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is lucky." "Side note: wishing your kids luck when they try to sneak out as teens." "They're not getting anything past you." You have not met my daughter. ^t-01-01-39

That girl had me putting her hair into pigtails the other night because she couldn't go to sleep, and she came downstairs. She said she just wanted to look cute. It's ridiculous reason. It's ridiculous reason. It's not true. It doesn't make any sense. Nothing she said made sense. And there I was putting her hair into pigtails at nine o'clock p.m., well past her bedtime, because she just wanted to look cute. So toddlers have a way of avoiding bedtime. And it's expert. It is expert level. Born Free writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), I have been a fan since 2018." "Finally got my wife on board last year." "She's now in your book club and a loyal fan, and we never miss an episode." "We love you so much, crisis queen." Tell her thank you. We're definitely a bit wild in the book club. ^t-01-02-24

We go there, for sure. But it's fun; it's very chill, and you know that people are ready because they've read the book, so you're kind of able to push a little bit faster, I would say, on getting people to recognize just how evil things can get. And that's why I say read The Assault on Truth, confront that, and then everything will start to make sense. Because then you're going to go, "How the hell have our public school systems across the world been telling us that Sigmund Freud was like a wonderful man?" Like insane. Brittany Schofield, lastly. She writes, "I'm a stay-at-home mom, and I homeschool our six children." "I am so glad to see that you started homeschooling your children." "We don't live a fancy lifestyle." "My husband has to work his butt off, but it is so worth it." ^t-01-03-09

And by the time—you know—by the time your kid gets through obviously the school system and through college, you go, "What happened?" And what happened is that we gave up our blessed resource. We just gave it to the system. It's so wrong. And I gotta tell you, it's working. ^t-01-03-51

That's amazing. I mean, not amazing trying to pass laws, but it's amazing that they're feeling the pressure, which I will speak about more obviously in the weeks to come and exactly what we're doing and how we're doing it. We're still figuring this thing out. But every day is a new adventure, and I hope that I inspire people to take the step. You will figure it out. Human beings are adaptable, and I can tell you it is way more rewarding. Anyways, you guys, I am going on vacation. Love you. Send me tips if you have them about the topics that we discussed today. Tips@CandaceOwens.com or moretips@CandaceOwens.com. I will obviously be lurking. ^t-01-04-36

As I said, this investigation is ongoing, and I expect that when we get back I'm going to have even more explosive revelations for you. We are absolutely doing this for Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). We will not forget, okay? 9/10. We are not going to forget 9/10, least of all when it hasn't been solved. So if you'd like to support us, obviously you can join our decentralized intelligence agency. It is truly because people around the world are sensing how evil this was and how corrupt it is that they are joining in and giving information where they can. We will always protect you.
