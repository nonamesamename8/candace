There is a lot happening right now, okay? Benjamin Netanyahu is again denying that he murdered Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) despite the fact that no one that I know accused him of doing such a thing. Is that normal for a state leader of a foreign country to have to twice deny that on national television? We also have Bill Ackman who is sending his press hounds on me. There's no other way to say it. He's also dropping text messages that prove nothing. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(33); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:00:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-00-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And a guy named Eric Bolling is just lying through his teeth on PBD, the PBD podcast, to establish this narrative which, for some reason, every major publication is now running with: that I haven't spoken to Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) in years. That is all happening right now, not because I'm lying, but because we are choosing to stay focused on solving the murder of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). And what we are uncovering is much darker than I think any of us could have possibly imagined. So welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-33

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(80); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:01:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-01-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We are pulling all of this together and I'm going, I don't even know where to begin. And I guess we should just start with one of many explosive discoveries, thanks to all of you guys, by the way: anonymous sources invested in the story, wanting to get to the truth, having that gut instinct that something is not right. So we've been wondering. Yesterday, I was also doing a set, an Instagram series of pulling everybody into what doesn't make sense about the changing of the clothes. That Tyler Robinson allegedly did. And we've been wondering why it seems the feds were only willing to release a grainy image of Tyler Robinson from the day of the shooting, despite the tech stack that UVU campus has, right? ^t-00-01-20

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(125); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:02:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-02-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** There's no images that we can see that have been released of his Dodge Challenger that's supposed to be idling nearby the campus for a very long time, right? As he texted these Fed messages, him and Lance are texting and he's telling him every second, minute by minute, what he's done and he mentions that the cops have done a sweep, remember? Tyler is supposed to be babysitting the gun in that moment, waiting for the right moment to go back and, quote-unquote, retrieve his weapon. But he sees a, and I'm not kidding, quote-unquote, squad car. That's what he writes, right? ^t-00-02-05

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(165); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:02:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-02-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He writes, I can get close to it, but there is a squad car parked right by it. Squad car. Okay, yeah, no. How many times do you call a police car a squad car? Do you want to know who calls it a squad car? Someone on the squad. Well, that's how that works. Yeah, but that's what Tyler writes: squad car. Elsewhere in this correspondence, and by the way, thanks to one of you people who commented on yesterday's episode and pointed this out to me. But elsewhere, Tyler says something that only a woman would say. That's why it didn't flag me as weird when I was reading this, it didn't flag me as odd. He says to Lance, allegedly, quote, I worry about prints. ^t-00-02-45

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(206); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:03:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-03-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I had to leave it, referring to the rifle, in a bush where I changed outfits. Wait, changed outfits. Somebody commented, men don't say outfits. That's a woman thing. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's true. I would say I changed my outfit. A man does not say, you just say you changed clothes. You would not say an outfit. Outfit is very girly. Okay, so is this AI or is this a female Fed that put these messages together? We're not feeling like it's Tyler Robinson. That's for sure. Now, another question we ask is: if there is this much available footage, why not, to relieve everybody, to make us feel like this is not a federal operation, why not just release anything to the public? ^t-00-03-26

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(249); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:04:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-04-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Well, the reason is because, according to locals, many of which have emailed me, any of the footage that they had, any footage that they found, they immediately sent over to the feds and the feds told them that they were not allowed to share it at all. Like there was some risk if you shared this at all, it's not going to be good for you. Like they are kind of being pressured by the feds not to share things publicly. And that's why I would say 9-10 is beginning to remind me of 9-11, right? The feds sweep through everything to make sure that they have all of the footage so that no one can question the narrative that they put out. ^t-00-04-09

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(283); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:04:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-04-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It makes me think, you know, how long did it take before they were willing to show us any footage of the alleged giant Boeing plane that hit the Pentagon building? We weren't allowed to see that for a very long time. I think someone actually in Congress had to fight to get any footage released. And you had people that were saying, no, it was a missile. Well, they swept everything nearby. So that's what this is kind of reminding me of: a Fed sweep. They pretend that they want more information, but in reality, they want to make sure that they have all of the information, all of the footage, so that they can control the narrative. Except sometimes things don't go as planned. Because before people realize they have anything, or maybe when they're trying to reach out to the feds, they're texting a friend who texts a friend. ^t-00-04-43

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(326); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:05:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-05-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And the next thing you know, the whole neighborhood and all of Orem has something. And this is what happened. Something made its way around the entire town and into my tips line repeatedly. It is a very clear image of Tyler Robinson, allegedly taken, I'll say allegedly for safety here, but it's looking right according to my timeline, allegedly taken at 6:38 p.m. at a nearby Dairy Queen. Here is that photo that we can show you. Just take a look at this photo. What is wrong with this picture? A lot is wrong with this picture. First and foremost, 6:38 p.m., you just shot someone. ^t-00-05-26

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(367); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:06:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-06-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You have gone through great pains to hide your face, to change your outfit, but wait, you didn't fully change your outfit, did you? I'm looking at this photo and you're wearing jeans and you're wearing the maroon shirt. Now we have a 50-50 combo of the outfits. And now you're showing your eyes and you're not fearful at all that you might be recognized. Also, wow, you must have quite the stomach. You don't have a record. Next thing you know, you shoot someone and you're like, I'm just gonna go have a meal. You don't seem to be too shaken or too upset. Something problematic is the location, by the way. We mapped this out. It's about 15 minutes away from the campus at a time when we're told that he's idling by, babysitting the rifle. ^t-00-06-07

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(410); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:06:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-06-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So you can see, we're showing you, it's about a 17-minute drive away from the campus. So there should be a lot of footage then of this Dodge Challenger driving back and forth, okay? And like I said, the biggest thing that jumps at me is he looks kind of content there. So he's got to be a full-blown psychopath, wearing half of what the feds told us he was wearing in the morning and half of what the feds told us that he was wearing during the shooting. Okay, so why did he text in this exchange at all and say that he changed outfits? ^t-00-06-50

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(449); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:07:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-07-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Wouldn't you have just said, I changed my T-shirt, if that's the reality? You just changed your T-shirt and that was enough? Was it just a T-shirt that he changed? The outfit, again, as I sensed yesterday, has always been problematic. I feel the outfit was the Fed mistake. It never made any sense to say that he wore an outfit onto campus, light khaki shorts and a maroon shirt, and then decided to completely change hours later. Because why wouldn't you just change the T-shirt? That actually makes more sense. Every kid wears blue jeans. You don't have to, like, change blue jeans or change out of khaki shorts to avoid detection. Cops are not going to go, hey, we're stopping you because you're wearing blue jeans. That's not a thing. ^t-00-07-29

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(493); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:08:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-08-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It would make much more sense if he had just changed his T-shirts. And like I said yesterday, if you were going to change at all, why did you have to leave campus to do that? And shouldn't the cameras have caught you either way? You take a totally different route. Again, there's cameras everywhere. So we can now plot this change, this alleged Dairy Queen stop, onto our timeline. Right? We can see that right there. We were very accurate when we started getting really serious about looking at a timeline. I like a clean timeline. We said the first correspondence that allegedly took place between these two had to have taken place between Tyler and Lance after six o'clock p.m. Well, there we go. 6:38 p.m. ^t-00-08-13

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(538); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:08:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-08-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We get this confirmed photo, or I should say, I shouldn't say a confirmed photo, an alleged photo of Tyler Robinson buying food at Dairy Queen off campus, on the other side of town. And that's where we can assume... I mean, campus is supposed to be on lockdown. It's supposed to be a manhunt. That's where we can assume these text messages or... Around this time, where Tyler Robinson is signifying that he's close to the scene of the crime, that's where we should be able to find more footage of his vehicle. Maybe you are a shop along this way, near that Dairy Queen, and you should check your footage to see if around this time, 6:38 or else, that you saw a Dodge Challenger go by. ^t-00-08-58

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(580); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:09:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-09-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** A source tells me that they saw him dropping... well, near this Dairy Queen, that there's a cemetery, and he was dropping clothes into that cemetery. Now, we have not gotten anything from the feds about where the clothing was dropped off, where he changed, nothing. My question then is, what is going on? My suspicion, I maintain, is that there are multiple people that are involved. And after receiving this, that suspicion is growing, okay? Like I said, unless that man is a cold-blooded killer. He just seems to be a la-di-da, eating some Dairy Queen, and it's not making sense. ^t-00-09-40

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(623); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:10:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-10-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, there is something that another local told me that the locals are discussing that they believe actually took place, and it rings a lot truer to me, a lot truer than anything that I've heard thus far from the feds. I'm gonna tell you that in a moment, but first, I started to sort of hyper-focus on the doorbell cam footage, right? Because that mysteriously made its way to TMZ the morning after Charlie's assassination. Can we actually... what time did that footage make its way? Just so I can take a look. I'm gonna go on to day two here. When did TMZ release the footage? Well, I don't know exactly the exact day they released the footage. I think it was... ^t-00-10-23

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(663); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:11:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-11-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Their footage said that at 8:07 a.m., TMZ is the first, on September 10th, that tells us that there is doorbell cam footage, but I actually want to see when TMZ released it, so can you just put a note for me, Skylar, that I want to look up when TMZ announced it? I feel like it was in the morning, okay? And so I started asking myself, like, where did that footage come from, right? We should look into that. Let me just say this right away, as a rule: when a tragedy happens, I don't love the people who have the instinct to immediately speak to the press after a tragedy. What I mean to say is that, imagine you, you're on campus somewhere, a shooting happens, students are screaming, they're running, somebody is dead. ^t-00-11-03

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(704); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:11:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-11-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I feel that a normal person's instinct is to make sure their loved ones are okay in their immediate vicinity, make sure they are okay, obviously, and then to call and alert everyone who would be concerned that you're okay, right? Maybe your mom, like you're gonna get on the phone first with, like, your mom and dad. You're not gonna get on the phone with TMZ. You're not gonna get in the... you're not gonna speak to the press first. I don't think so. So it's always a good question when you sense that something is wrong, as I very much sense right now with the Charlie Kirk assassination, to go back and reflect on who opened up to the press with information. Look, if you've been a longtime listener of the show, the mainstream media has been controlled by the CIA since Operation Mockingbird. And so I addressed that question: ^t-00-11-44

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(750); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:12:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-12-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** who is it that gave the footage to TMZ? Why TMZ? Whose instincts would it be to give the footage to TMZ? If you're really just a person living out in Utah, surprised by everything, why are you giving it to, like, TMZ, which covers celebrity gossip out of Hollywood, right? The New York Post. That's not supposed to be a local paper, a local news source. Why would you hit up the New York Post? Which Utah citizen thought of TMZ first? Was it them or was it the feds? Well, we were able to stalk that. ^t-00-12-30

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(785); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:13:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-13-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** OK, we were able, because gratefully the individual, one of the individuals, who owned the house spoke to a local news station the day after, the morning after, Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. His name, you're going to see, is Erwin Steele. Let's watch that footage of Erwin Steele the next morning. ^t-00-13-05

She says police searched this area for the suspected gunman and his weapon. Just a few streets over was another neighbor who was in his front yard. ^t-00-13-25

And so for something like this to happen is... it's shocking. It's... it's really shocking. ^t-00-14-01

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(855); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:14:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-14-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Seems like a good guy. I have no beef with him. Immediately, actually, I was wondering why were we ever told that it was doorbell cam footage? Obviously it was not doorbell cam footage. It's too high. Hence the height of the footage in general. Secondly, like I said, this clip is from the morning after Charlie Kirk's assassination. So TMZ had already publicized that footage. And so that strikes me as a little odd. That would stipulate that either the feds, like I said, collected that footage the night before and then immediately gave it to TMZ, or this guy himself gave it to TMZ before he gave it to the feds. So we're looking into Erwin and we find that he doesn't just ^t-00-14-15

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(896); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:14:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-14-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** co-own just that one house on the street with somebody else named Samuel Steele, but Samuel and his wife Carrie are the ones that own the house that gave the footage, not Erwin. But Erwin is saying that he lives in that house, but actually we found some other Steeles that live in that house. I'm wondering, okay, that seems a little bit confusing. Maybe you're all family. You just go, okay, well, we kind of own all of these houses, whatever. But that strikes me as a little bit odd. I decided to look a little bit further to see what it was that he was in. What business is your family in? ^t-00-14-56

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(933); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:15:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-15-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And it turns out that they work for an engineering place, a place that makes... called Caldera Engineering. It's a company called Caldera Engineering and ostensibly they manufacture valves. Now that stood out to me, because I just find that the manufacturing of valves keeps coming up when I look into certain people, because you know, I'm all about the genealogy. And I could name three people that I got curious about whose family manufactures valves. I don't know if that's a big business out in Utah, also in Canada. When I was looking into Harley Pasternak, that's exactly what his family did. They were in piping and valves, and I'm going, okay, whatever. ^t-00-15-33

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(973); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:16:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-16-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** A local source told me that virtually everyone on that block works for that company. The Steeles are a big family in Orem. Okay, fine. And it's like, yeah, that's something that our source, we have a very good source, said: that whole block is pretty much employees of that engineering company, Caldera. Okay, just put that in the back of my mind. Looking for some other witnesses, I decided... witnesses pertaining to Tyler Robinson. We have a second witness. And her account is kind of confusing to me, and I'm gonna tell you why. First and foremost, her last name also happens to be Steele, but this one witnessed something four hours away. ^t-00-16-13

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1016); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:16:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-16-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Her name is Sherry Steele, and she spoke to the BBC about how she had witnessed the police swarm the townhouse of Tyler Robinson and Lance while she was walking her dog in the evening. Here is what she says. I'm gonna read it directly here from the article. This is from the article. It reads, “Sherry Steele, who lives across the street from the residence, came back from an evening walk to see a large police presence. In a video that she showed the BBC”—for some reason the BBC is not publishing this video—“a loud voice, which she said belonged to the authorities, can be heard shouting, ‘Freeze,’ and ‘Come out now.’” ^t-00-16-56

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1056); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:17:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-17-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** “It just kind of blows your mind, coming up the street and all of a sudden there are helicopters above your house,” Ms. Steele said, adding that she had never spoken to Mr. Robinson. Okay. Couple of things that don't work about the testimony to me. First and foremost, it doesn't work with my timeline. I really care about my timeline here, okay? She says she's walking her dog in the evening. We are told by the feds, well, 33 hours should have been nighttime, right? Their 33 hours should have been 9 p.m. is when Tyler Robinson then turned himself in. But then we found out from other sources that actually it was more like seven o'clock p.m. You know, feds are saying 33 hours, that's nine o'clock p.m. ^t-00-17-36

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1098); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:18:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-18-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Certainly wouldn't describe it as an evening walk with your dog at that time. And by the way, at that time, according to our source, they didn't move at all, okay? We're supposed to believe that it was overnight that they brought in Lance and then, according to Lance's own family, it was overnight that they, after bringing Lance in around 11 o'clock p.m.-ish, right, and then overnight is when they then swarm the household and then go through everything. So what's going on here? Second thing about Sherry Steele is I can't find her. ^t-00-18-18

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1139); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:18:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-18-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We stalked, we looked through databases, we contacted Lance's family to see if they're familiar with that name. I cannot find a woman named Sherry Steele that lives in that building complex, nor can I find her alleged footage that the BBC mentions the following morning. I don't... just putting that out there, but let's move on. Because there are going to be two more Steeles, this time minor children. We do know, according to the indictment, that there were children that witnessed, that were there for the shooting. And these children, like I said, are going to provide an eyewitness testimony to Charlie Kirk's shooting and they are with their aunt Tiffany, ^t-00-18-59

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1178); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:19:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-19-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** and they say that they saw what happened up close, and I believe you're going to hear them say that they were a family of 16. So, like I said, my source says there are a ton of Steeles that are in Orem. Here is what these particular Steeles told Good Morning America in the early hours following Charlie's assassination, like the next day. Take a listen. ^t-00-19-38

There was one shot that rang out and everybody instantly looked around and then fell to the ground. People saw Charlie (Charlie Kirk) instantly get shot in the neck and everybody fell to the ground and then people started running and got run over, and I was with my family. We had 16 of us there, so five adults and like 11 children, and we instantly got separated. We're trying to find everybody and we had amazing good Samaritans that grabbed kids. One took my niece and took her to her apartment. Somebody grabbed these two and my daughter and took them over to the tennis courts and stayed with them until I came. ^t-00-20-22

It was hard to, like, know what it was, but then I saw it and I saw blood everywhere, and it hit his artery and then I just fell to the ground. I covered my head with my hands. And then I just started saying a prayer. And then we all ran. We sprinted away. And we ran away. And then we met at the tennis courts. And then we couldn't find anyone.

I can tell you the family's very heavily involved in politics. That woman that you are looking at, her father was a businessman turned councilman. Sister ran for lieutenant governor. They're also featured in another incident. She kind of pops in the news a lot with a mayor. So by all accounts, asking locally, they're a good family. They're heavily involved in politics, but like, the right side of politics, as I would say as somebody who is a conservative. I think that was kind of maybe stripped there, trying to learn more about these individuals. For me personally, I don't love the idea that at this time, the killer is still on the loose. ^t-00-22-52

But I don't need to, I guess, judge the actions of parents. What I do know is we're not getting the full story, okay? And I reached out to those individuals, by the way. I asked them to speak with me. I want to learn more about what they witnessed. I want to learn more about what they say that they heard and what they saw, what happened afterwards, what the setup there is on UVU campus, what time they went there. ^t-00-23-37

Now let me tell you something about what the locals are theorizing. And like I said, it's the first thing that has made sense to me, okay? They are telling me that something—which you will recall—the first people that got out the map of everywhere to look: and this is where the shooter walked and this is what happened and, you know, here's our diagram of where everything took place and he ran to the woods and he grabbed the gun, but we're not really getting too many details about where he got that gun from, we're just kind of told “in the woods.” And this person tells me: ^t-00-24-16

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1499); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:24:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-24-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** actually, the gun was found in the backyard of someone that I know. We all know each other. And it was found by a chicken coop. Like, you could describe it as a wooded area, but, you know, it's pretty suburban here. And it was found by her chicken coop. The locals are theorizing— again, we have no proof of this, ^t-00-24-59

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1520); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:25:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-25-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** but this is what they are saying—is that they're not being honest about the fact that the house right next door to where the gun was found is a mysteriously vacant home that is owned by the university itself, and that that is where they believe that the true shooter ran to following the assassination of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). They think—and again, they're floating a theory here—that Tyler Robinson was instructed to merely drop off his gun, okay, walks onto campus to simply drop off his gun at the chicken coop place. So I'm gonna show you that. Do we have a map of that ^t-00-25-20

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(1562); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:26:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-26-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** vacant property and where the gun location is found? And he says you'd have to be an insider to know that the general direction that that person is running, even though they're very close similarly, would lead him to the vacant home that we've all kind of had questions about. You know, it's kind of been vacant for a while, and actually, where the gun is found, it's... it's just two different places. So his theory is that Tyler Robinson—and this would definitely align with our decoy boy, right? “I did it, I did it. Oh, actually, it turns out that I have child pornography”—is that Tyler and Lance could have gotten mixed up in some deep internet stuff, which makes sense because, as we have learned, Lance is deep on the web. ^t-00-26-02

Again, we are in full theory zone. I'm telling you what I'm hearing from locals. This is not Candace Owens' theory, but this would make more sense to me: that these were just guys that said, okay, if we found something weird on your camera or, wait, on your laptop, here's what you're gonna have to do to get out of this. Maybe they're being blackmailed or threatened, or “you're gonna go to prison for a very long time.” “What you're gonna do is you're gonna take this weapon and you're gonna walk this weapon and you're gonna leave this weapon right here, okay, and that's it. Then you're gonna busy yourself elsewhere around and we will tell you what to do next.” That's their theory about Tyler Robinson. Okay? ^t-00-26-45

Putting it out there. And I can tell you that we are now prodding that narrative and asking: if you are a person who has any footage and you have been instructed not to give any footage whatsoever, I don't know. I can't understand it. If you own the property and it's yours, I don't know how they can tell you it's not yours anymore since, don't forget, Governor Cox said, it's all wrapped up. It's over. We've got him, move on. ^t-00-27-27

Charlie courageously advocated for the sacred principles of freedom, constructive discourse, truth, family values, and common sense. He taught with humor and wisdom, and backed up his beliefs with data and facts. He set a powerful example of reaching out and talking to those who disagreed with him. We mourn his passing, but what he taught us continues to resonate with even more power. A message from all of us at Riverbend Ranch. ^t-00-28-37

We went out there and met them. Fantastic family. Also want to tell you guys about American Financing, because if you've been living on credit cards just to cover groceries, gas and bills, you know those interest rates are brutal. So why keep paying that 20% or more to the banks, when you could call my friends at American Financing? They have mortgage rates that are in the fives, and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their pocket and out of the hands of the credit card companies. Right now, American Financing is helping homeowners save an average of $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high interest debt, with no upfront fees, no obligation, and just a 10-minute call to a salary-based mortgage consultant. And here's the kicker. If you start today, you could delay two mortgage payments, putting even more cash in your hands right away. So do not wait. ^t-00-29-08

That's 800-795-1210. Or visit americanfinancing.net/owens. That's americanfinancing.net/owens. Also telling you guys about Field of Greens because, look, I knew we all have two ages: our actual age, and then there's our body's internal biological age. What I didn't know is I've likely lowered my biological age without even knowing. And here's the thing: it's because Americans eat so many processed foods and not enough fruits and vegetables. Many people, perhaps most, are 10-plus years older on the inside than their actual age. A major university study suggests how to slow down aging. Participants slowed their aging by drinking Field of Greens. That's all they did. They didn't change their eating, drinking, or their exercise. ^t-00-29-52

I feel great knowing that Field of Greens can slow how quickly that I'm aging, and I encourage you guys all to join me. Swap your untested fruit, vegetable or green drink for Field of Greens.

They are all parroting the same talking point. They're clearly collaborating. I can tell you it's a Zionist attack. I just, I've lived through enough of them. This is what they're like. And they all kind of say the same thing, slightly different. And the idea is to pile up and hope that if people keep seeing the same thing, they'll just believe it's true. And of course, Benjamin Netanyahu, defending Benjamin Netanyahu, seems to be at the center of it all. That Zionists control a lot of publications in America. That is just a reality. We can even go through that. It's a little weird that I have never said, throughout discussing this case which I care very much about, that Benjamin Netanyahu murdered Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-31-20

Megyn Kelly never said that. Dave Smith never said that. Instead what we are doing is we are disputing Benjamin Netanyahu's narrative that him and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) were on great terms and really friendly and he had just invited him out and here's this love letter Charlie wrote. He heavily implied that, and he was saying way too much too fast and too soon. That didn't feel right, and we just wanted the truth to be out there. I don't know who specifically came out and said that Bibi killed Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), but now that he's, for the second time, denying that he is, people are going, what's actually going on here? This is weird. When Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated, I didn't feel compelled to come out and make two videos to tell people that I didn't kill him. ^t-00-32-06

Like, you would be like, Candace (Candace Owens), that's very strange. Why do you feel like you need to say that? If Tucker Carlson had to make two videos saying “I didn't kill Charlie Kirk,” you would go, that's weird. Megyn Kelly, “I didn't kill Charlie Kirk.” Why would she do that? Of course she didn't kill Charlie Kirk. But Bibi has come out, like I said, with his second statement and we can listen to it. Take a listen. ^t-00-32-50

Well, somebody has fabricated a monstrous big lie that Israel had something to do with Charlie Kirk's horrific murder. This is insane. It is false. It is outrageous. Charlie Kirk was a giant, a once-in-a-century talent who defended freedom, defended America, defended our common Judeo-Christian civilization. Charlie loved Israel. He loved the Jewish people. He told me so in a letter that he sent me just a few months ago. ^t-00-33-12

He told me, “The Holy Land is so important to my life, it pains me to see support for Israel slip away.” Now, if Charlie disagreed with a policy of mine or a decision here and there, not only did I not mind, I welcomed it. This is the essence of Charlie. This is the essence of a free country. It's exactly what Charlie stood for. And I knew that his suggestions always came from the heart, from his love for Israel and from his love for the Jewish people. ^t-00-33-49

I invited him to visit Israel again. And sadly, that won't happen. Now some are peddling these disgusting rumors, perhaps out of obsession, perhaps with Qatari funding.

If we were taking money from Qatar, it wouldn't be a problem according to your administration and your cronies. So what's this about? I was so hopeful that you would be able to get through that speech without mentioning the Holocaust, but that was kind of the opening liner. “Joseph Goebbels said...” Bro, Joseph Goebbels has nothing on the Zionists in America and the propaganda that they have pushed. ^t-00-35-50

We see what you guys are doing. And you're not making people feel comfortable with the fact that you keep coming out to have to deny something that certainly wasn't asserted by me on this program. And you're doubling down on your lie. I told you to publish the full letter that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wrote you, not lines of it, okay?

You have Bill Ackman. Extraordinarily, I said, I will publish whatever it is that you say, Bill. You can come on the program. We can talk about that trip to the Hamptons. He just kind of... which was, by the way, you guys on Instagram were so funny. I didn't even have to say anything. You guys just saw right through it because we're all awake.

And yeah, actually what's missing from these messages are, like, a date, a context, and they don't dispel anything that I have asserted. So what's going on here?

There's a, no question, proof that Candace Owens is nothing... has nothing to do... she would be, in a perfect world, if they didn't have this, what I already know was a very quiet breakup, where she got too rabbit-hole for him, she would be the logical heir to the TPUSA throne, but she's not.

Eric Bolling, I just don't even get this one. How could you say that I have not spoken at a Turning Point USA conference in years when I literally went on tour with Turning Point USA on college campuses last year? Like, that's just incredible. You didn't know that I went... I was on tour for Turning Point USA last year? You don't remember that happening at all. Okay, then I get fired from The Daily Wire. Turning Point USA is the first to issue a “Christ is King” statement of support. Then I do what was the YWLS conference right after that. So let's just actually bring this in. What you are referring to, which is kind of a part of the story that we're telling you, is that the Zionists started circling Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and trying to control things. This was actually in around September or whatever, and I was always very honest that Charlie and I had a conversation and they were putting pressure on me. “You can't talk to her. She's talking about Israel.” ^t-00-40-46

But Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I am under so much fire right now. Do not even... I'm like radioactive. I don't even worry about the conference. I have to rebuild my whole life. I have to figure out how to get my podcast back on the road. I literally... I'm banned from Australia because I still have designers. Like, I have so much going on. For me not to speak at Amfest is nothing. Like, that doesn't even mean anything. Save yourself. Okay? It means nothing to me. Tell them whatever you need to tell them. And I'm going to focus on trying to rebuild my life, because they also had me canceled from YouTube. ^t-00-41-31

It was insane. Then I came back bigger and I came back stronger, because at the end of the day the truth will win against lies. That's the message. And so the reality is that then they came inward, because that's what Zionists do. They started putting more pressure on him, and this time they didn't want just Candace Owens. It was Tucker Carlson because Tucker went to Amfest and then they said that can't happen again either. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) started realizing which way the wind was blowing. And in fact, in the very week that Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated, he was saying that he wanted me back on the roster. ^t-00-42-15

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(2577); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:42:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-42-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's where his mindset was at. You cannot dispute any of this because it's real. This is... then suddenly he gets a Shulman guy is the one that said, “I want my name off of the building at Turning Point,” in the 48 hours leading up to his assassination, the couple of days leading up to the assassination. They were squeezing him, trying to control who he was allowed to speak to. And that started in real earnest, I can tell you, in Q4 of last year. And then Charlie had had enough, and I've got a lot more that's gonna come out about what happened at Turning Point. It wasn't just that, they were spiking the ball where they were spending the money. It was almost like they just wanted to take over the company that he had built and turn it into just another outfit of the Mossad. Like, that's the information that I have and I wanna make sure that I properly vet everything and go through everything. That's what it looks like. ^t-00-42-57

Okay, so your little talking points and the lies people can look up and research and see that's... that's not true. And that's your big LOL point like, “Oh, well, the proof of this is she's not speaking at Charlie's honoring-Charlie events in Arizona.” And then they asked me these questions, they're like, “When's the last time you spoke to Erica? Did... have you attended a Charlie Kirk...” What is it? Can you pull up the weird things? They're all running with these talking points. This is what we got from the Daily Mail. “Is she planning to attend his memorial service in Arizona? Was she asked to speak or did she ask to be a part of the program?” Why would I ask to be a part? Like, this is obviously Erica is in, like, full control. I would hope she's in full control, but I don't know because I'm hearing some stories about donors that are pushing things, but let's reopen that. ^t-00-43-42

Is she planning to attend? Does she speak to Erica? When's the last time they spoke? Board member Eric Bolling”—by the way, he's not a board member, but that would have been a good fact-check for you, PBD—“said that Charlie Kirk had a quiet breakup with Candace Owens after she got too far down the rabbit hole for him. Has there been any communication between...” “There hasn't been any communication between the two for many years.” Just... it's made up. It's just all made up. And like I said, the reason that they're doing this is because they want us to stop investigating the death of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). I'm convinced this is a full-blown Fed operation. I'm hearing about the pressure that's even happening with planning this event. They're trying to make it seem like, “Oh my, how dare she? Did you even attend a vigil?” Except with anything... ^t-00-44-25

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(2709); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:45:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-45-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** No, actually, I didn't attend a vigil. And nope, you're right. You got me. I was not invited to speak alongside President Trump (Donald Trump) and JD Vance on the stage with Tucker Carlson at a memorial event. What does this have to do with anything? The answer is it has to do with nothing. They're working on a narrative like they always do. They're coming in, they're squeezing, and they're trying to pretend that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I didn't speak for years. It could not be further from the truth. Okay? Charlie and I never, for a single second, stopped being friends. Ever. Never happened. They can't produce one shred of evidence to that effect. Nope. Just donors. And the donors at Turning Point need to be investigated. ^t-00-45-09

And guess what? If it's gotta be me, and you need to hate me forever, that's totally fine. On top of that, talk about a federal operation. Out of nowhere, Brigitte Macron just lies. I don't even know how they got this in the press. This is so dumb. Brigitte Macron comes out and says they have offered scientific evidence to the U.S. court to prove that Brigitte is a woman. That's what her lawyer says. Well, the lawyer's a liar because we haven't even started this case yet. So how could you have offered scientific proof to a court to prove you're a woman, especially because you're not suing me over the claim that I said you were born a man. ^t-00-45-49

I guess you were born a boy—a male is what I should say. You were born a male and you've never sued anybody for making that statement. You sue for things around it. You're suing me because you're saying, well, you said I stole the identity from my sister. I'm not a thief. You've never sued anybody for the claim that you were born male. So I don't know what this is, just like, we're just gonna all howl at Candace to try to distract her from looking into Charlie Kirk's murder and assassination, but it's focusing me more because this is not normal. ^t-00-46-31

You're not gonna break me, okay? I watched him catch a bullet in the throat and we're being lied to by everybody about who was involved, why it happened, and why you are attacking the people—who are the person, rather—who is trying to investigate it. You're not a good friend, they say, if you investigate this. Now they're running the, “How dare you get clicks for investigating.” What? This has been... this is my show. “How dare you get clicks as we get clicks off of Candace getting clicks.” You morons. You guys think we're that stupid? “How dare Candice get clicks as we get clicks off of Candice getting clicks.” It's so asinine. You're so stupid. And the entire world is watching. And that's what's problematic. Left and right, we are realizing something more sinister happened. If we're not taking the MAGA bait, “the dad MAGA, he's been more MAGA than ever.” ^t-00-47-14

Like, what happened recently? Like, we're in September. Like, what happened that someone would commit themselves further to Trump (Donald Trump)? More MAGA than ever. In fact, it's been kind of the opposite. People think we're occupied by Zionists. More MAGA people are going, like, it seems like Trump has kind of given up on free speech and his administration seems to be controlled by Bibi Net and Yahoo, so that doesn't ring true either. And then it's like, oh, over here, the trans, the trans, neither. Left and right, we're paying attention, and we're looking up at who rules over us, and it's not a pretty picture.

This type of theft does not happen by breaking down your doors and stealing your stuff. It happens with a one-page document with a forged signature that gets filed at the county. If your title—that's the legal record of ownership—gets transferred out of your name, criminals are using your ownership to drain your equity or even sell your property. And you won't even know about it until you start getting collection or foreclosure notices in the mail. That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock so that you can protect your equity and find out today if you're already a victim. You can use my promo code Candice at hometitlelock.com and you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock protection, which is 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes, and if fraud occurs, their U.S.-based restoration team will spend up to $1 million to fix it. ^t-00-50-01

Like I said, it's just what they do. You know, they've got people in their back pocket, lawyers, corrupt lawyers doing their bidding. I mean, they created the system and then they mock us for participating in the system. Like I told you, Bill Ackman at this Hamptons retreat, according to one of the attendees, told them that they shouldn't even aspire to own a home and they should just give money to stocks. Like, okay, I'm sure you own no homes. They just want to turn us all into slaves.

That is, by the way, in large part, from what I understand, being controlled by the White House. Trump (Donald Trump) is controlled by Zionists, so they're baiting me here.

All leads will be pursued. You can make me persona non grata, okay? I'm happy with that. I'm very content because I'm locked in and I'm focused. Trevor Miller writes, something is wrong. ^t-00-56-28

Yes, I am calling on the left and the right to unify and to solve what happened on September 10th, okay? All of us, left and right. Jean Machine writes, seriously, our last chance at making a real change to anything. Keep going, Candice. Thank you. Kristen writes, it's not right versus left. It's not black versus white. It's not gay versus straight. It is good versus evil and the truth versus lie. Yes, ma'am. Leslie writes, you are relentless, Candice. Do not let up. I won't and I see you guys in the comments, they can put out what they want. I see you guys gang gang, like, nope, nope, watched it, lies. ^t-00-57-13

Thank you for that. I don't know how they just allowed him to lie like that. It's such an easy thing that could have been debunked. But I'm built for this. Like, you get built different when you watch someone who you know very well, who you were very close to, who you built with, someone who was beside you when you were nobody, he was nobody. When you watch that person catch a bullet, you really start to comprehend the evil of this world, the evil that we are fighting, and we are only going to conquer this evil through truth. That's it. We got to wake up everybody's eyes at the exact same time. Khalid Mohammed writes, good luck with everything. Thank you. Cynthia Martinez writes, Candice, you are divinely protected. ^t-00-57-57

He is. You are wrapped in their protection, wisdom and triumph. You inspire my family and I. Falalina writes, here's some Qatari funding for your godsent mission. Falalina, are you in Qatar? Was it you? Always praying for you and your family's safety in Jesus' almighty name, love from Montreal. Falalina, the Qatari. She's the single Qatari individual. Anyways, you guys know my real funding always comes from you guys. Thank you to everyone who has bought sweatshirts and hats and gear on our website and signed up. ^t-00-58-37

And we're willing to research. And I wish I had a bigger team. We're tiny. ^t-00-59-21
