That is all happening right now, not because I'm lying, but because we are choosing to stay focused on solving the murder of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. And what we are uncovering is much darker than I think any of us could have possibly imagined.

And I guess we should just start with one of many explosive discoveries—thanks to all of you guys, by the way: anonymous sources invested in So we've been wondering. Yesterday, I was also doing a set, an <span id="ent-org-instagram-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/org-instagram.md">Instagram</a></span> series of pulling everybody into what doesn't make sense about the changing of the clothes. That <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> allegedly did. And we've been wondering why it seems the feds were only willing to release a grainy<span id="event-event-2025-09-09-photo-of-suspect-tyler-robinson-at-dairy-queen-pos-t-00-01-20"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-09-photo-of-suspect-tyler-robinson-at-dairy-queen-pos.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> image of <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> from the day of the shooting, despite the tech stack that <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> campus has, right? ^t-00-01-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-02-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=125" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** There's no images that we can see that have been released of his Dodge Challenger that's supposed to be idling nearby the campus for a very long time, right? As he texted these Fed messages—him and Lance are texting, and he's telling him every second, minute by minute, what he's done—and he mentions that the cops have done a sweep, remember? Tyler (Tyler Robinson) is supposed to be babysitting the gun in that moment, waiting for the right moment to go back and, quote-unquote, retrieve his weapon. But he sees a—and I'm not kidding—quote-unquote, squad car. That's what he writes, right? ^t-00-02-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-02-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=165" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="claim-claim-b86b19529bd8-t-00-02-45">He writes, "I can get close to it, but there is a squad car parked right by it." Squad car<a href="/claims/claim-b86b19529bd8.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. Okay, yeah, no. How many times do you call a police car a squad car? Do you want to know who calls it a squad car? Someone on the squad. Well, that's how that works. <span id="claim-claim-476b610c23ef-t-00-02-45">Yeah, but that's what Tyler (Tyler Robinson) writes: squad car<a href="/claims/claim-476b610c23ef.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. Elsewhere in this correspondence, and by the way, thanks to one of you people who commented on yesterday's episode and pointed this out to me. But elsewhere, Tyler (Tyler Robinson) says something that only a woman would say. That's why it didn't flag me as weird when I was reading this; it didn't flag me as odd. <span id="claim-claim-30468909fae8-t-00-02-45">He says to Lance, allegedly, quote, "I worry about prints."<a href="/claims/claim-30468909fae8.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> ^t-00-02-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-03-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=206" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** "I had to leave it," referring to the rifle, "in a bush where I changed outfits." Wait, changed outfits. Somebody commented, "Men don't say outfits." That's a woman thing. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's true. I would say I changed my outfit. A man does not say, "You just say you changed clothes." You would not say an outfit. Outfit is very girly. Okay, so is this AI or is this a female Fed that put these messages together? We're not feeling like it's <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-03-26"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>. That's for sure. Now, another question we ask is: if there is this much available footage, why not, to relieve everybody, to make us feel like this is not a federal operation, why not just release anything to the public? ^t-00-03-26

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-04-09.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:09</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=249" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="claim-claim-bcfc858b0083-t-00-04-09">Well, the reason is because, according to locals—many of which have emailed me—any of the footage that they had, any footage that they found, they immediately sent over to the feds, and the feds told them that they were not allowed to share it at all<a href="/claims/claim-bcfc858b0083.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. Like there was some risk if you shared this at all; it's not going to be good for you. Like they are kind of being pressured by the feds not to share things publicly. And that's why I would say 9-10 is beginning to remind me of 9-11, right? The feds sweep through everything to make sure that they have all of the footage so that no one can question the narrative that they put out. ^t-00-04-09

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-04-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=283" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It makes me think, you know, how long did it take before they were willing to show us any footage of the alleged giant Boeing plane that hit the <span id="ent-org-united-states-pentagon-t-00-04-43"><a href="/entities/org-united-states-pentagon.md">Pentagon</a></span> building? We weren't allowed to see that for a very long time. I think someone actually in <span id="ent-org-united-states-congress-t-00-04-43"><a href="/entities/org-united-states-congress.md">Congress</a></span> had to fight to get any footage released. And you had people that were saying, "No, it was a missile." Well, they swept everything nearby. So that's what this is kind of reminding me of: a Fed sweep. <span id="claim-claim-262b1b3dd6c1-t-00-04-43">They pretend that they want more information, but in reality, they want to make sure that they have all of the information, all of the footage, so that they can control the narrative.<a href="/claims/claim-262b1b3dd6c1.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> Except sometimes things don't go as planned. Because before people realize they have anything, or maybe when they're trying to reach out to the feds, they're texting a friend who texts a friend. ^t-00-04-43

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-05-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=326" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And the next thing you know, the whole neighborhood and all of <span id="ent-gpe-orem-t-00-05-26"><a href="/entities/gpe-orem.md">Orem</a></span> has something. And this is what happened. Something made its way around the entire town and into my tips line repeatedly. <span id="claim-claim-d1eecb7e7c76-t-00-05-26">It is a very clear image of <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-05-26"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>, allegedly taken—I'll say allegedly for safety here, but it's looking right according to my timeline—allegedly taken at 6:38 p.m<a href="/claims/claim-d1eecb7e7c76.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. at a nearby Dairy Queen. Here is that photo that we can show you. Just take a look at this photo. What is wrong with this picture? A lot is wrong with this picture. First and foremost, 6:38 p.m.—you just shot someone. ^t-00-05-26

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-06-07.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:07</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=367" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** You have gone through great pains to hide your face, to change your outfit, but wait, you didn't fully change your outfit, did you? <span id="claim-claim-7087d4084a91-t-00-06-07">I'm looking at this photo, and you're wearing jeans, and you're wearing the maroon shirt<a href="/claims/claim-7087d4084a91.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. Now we have a 50-50 combo of the outfits. And now you're showing your eyes, and you're not fearful at all that you might be recognized. Also, wow, you must have quite the stomach. You don't have a record. Next thing you know, you shoot someone, and you're like, "I'm just gonna go have a meal." You don't seem to be too shaken or too upset. Something problematic is the location, by the way. We mapped this out. It's about 15 minutes away from the campus at a time when we're told that he's idling by, babysitting the rifle. ^t-00-06-07

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-06-50.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:50</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=410" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="claim-claim-115e8d697f35-t-00-06-50">So you can see—we're showing you—it's about a 17-minute drive away from the campus<a href="/claims/claim-115e8d697f35.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. So there should be a lot of footage then of this Dodge Challenger driving back and forth, okay? And like I said, the biggest thing that jumps at me is he looks kind of content there. So he's got to be a full-blown psychopath, wearing half of what the feds told us he was wearing in the morning and half of what the feds told us that he was wearing during the shooting. Okay, so why did he text in this exchange at all and say that he changed outfits? ^t-00-06-50

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-07-29.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:29</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=449" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Wouldn't you have just said, "I changed my T-shirt," if that's the reality? You just changed your T-shirt and that was enough? Was it just a T-shirt that he changed? The outfit, again—as I sensed yesterday—has always been problematic. I feel the outfit was the Fed mistake. It never made any sense to say that he wore an outfit onto campus—light khaki shorts and a maroon shirt—and then decided to completely change hours later. Because why wouldn't you just change the T-shirt? That actually makes more sense. Every kid wears blue jeans. You don't have to, like, change blue jeans or change out of khaki shorts to avoid detection. Cops are not going to go, "Hey, we're stopping you because you're wearing blue jeans." That's not a thing. ^t-00-07-29

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-08-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=493" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It would make much more sense if he had just changed his T-shirts. And like I said yesterday, if you were going to change at all, why did you have to leave campus to do that? And shouldn't the cameras have caught you either way? You take a totally different route. Again, there's cameras everywhere. So we can now plot this change, this alleged Dairy Queen stop, onto our timeline. Right? We can see that right there. We were very accurate when we started getting really serious about looking at a timeline. I like a clean timeline. We said the first correspondence that allegedly took place between these two had to have taken place between Tyler (Tyler Robinson) and Lance after six o'clock p.m. Well, there we go. 6:38 p.m. ^t-00-08-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-08-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=538" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** We get this confirmed photo—or I should say, I shouldn't say a confirmed photo—an alleged photo of <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-08-58"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> buying food at Dairy Queen off campus, on the other side of town. And that's where we can assume... I mean, campus is supposed to be on lockdown. It's supposed to be a manhunt. That's where we can assume these text messages or... Around this time, where <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> is signifying that he's close to the scene of the crime, that's where we should be able to find more footage of his vehicle. Maybe you are a shop along this way, near that Dairy Queen, and you should check your footage to see if around this time—6:38 or else—that you saw a Dodge Challenger go by. ^t-00-08-58

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-09-40.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:40</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=580" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** A source tells me that they saw him dropping—well, near this Dairy Queen, that there's a cemetery—and he was dropping clothes into that cemetery. Now, we have not gotten anything from the feds about where the clothing was dropped off, where he changed, nothing. My question then is, what is going on? My suspicion—I maintain—is that there are multiple people that are involved. And after receiving this, that suspicion is growing, okay? Like I said, unless that man is a cold-blooded killer. He just seems to be la-di-da, eating some Dairy Queen, and it's not making sense. ^t-00-09-40

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-10-23.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=623" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, there is something that another local told me that the locals are discussing that they believe actually took place, and it rings a lot truer to me, a lot truer than anything that I've heard thus far from the feds. I'm gonna tell you that in a moment, but first, I started to sort of hyper-focus<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-tmz-releases-doorbell-cam-footage-from-kirk-shooti-t-00-10-23"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-tmz-releases-doorbell-cam-footage-from-kirk-shooti.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> on the doorbell cam footage, right? Because that mysteriously made its way to<span id="event-event-2025-09-18-bill-ackman-publishes-text-messages-related-to-cha-t-00-10-23"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-18-bill-ackman-publishes-text-messages-related-to-cha.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-18-benjamin-netanyahu-denies-involvement-in-charlie-k-t-00-10-23"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-18-benjamin-netanyahu-denies-involvement-in-charlie-k.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-09-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-during-event-at-uvu-camp-t-00-10-23"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-09-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-during-event-at-uvu-camp.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> TMZ the morning after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-23"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination. Can we actually... what time did that footage make its way? Just so I can take a look. I'm gonna go on to day two here. When did TMZ release the footage? Well, I don't know exactly the exact day they released the footage. I think it was... ^t-00-10-23

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-11-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:11:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=663" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Their footage said that at 8:07 a.m., TMZ is the first—on <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-11-03"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>—that tells us that there is doorbell cam footage. But I actually want to see when TMZ released it, so can you just put a note for me, Skylar, that I want to look up when TMZ announced it? I feel like it was in the morning, okay? And so I started asking myself, like, where did that footage come from, right? We should look into that. Let me just say this right away, as a rule: when a tragedy happens, I don't love the people who have the instinct to immediately speak to the press after a tragedy. What I mean to say is that, imagine you—you're on campus somewhere—a shooting happens, students are screaming, they're running, somebody is dead. ^t-00-11-03

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-sreYYcID-QY/t-00-11-44.md" class="timestamp-link">00:11:44</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sreYYcID-QY&t=704" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I feel that a normal person's instinct is to make sure their loved ones are okay in their immediate vicinity, make sure they are okay—obviously—and then to call and alert everyone who would be concerned that you're okay, right? Maybe your mom—like you're gonna get on the phone first with, like, your mom and dad. You're not gonna get on the phone with TMZ. You're not gonna get in the... you're not gonna speak to the press first. I don't think so.

I have no beef with him. Immediately, actually, I was wondering why were we ever told that it was doorbell cam footage? Obviously it was not doorbell cam footage. It's too high. Hence the height of the footage in general. <span id="claim-claim-181ad7e8bd81-t-00-14-12">Secondly, like I said, this clip is from the morning after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-14-12"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination<a href="/claims/claim-181ad7e8bd81.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. So TMZ had already publicized that footage. And so that strikes me as a little odd. That would stipulate that either the feds—like I said—collected that footage the night before and then immediately gave it to TMZ, or this guy himself gave it to TMZ before he gave it to the feds. So we're looking into Erwin, and we find that he doesn't just co-own just that one house on the street with somebody else named <span id="ent-person-samuel-steele-t-00-14-12"><a href="/entities/person-samuel-steele.md">Samuel Steele</a></span>, but Samuel and his wife Carrie are the ones that own the house that gave the footage, not Erwin. ^t-00-14-12

I'm wondering, okay, that seems a little bit confusing. Maybe you're all family. You just go, "Okay, well, we kind of own all of these houses, whatever." But that strikes me as a little bit odd. I decided to look a little bit further to see what it was that he was in. What business is your family in? And it turns out that they work for an engineering place, a place that makes—called <span id="ent-org-caldera-engineering-t-00-14-56"><a href="/entities/org-caldera-engineering.md">Caldera Engineering</a></span>. ^t-00-14-56

Now that stood out to me, because I just find that the manufacturing of valves keeps coming up when I look into certain people—because, you know, I'm all about the genealogy. And I could name three people that I got curious about whose family manufactures valves. I don't know if that's a big business out in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-15-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>, also in <span id="ent-gpe-canada-t-00-15-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-canada.md">Canada</a></span>.

Her name is <span id="ent-person-sherry-steele-t-00-16-13"><a href="/entities/person-sherry-steele.md">Sherry Steele</a></span>, and she spoke to the BBC about how she had witnessed the police swarm the townhouse of <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> and Lance while she was walking her dog in the evening. ^t-00-16-13

It reads, “<span id="ent-person-sherry-steele-t-00-16-56"><a href="/entities/person-sherry-steele.md">Sherry Steele</a></span>, who lives across the street from the residence, came back from an evening walk to see a large police presence. In a video that she showed the BBC”—for some reason the BBC is not publishing this video—“a loud voice, which she said belonged to the authorities, can be heard shouting, ‘Freeze,’ and ‘Come out now.’” “It just kind of blows your mind, coming up the street and all of a sudden there are helicopters above your house,” Ms. Steele said, adding that she had never spoken to Mr. <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-16-56"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a></span>. ^t-00-16-56

Couple of things that don't work about the testimony to me. First and foremost, it doesn't work with my timeline. I really care about my timeline here, okay? She says she's walking her dog in the evening. We are told by the feds—well, 33 hours should have been nighttime, right? Their 33 hours should have been 9 p.m. is when <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-17-36"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> then turned himself in. But then we found out from other sources that actually it was more like seven o'clock p.m. You know, feds are saying 33 hours; that's nine o'clock p.m. Certainly wouldn't describe it as an evening walk with your dog at that time. ^t-00-17-36

We're supposed to believe that it was overnight that they brought in Lance, and then—according to Lance's own family—it was overnight that they, after bringing Lance in around 11 o'clock p.m.-ish, right, and then overnight is when they then swarm the household and then go through everything. So what's going on here? Second thing about <span id="ent-person-sherry-steele-t-00-18-18"><a href="/entities/person-sherry-steele.md">Sherry Steele</a></span> is I can't find her. <span id="claim-claim-3d3a54f5fdd3-t-00-18-18">We stalked; we looked through databases; we contacted Lance's family to see if they're familiar with that name<a href="/claims/claim-3d3a54f5fdd3.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. ^t-00-18-18

They are telling me that something—which you will recall—the first people that got out the map of everywhere to look: and this is where the shooter walked, and this is what happened, and, you know, here's our diagram of where everything took place, and he ran to the woods, and he grabbed the gun. But we're not really getting too many details about where he got that gun from; we're just kind of told “in the woods.” And this person tells me: ^t-00-24-06

We all know each other. And it was found by a chicken coop. Like, you could describe it as a wooded area, but, you know, it's pretty suburban here. And it was found by her chicken coop. The locals are theorizing— again, we have no proof of this, ^t-00-24-33

They think—and again, they're floating a theory here—that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-25-18"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> was instructed to merely drop off his gun, okay? Walks onto campus to simply drop off his gun at the chicken coop place. So I'm gonna show you that. Do we have a map of that vacant property and where the gun location is found? And he says you'd have to be an insider to know that the general direction that that person is running—even though they're very close similarly—would lead him to the vacant home that we've all kind of had questions about. You know, it's kind of been vacant for a while, and actually, where the gun is found, it's... it's just two different places. ^t-00-25-18

This is not <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-26-45"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>' theory, but this would make more sense to me: that these were just guys that said, "Okay, if we found something weird on your camera or, wait, on your laptop, here's what you're gonna have to do to get out of this." Maybe they're being blackmailed or threatened, or “you're gonna go to prison for a very long time.” “What you're gonna do is you're gonna take this weapon, and you're gonna walk this weapon, and you're gonna leave this weapon right here, okay? And that's it. Then you're gonna busy yourself elsewhere around, and we will tell you what to do next.” That's their theory about <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-26-45"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>.

We went out there and met them. Fantastic family. Also want to tell you guys about American Financing, because if you've been living on credit cards just to cover groceries, gas, and bills, you know those interest rates are brutal. So why keep paying that 20% or more to the banks when you could call my friends at American Financing? They have mortgage rates that are in the fives, and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their pocket and out of the hands of the credit card companies. Right now, American Financing is helping homeowners save an average of $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high-interest debt, with no upfront fees, no obligation, and just a 10-minute call to a salary-based mortgage consultant. And here's the kicker. If you start today, you could delay two mortgage payments, putting even more cash in your hands right away. ^t-00-29-04

Also telling you guys about Field of Greens because, look, I knew we all have two ages: our actual age, and then there's our body's internal biological age. What I didn't know is I've likely lowered my biological age without even knowing. And here's the thing: it's because Americans eat so many processed foods and not enough fruits and vegetables. Many people—perhaps most—are 10-plus years older on the inside than their actual age. A major university study suggests how to slow down aging. Participants slowed their aging by drinking ^t-00-29-46

That's all they did. They didn't change their eating, drinking, or their exercise. They just had Field of Greens because each fruit and vegetable in Field of Greens was doctor-selected for specific health benefits: cell health, heart, lungs, kidneys, and metabolism—even a healthy weight as well. I feel great knowing that Field of Greens can slow how quickly that I'm aging, and I encourage you guys all to join me. Swap your untested fruit, vegetable, or green drink for Field of Greens.

It happens with a one-page document with a forged signature that gets filed at the county. If your title—that's the legal record of ownership—gets transferred out of your name, criminals are using your ownership to drain your equity or even sell your property. And you won't even know about it until you start getting collection or foreclosure notices in the mail. That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock so that you can protect your equity and find out today if you're already a victim. You can use my promo code Candace (Candace Owens) at hometitlelock.com, and you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock protection, which is 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes, and—if fraud occurs—their U.S.-based restoration team will spend up to $1 million to fix it. That's hometitlelock.com, promo code Candace (Candace Owens), or use the link below. ^t-00-50-01

You know, they've got people in their back pocket—lawyers, corrupt lawyers doing their bidding. I mean, they created the system, and then they mock us for participating in the system.

Like, okay, I'm sure you own no homes. They just want to turn us all into slaves.

Got nothing to do... First off, the memorial is also an open event. So that is even crazier. But this is their sink line done, right? They're like, “Well, are you speaking? Are you one of the five people that's speaking at this event?” No, I'm not. And guess what? That's not going to stop me from looking into this and understanding what exactly has happened. You're trying to make us move on because you know that you messed up. You know you messed up, and it's got something to do with the clothing.
