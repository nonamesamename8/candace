**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-00-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I just want to say that I feel like at the beginning of this investigation, I was very clear. I said there will be no fakeness, and there will be no gayness in this investigation. And apparently there were some people who did not take me seriously or literally, because there are a lot of little lies being told. Right? Charlie (Charlie Kirk) gets assassinated, and the very people who were threatening him reputationally and financially are now trying to memorialize him as having died as a friend of Israel. Okay, challenge accepted. All lies will be revealed, and we're going to help reveal those lies. ^t-00-00-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=39" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-00-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Also, yesterday we asked for the public's help in identifying two individuals who Phil Lyman's nephew described as his close friends who decided to retrace the path of Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) killer. And what we have discovered thus far is absolutely stunning. This story couldn't get any crazier. By the way, I did speak to Phil Lyman, and I'll tell you what he told me and what he insisted that we clarify. Now, I would say that it's getting weird, but honestly, right from the jump, it's been weird. So welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=90" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-01-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** It took him a little over two weeks, but now Benjamin Netanyahu, with maybe a little help from Turning Point USA (I'm thinking), is releasing the letter, the May love letter from Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) to Israel, just out of nowhere. He was just overcome with love for Israel. And he decided to write this love letter to the prime minister about how they could fight harder, how they could commit themselves further to the Israeli cause. We're gonna get to that. And we're just going to slaughter that narrative that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died pro-Israel. But first, I want to jump right back into what we uncovered yesterday to keep you guys focused. I presented to you guys, in short, that the gubernatorial candidate, Phil Lyman, ^t-00-01-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=133" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-02-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** was a bit—in my opinion—too involved in the investigation of who assassinated Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). Just, he was saying and doing a little too much, and his energy was weird, and the energy of Tiffany Barker was weird. And we were clear that's potentially just because, you know, he's a politician, an aspiring politician. Maybe he wants to assert himself as a leader in Utah. This assassination has taken place. But I also felt like maybe he potentially knew a bit more than he was letting on. Now, the Lyman family in general was everywhere all over this investigation. ^t-00-02-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=170" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-02-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** We introduced—and I said his name was Shane; I'd like to correct that record—his nephew, Shaner Broderick, who rather notoriously retraced the footpath of the killer with his two close friends. They were like, "Here, here it is." The Converse footprint is right here. They even created a map. Okay, Shaner even created a map of where exactly the killer walked, and the media used his map. And of course, the Lymans' car was in the driveway just 20 minutes before—I feel Lyman reiterated to Fox News—which is 20 minutes before I pulled into the driveway at my aunt's house, and I parked my car, and then 20 minutes later, the killer killer was limping by. ^t-00-02-50

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=215" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-03-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, I'll let you guys know that when our episode finished yesterday, I had a message or two from Phil Lyman—despite the fact that I had reached out to him hours before we began our show—and he was understandably upset. He, at first, was sort of focusing his energy toward Nick, the person that I told you worked on his campaign and just wanted to help out in the investigation. Now, Phil would like me to clarify that Nick never worked on his campaign. And by the way, I looked back, and that was actually my mistake, not Nick's. I thought that when Nick had first introduced Lyman to me over the phone, that he said, "Oh, like, I am, you know, I'm working on his campaign." And apparently, that was not accurate. ^t-00-03-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=259" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-04-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So I take full credit for that. That was completely—again—something that I came up with by accident. Now, the other things that he was interested in me clarifying were also not really substantive issues. And I want to say that Nick having not worked on his campaign actually makes it even more odd that he would stop by his house this past Saturday. Regarding why, by the way, he stopped by Nick's house at all on Saturday, he said that it was because he was helping Nick out early on in the investigation. Yes, that is true. I told you guys that. ^t-00-04-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=296" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-04-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And Nick was particularly asking him to determine who owned a white vehicle that was parked in the neighborhood—which was nearby where the shooter had walked. Nick lives nearby, and everyone locally had looked at this vehicle and said that it was remarkably suspicious. And Phil had come back to him and said, "I can help you figure out more about this vehicle that was parked." Nick had nothing but a picture of that. But that was over two weeks ago. So I have no idea why that would have anything to do with why he was stopping by Nick's place. Obviously, that car is long gone. It's been gone. And the fact that it appeared and then disappeared is one of the reasons why Nick wanted somebody to look into it. ^t-00-04-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=338" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-05-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm not entirely clear why he needed to stop at Nick's house to speak to him and why that would be on his list of things to do now. I am told—according to a very strong source—that what Phil Lyman was doing in town on Saturday was he was meeting with Tim Ballard. That's totally random. Did not expect to hear that. Tim Ballard, if you're not familiar with him, is formerly of Operation Underground Railroad, which is a charity that is dedicated to helping to stop human sex trafficking. ^t-00-05-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=372" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-06-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I even remember, by the way, when we were all speaking about that plane transponder that turned off, that the individuals that owned that plane were wearing an Operation Underground Railroad t-shirt. So I wasn't expecting that. I am going to reach out to Tim Ballard. I know him. I've actually interviewed him. And I used to donate to that charity because I was so moved by my interview with him when I was working for Prager University. But moving on from that, Phil also disputes something that was quite strange: that Shaner Broderick is his nephew. I said, "Okay, wait a minute." Actually, Shaner Broderick literally posted that on his Instagram. He said, "My uncle, Phil Lyman." But Phil seems like he's trying to distance himself for some reason from Shaner. ^t-00-06-12

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=415" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-06-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** He said, "Actually, maybe Shaner's confused." "We're just cousins." "We're just cousins." Okay, well, Shaner must have been very confused because it was also posted on his LinkedIn as a connection that Phil Lyman was his uncle. It's probably part of the reason—politically speaking—that he was chosen for an internship with Senator Mike Lee of Utah. I feel like that was a little bit of political maneuvering. So I'm not clear why he's suddenly saying that it's not his nephew. Anyway, it's not up to me. I'm not here to get into the middle of a family feud. But something interesting happened since our episode: Shaner completely wiped his LinkedIn page. He doesn't want us to know who he's connected to. ^t-00-06-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=458" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-07-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** He's also completely wiped his Facebook page entirely. And regarding his Instagram, he's privatized it, but he privatized it and then removed all of the photos of his investigation into who Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) killer was. Now, that doesn't make any sense to me. I don't understand that. I can't make sense of why you would just move to delete everything when I've reached out to you—as opposed to speaking to me about where you were, why you shot this video, and maybe sending me that video in general. But again, that is now a dead end. ^t-00-07-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=491" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-08-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, I asked Phil Lyman three times via text whether or not he could help us—more importantly—identify the two individuals that were in the photo with his nephew or cousin, if you will. And he was kind of pretending to be confused about what photo in particular I was referring to—despite the fact that I sent it multiple times in the text chain. And then finally he said that he had no idea who those two individuals were at all. I thought that's interesting. This is allegedly your nephew, cousin. You guys are all chilling on this block around the same time. He's with these two individuals. You've never heard of them. You've never seen them. Nothing. Because I got to identify that guy in the blue hat. ^t-00-08-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=533" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-08-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Many of you figured out, by the way, and wrote to the tips box exactly what we were interested about in that person with the blue hat. You noticed the same thing that we noticed. He kind of resembles, certainly more so than Tyler Robinson does, the blurred image of the individual that was coming up the stairs. I couldn't look away from that. I was going through the photos, and I was going, "Hmm, I would just like to quickly identify that individual and check him off and just know where he was because, yeah, it looks to be about the same height." It's weird. Oddly—this is, when I say oddly, I mean—this has never happened in the history of all of our investigations. ^t-00-08-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=572" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-09-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** No one emailed us to say that they knew either of those two individuals—neither the blonde that's with Shaner nor the person that is wearing the blue hat that is with Shaner. I said, "That's weird." Nobody in the whole wide Candace universe of investigation. It was making me believe maybe those two individuals are like—I don't know—from overseas. Like maybe they're not even American. And it turns out, yeah, we were able to identify one of those individuals in the photo, and he is Austrian. It's no wonder nobody recognized him. I mean, what? Austrian? What's this Austrian guy doing? How did we get here? ^t-00-09-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=616" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-10-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Anyways, his name is Gernot Omer, and we were able to find that his face matched with photos from a blog post that was written in German that was basically entitled “Anniversary Hike: 10 Years on Foot to the Sea.” The blog is about a group of 30-year-olds who were recreating a hike that they took together when they were 20. Now, I don't even know if I'm saying his name right—Gernot, Gurnot. I guess it is a common name in Austria. And there were a few photos of him that were available. ^t-00-10-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=652" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-10-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** We were able to find his face also matched up in a YouTube video for a company called BearingPoint, where he is seen with a group of people and is introduced as one of their software development teams—a member of one of their software development teams. So let's take a listen to that clip from YouTube. [Clip attribution: BearingPoint narrator] ^t-00-10-52

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=689" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-11-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Very recently, he moved to Utah—according to his LinkedIn, which I hope doesn't get wiped. I'd love to get in touch with him. In May of 2024, he moved to Utah to become a software engineer for JPMorgan Chase. And I guess the story goes that he became best friends with Shaner Broderick. I don't know. We'll find out. Now, what about the other guy, right? So, yesterday, we were kind of poking fun at the narrative that Phil Lyman seemed to be trying to spin—suggesting that, quote-unquote, "gothic girls" might have been suspicious, that they maybe could have been responsible or aware, at least, that the shooting was going to occur. ^t-00-11-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=734" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-12-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** That was a part of his story. He saw these gothic girls, and they seemed unfazed in all of the chaos, you know? And I thought that was an interesting way to describe someone as gothic. Gratefully, Phil Lyman did send us footage of him after the shots rang out. And I am saying shots, plural, for a reason, because we will show you that video. But first, I want to recap what specifically Phil said publicly about where he was when the shots rang out. Because I vaguely remembered him painting a picture that he was outside. That certainly seems to be what he told both Alex Jones and NewsNation: that he was outside when the shot rang out. Let's take a listen to what he said on Alex Jones.

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=778" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-12-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** [Clip: Phil Lyman on Alex Jones] Just yesterday, someone comes in and says, "Yeah, we've got video." He came off the roof. He walked up. He came up here to the parking lot, got in the car with an individual, and they drove away. Well, that's not the story that came. It's that he escaped another route, and there are people who are coordinating this thing. I do not believe that that .30-06 that they showed—recovered in the bushes—was ever on the roof. I think it was in the bushes to start with. And now I'm not saying that Tyler Robinson wasn't on the roof. I'm not saying he didn't pull a trigger. I know I was in very, very close proximity. So another interesting thing—like I say—I left the front of the stage. I wanted to meet some of my friends and bring them down front. So it was clear at the east end. And I heard this loud boom. I heard this loud bang. And I turned around. ^t-00-12-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=823" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-13-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** I'm looking like, "What was that?" "What was that?" And pretty soon some people started, you know, running. Everyone was trying to process, and I thought, "This is a gunshot, and there's going to be more of them. I thought it could turn into a mass shooting." So I go to the people closest to me. Everyone's ducking down behind the concrete retaining walls, and some of them are still kind of oblivious. But there are two people that were standing there: two girls, very goth, very black, you know. And then I just walked—I stepped up to the side—and I said, "Did that not happen right here?" "Did you hear that?" "Was that right here?" They said, "Yeah, it was just right over there." So they're confirming, yeah, the shooter—or wherever that sound came from—is right here. The thing that didn't really dawn on me is that they were not running. They were not frightened. ^t-00-13-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=865" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-14-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** In fact, as I stepped up, I heard one of the girls—and they were talking to each other—and they're looking at these kids, looking at the scene down below them of all these people fleeing for their lives. And she says, "Go F yourselves." And like I said, I was not processing. I was trying to figure out what was going on. I thought this is a separate conversation. I don't know what it is. In hindsight, as I've watched that over and over, it's like these people were not afraid. Okay, and on NewsNation, I want you to listen carefully because he at first says that he was about to walk into the building and the shot rang out, but then he says he ran out of the building after the shot rang out. ^t-00-14-25

I had to go meet some people. So I was down there. When he started talking, I thought, "I'm going to go up top and meet some of the people." So I got clear up on top. And I was just coming around the corner, walking into one of the buildings. And I heard a loud bang that I thought was right behind me. And I turned around, looked at the girl that was there. And she was kind of looking stunned. Like, "What was that?" And I'm looking at her. And then I see a little bit of commotion. I realize, right then, it's a gunshot. So I ran out—the people running into the building—I ran out to see who it was. I'm thinking, "This is a lot of kids out here." And then a few minutes later, then the police were running, saying, "Did anybody see?" "Did anybody see?" I think it was on the roof above me. ^t-00-15-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=956" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-15-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, so a couple of those statements are what I would describe as little lies. Well, they're just not true. Because at 12:23—according to his metadata, because he sent it to me—Phil Lyman was inside of the building. And he must have then—immediately, according to our timeline—hit record, and he didn't run. He calmly walked out of Sorensen Building. I hope I'm saying that right: the Sorensen Building. And he wasn't the only one that was walking calmly. And I'm not, by the way, none of these people are suspicious to me walking calmly, because they're inside the building—not really sure what they heard, perhaps—and they're all kind of walking calmly out. And I'm going to show you that footage. And to be clear, you're going to see two girls that are simply wearing black. By no stretch of the imagination ^t-00-15-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1000" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-16-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** would I refer to these girls as gothic. Actually, I think one of them is actually a guy, but they're wearing black—not dark makeup. They're just black. And he asks them—what I can hear audibly—is he asked them, "What was that?" So I don't know how certain he was. It could have been a shooting. But I'm going to let you watch it first, and then we're going to try to clean up the audio. Now, if you're listening to this on a podcast and you're not going to be able to watch this, you might want to turn this down because it is visual. Take a look. You can just sort of see everyone up top. ^t-00-16-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1044" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-17-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** A couple of people who actually were out there are ducking. He was on the inside. Like I said, this was at 12:23, so he was inside, walked out, and then he's gonna start a conversation with two people that are just wearing black, and... And then you see he continues. If he goes on for like three minutes, he just sort of walks down, and he engages in a conversation with those two girls, and they answer him. There's nothing here that seems to me to be controversial. When he hears them say something about "F you," it's before he has a conversation with them. It does happen. Take a listen. ^t-00-17-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1089" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-18-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Trying to isolate this audio for you guys. Those are the two girls he's talking about. Actually, I think one's a guy. You see where that came from? It was right here, wasn't it? It was like over here. Yeah. So he says, "Did you see where that came from?" It seems like a normal conversation. Kind of weird, for me, and there's a reason why I'm saying that: to hone in on these two individuals and to say, like, "gothic," and to pretend that they were doing something that looked abnormal—given the fact that in the longer video, everyone up top is quite calm.

So I wanted to get to the bottom, as I said earlier, of who that second person was in the photo with his nephew, cousin, whatever you want to call him. And we got just one hit. And it was, honestly, it was from Belfast, Northern Ireland, no less. Somebody sent us an email, and he said, "Look, I conducted an interview—an internet-wide search of the person's face." And I only got one hit using technology, and the hit was in Provo, Utah. And he wrote to me that it was quite a coincidence because not only is the person in Provo for this one hit for this face, but also he's featured on a website pertaining to bees. ^t-00-18-54

And my goodness, you guys, I almost jumped when I learned that that website he was referring to—Buzzards & Bees—is a gothic underground in Provo, okay? So this is the website. It's a gothic underground, of all things, in Provo: the website Buzzards & Bees. And they're speaking about a gothic prom. That is where that person's face comes up—except he's wearing makeup to make him look a little more gothic. Take a look at this. I'm going to show you the side-by-side of this individual, and I am certain— can't say a hundred percent, okay? ^t-00-19-40

The ears, the chin—just everything about this individual is a match. But he is as of yet unidentified as a goth—unidentified, pardon, as a gothic person. And he is also as of yet unidentified as the close friend of Shaner Broderick who cannot be found anywhere else, or people are not familiar with this person. So I'm thinking maybe he also came from overseas. Now quickly, regarding our question pertaining to Mike Mitchell, right? I was saying that it was pretty odd and obvious that they were trying to protect this Detective Mike Mitchell. ^t-00-20-22

And then we received some leads that I think have helped to clarify exactly what sort of a detective he was and maybe why he was not featured in a lot of articles—because he was, as it appears to be, an undercover detective. By all accounts, he was an online detective. Apparently, if this is the correct Mike Mitchell—and given the timeline of when he becomes an undercover detective, I have a strong hunch that it is the right individual, because he says, you know, he was on the force for 25 years. ^t-00-21-05

His job—Detective Mike Mitchell—was to create messages online to entrap pedophiles, okay, by pretending that he was underage. You guys know—you've heard about these sorts of stings. You pretend that you're underage as an officer and see people that try to hook up with you, and then you make an arrest. And so we can take a look at this article from November of 1999. It says, “Police surf Internet to snag pedophiles.” And it tells us, “Mike Mitchell sits at a desk tapping on a computer keyboard and becomes a boy. He's chatting with someone now. His words are full of typos and misspellings and childlike phrases. Mike Mitchell is not a boy. ^t-00-21-49

But the hunted doesn't know that. Mitchell, a detective with the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office, has been investigating child sex crimes on the Internet for about a year. ‘I don't think people realize how big it is,’ he tells them.” Okay, so that's interesting to me. Okay. And we can't then go, "Okay, let's make a jump here." Just because he's creating messages online—first and foremost—doesn't necessarily mean that he's the person that authored the fake messages. And I'm implying that. But I do actually think it was quite interesting because when we covered George Zinn—who was the decoy boy that day— who then we find out is into pedophilia, right? ^t-00-22-32

Absolutely despicable person. It really made us wonder— again, I said this on a previous episode—whether or not he had been blackmailed in some capacity to play the decoy boy and to give the shooter time to get away. I just find that to be interesting. A lot of stuff happening right now, guys, and we are definitively getting closer to what took place on that day. And we have a lot of leads that are coming in. And I want to say that I want to refocus your attention and now open this up internationally, because I have a hunch on who that goth kid is, okay? ^t-00-23-14

And yeah, that's what I want you to focus your attention on. Tips@candaceowens.com.

And before we do that, I first want to throw it to Riverbend Ranch because I've been speaking a lot about Riverbend Ranch. They have fantastic steaks—really the best that you will have. Black Angus beef that is actually famous for its great flavor. Riverbend Ranch has taken Black Angus beef to a whole new level over the last 35 years by creating an elite Angus herd. They use ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite Black Angus bulls containing special genetics to over 260 western U.S. ranches. ^t-00-24-38

And every fall the calves containing these elite genetics return to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in the lush mountain pastures. Now, when you purchase from Riverbend Ranch, you are not only supporting the 64 cowboys plus their families who work that ranch, but you're also supporting over 260 other U.S. ranches and the hundreds of American families who work on those ranches. It's born in the USA, raised in the USA, processed here in the USA. The meat is aged to perfection for 21 days, and it's shipped directly from the ranch to your home. This is not your average Black Angus beef. This is more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef that I've ever tasted. So right now, ^t-00-25-18

Okay, guys, so let's get into this. I mean, the attacks have not stopped. The attacks that are coming at me are good, though, because I am just feeling more and more energized by them. I understand exactly what is going on. The people fighting for Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) legacy. I got to say this. You know what? I am starting to think— and let me know if you think this is crazy—but I'm starting to think that the assassination of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was something akin to a regicide, right? The assassination of a king to install a new ruler who the king would have never approved of, right? ^t-00-27-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1689" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:28:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-28-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Maybe people around him counseling the king—people who perhaps betrayed him—because there are just too many things that I am finding out that are not adding up to me, okay? There are also—I do want to say this—too many first times leading up to this event, okay? One person who emailed me said, "Hey, I've been supplying bulletproof vests to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) for all of these campus tours." And suddenly, last semester—last spring, the last campus tour—they canceled. They canceled my contract with them. They did not want to renew. ^t-00-28-09

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1724" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:28:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-28-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** When I asked them why, they told me that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wanted to go a different direction by getting an army vest instead—like a metal army vest, I believe is what he says. And he said, "This made no sense." He didn't understand it. Okay, so Charlie (Charlie Kirk) decided—they decided—to use a new company—even though I don't think he was actually wearing a bullet vest on that day. So what happened there? I'm not sure. Something else that is really bothering me—just because I have done these campus tours—is the question of why Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was set to do two events in Utah, a mere 20 days apart, okay? ^t-00-28-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1765" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:29:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-29-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** He was supposed to do UVU, and then today was scheduled to do—just 20 days later—USU. Now, those two campuses are just under two hours apart if you're driving. Why on earth would he schedule these events apart? It's not how Turning Point USA normally decides on their events. If you're going to do two stops in one state, they make it happen back to back because it doesn't make sense from a fuel perspective, from a traveling perspective, for you to go in and out of one state. Plus, they only have a limited number of events, right? So they want to make sure they can go all over the United States and see as many students as possible during every tour. This is how it works. I know how it works because I came from Turning Point USA, okay? ^t-00-29-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1808" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:30:08</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-30-08.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I have toured with them every year—with the exception of this year—since I started working for Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So that just struck me as very odd, okay? We've also received—or maybe I should say maybe not odd, just something new, maybe— we've also received a lot of tips that the hospital that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was taken to is not the closest hospital. And it also would not have been the number-one-choice hospital for someone that was suffering from that sort of a wound. Like, it was a trauma III center. He was taken to a smaller regional hospital ^t-00-30-08

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1844" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:30:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-30-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** that was a little farther away—and was further away and was also less equipped for the trauma that he suffered—that he was taken to Timpanogos Regional Hospital. And also something new is that that hospital had just announced that they had a brand-new CEO and head surgeon named Andrew Zenger—a lot of new stuff happening. And to be clear, typically the states dictate the protocol, and you're required to—after you have a certain number of attendees at an event—you are required to have an ambulance on standby. And I don't know Utah state law, but I also found that weird—that there wouldn't have been an ambulance on standby. Again, correct me if I'm wrong, but seemed atypical to me. ^t-00-30-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=1888" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:31:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-31-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, in terms of other things that were new, they announced on that same day that Andrew Zenger was announced as a new CEO. That was also the day that they announced Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) tour. They announced five dates, and two of them were in Utah—dispersed throughout the month. It is also interesting to note that the Utah FBI also got a brand-new set of employees—the state FBI department. Kash Patel went ahead and fired not only the chief of the Utah bureau, but also some other people. You can see this in the Daily Mail article. They recount this after Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) death. “Kash Patel questions grow as it's revealed he gutted the Utah FBI leadership before Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination.” That is true. ^t-00-31-28

I think Robert Bowles—actually, it was his first week when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got shot—and he's somebody who has been in D.C. for decades. So it seems to me to be an unusual placement to then want to re-up your entire life—assuming you have a wife and kids—and move to Utah. But whatever. Again, everything just feels a little too brand new to me. Then I speak to the individual who I told you guys that I recognized and had taken down the cameras—minute—what was it?—minute four after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot. The back camera, of all the ones. When you take the front camera? I don't know. ^t-00-32-13

I've never seen that. He's never been behind me at an event. He's never been lingering around me at an event. And I asked about that. I asked about just his presence behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and plus the mysterious phone call that he was seen making in—like—minute three after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. And he... he told me explicitly that they were trying something new that day— like it was something new. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) super ambitious and, on the AV thing, they were trying something new, and they wanted to be able to feed it back instantly to Arizona. ^t-00-32-51

Okay, so let's stick with that theme. Do you want to know something else that was brand new leading up to this event? Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) perspective on Israel. Okay, so let me say this so you can hear it. Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) perspective on Israel was not starting to shift; it had shifted entirely, okay? There are no ifs, and there are no ands, and there are no buts about it. Israel knew that. Turning Point USA knew that—because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was explicit. ^t-00-33-36

You have the same people that are calling me anti-Semitic. You need to work with those people harder." And he was just putting it on paper. Was it an email? What was that that they were sharing on it? The New York Post, the Israeli Post, right? What were they sharing there? He wrote of his deep love for Israel. He had nothing else to do in May. Wrote of his deep love for Israel. It's a letter to Netanyahu. ^t-00-34-10

And we're supposed to believe—did he send that as an email, by the way? Can somebody clarify? Was that an email they were sharing? Or did he send it in the mail to him? Could somebody just share that, please? I'm assuming it was an email. Can someone share the timestamp on that? Just kind of, like, authenticate that email—because I'm very aware of what's going on, okay? And I don't know how the executives over at Turning Point USA sleep at night, okay? ^t-00-34-52

You tell the truth; that's it, okay? You don't hide it. You don't try to obfuscate it. You don't try to say, "Well, wait until the memorial event before we start looking into who murdered him." You tell the truth, and you tell it immediately. I don't think they're capable of doing that. And I have an idea as to why that is. I think the same people that were pressuring Charlie (Charlie Kirk) are pressuring them. In fact, I know that for a fact. So they might need my help. Okay. I'm going to state this, and I'm going to challenge Turning Point USA executives to issue a very clean statement saying that I am lying if this is not true. ^t-00-35-28

Did he also express that he wanted to bring me, Candace Owens, back because he was standing up for himself? And then did he—just 48 hours later—conveniently catch a bullet to the throat before our onstage reunion could happen? It's a yes or a no, okay? Let's stop this ditching.

I want to hear from Turning Point USA that I'm lying about that. I want you to say, "No, no, it was just, you know, he was feeling a little bit of pressure." No, I want you to literally answer what I have just said. It either happened or it didn't. I'm either making it all up, or it happened exactly as I'm saying. And while we're at it, may I ask, what is the name of the Jewish donor who sponsored the Hamptons weekend? Okay. And to Pastor Rob McCoy, were there any LLCs that you or your son were being paid through that sat outside of Turning Point? I'm asking that question genuinely. ^t-00-36-52

There is no way you are letting these lies fly unless—as I am hearing— unless it is true that there was a big, big, big payday that was on the line. ^t-00-37-35

Maybe they didn't want to take the chance. You see, I'm just one person. So it's easy to just try to cancel my life and lie on me every second of every day. ^t-00-38-04

So answer the questions, yes or no. And I'm going to—again—challenge you to lie. And if you do lie, I'm gonna expose the lies, and I'm gonna start dropping videos—actually. So that's where I'm at. Enough of the games, enough with trying to allow Israel to wrangle a narrative that you know is not true. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not die pro-Israel. He did not die for Israel. He did not martyr himself as a friend of Israel. In fact, the friends of Israel were pressuring him really badly, and he was done, and he finally stood up for himself. And I'm proud of that. And I will say this: you know what? Somewhere Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is watching, okay? And I hope he knows that we are reunited, okay? ^t-00-38-45

Extremely angry about it. But it feels good to know that, in the end, truth is going to win. So, accept my challenge or don't. Before I get to some of your comments, I'm gonna tell you about a couple more of our sponsors—Neemi Skincare being one of them. There is a reason that we all love the fall. Of course, it's the air, changing leaves. It's a season of transition, but that transition can also be tough on our skin. The end of summer sun, the new autumn wind—it can leave your skin looking tired, dry, and very dull. If you are looking in the mirror and you are feeling like your skin has lost its radiance with the season, then I should tell you about my absolute go-to, which is Neemi. You guys know I love Neemi. Neemi is the reason that my skin stays clear, firm, and glowing—no matter ^t-00-39-28

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA1FxrDWNIo&t=2409" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:40:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YA1FxrDWNIo/t-00-40-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** what the weather brings. Their three-step anti-aging routine is the perfect defense for this seasonal shift. It's packed with powerful, clinically-backed ingredients that work to restore your skin's barriers—which is exactly what you need to fight off that dry autumn air. It boosts collagen production to help with those fine lines. It locks in deep moisture, and it brightens your complexion—bringing back that healthy glow that you had in the summer. And here's what I love the most. Neemi is proudly American-made. In a world of skincare dominated by foreign brands, Neemi formulates and produces everything right here in the USA. World-class quality while staying true to the values that we hold dear—which is faith, family, and of course, freedom. Number one, freedom. And our faith and our family. You shouldn't have to compromise your values to get incredible skincare. And with Neemi, you don't have to. ^t-00-40-09

Get an exclusive 10% off your NeemiSkincare.com order. If you use code KANDICE10 at checkout, you can support a brand that supports this country, and you can see the results for yourself. Again, that's NeemiSkincare.com. Use promo code KANDICE10, and you'll get 10% off. The cost of everything is still out of control. I want to tell you about American Financing because many people are relying on credit cards to cover the essentials. If that debt is piling up, you are not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends in American Financing, but you may have hesitated because you didn't want to give up your low mortgage rate. Well, there's good news. ^t-00-40-53

Unlike a HELOC—which can have varied interest rates—the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment—giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing home mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started with no upfront or hidden fees. You can call American Financing, and you can start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210, or you can visit AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. Again, that's AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. All right, you guys, hope I've made myself clear. I'm done dancing. ^t-00-41-32

It's just unbelievable. It really is unbelievable. Do me a favor. Don't ever let anybody try to speak out who just tortured you your whole life and then pretend to say something nice. Please don't do that. Just call them out on being hideous individuals, you know? When you end up in a world where—like—a couple of days before Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) dies—someone like Laura Loomer is calling him anti-Semite, and she's funded by one of Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) donors, Bob Shillman—who then does a 180 and is now pretending that she is morally fighting me to stop researching into Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) murder—you know exactly what kind of world you live in. Politics sickens me. It really does. Everybody who has a little wish out there—"Oh, Candace (Candace Owens), like, jump into politics"— ^t-00-42-16

I hate everybody involved in politics. It is all about money, okay? They all sell their souls for money, and there are no real relationships, and I hope that you are learning that. If you're getting a lesson about that right now and it's not left or right—I think—which is something that I learned—it is not left or right; it is just individuals selling their souls. Comment from Rose. Rose writes, "No matter what videos I've seen from people on the left or right calling you crazy, I call it fake and gay. You have my full support. Truth is all that matters, and Christ is King." Yeah, here is the thing: people know truth when they hear it, okay? You know truth when you see it; you know when people are lying, and you can see the campaign. Now it's obvious, right? ^t-00-43-00

I've also got contracts—got contracts as well—how these people are getting paid: quote-unquote 501(c)(3)s, dedicating themselves to the fellowship of Christians and Jews. I mean, it is a really disturbing market, but you would think that following an assassination, that people would tether themselves to reality—that they would say, "I want to fight evil," and they would therefore commit themselves to truth. What I'm seeing right now is just stunning. It really is. I mean, I think his name online is An0maly. AJ tweeted, "Is this what happened after the JFK assassination?" ^t-00-43-43

Maybe—we weren't alive—maybe, AJ. Murphy writes, "I'm a progressive who disagrees with you on a lot, but as a fellow Catholic, I see the Holy Spirit working through you to find truth." "We are fighting a spiritual war against evil." "The left and the right must come together to fight authoritarianism." How to do that, by the way—I want to say to people at home: take your children out of these schools—all of them, okay? I cannot stress this enough. Homeschool your children. Make it work no matter what. Stop sending them to the universities, okay? ^t-00-44-25

It is a communist underground; it is real; it is 100% real; it is not imagined. And what they want—the one resource that these people want—are your children. Simple thing that you can do, okay? I know it takes a lot of adjustment. I'm waking up, and I'm homeschooling my kids. But by the way, it's the most rewarding thing in the world also. We just started this week, so it's only been for two days, but it's incredible how happy it makes me knowing that I am doing something to buck the trend as we are slipping further into authoritarian rule. Ashlyn Bigelow writes, "Advocating for a weekly Candace (Candace Owens) crash-out followed by 'I'd like to apologize for my tone 10 seconds ago.'" Yeah, I'm kind of—yeah, that's—I should do that. You're right. And I do; I should apologize for my tone. ^t-00-44-59

I'm trying to be more conscious, but I am— oh, man, I'm working on this anger. I'm working on just really appreciating how fake and gay it all is. Like, I'm just seeing these people just say, "Move on, move on from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." "It's good; we're gonna accept the narrative." "We're just gonna let the FBI do what the FBI does, and we're just gonna pretend these glaring, obvious lies and holes mean nothing and also work behind the scenes with the very people that were torturing Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." That is just not allowed. It's not allowed. Natalie writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), I am giddy AF watching you today." "You are on fire. To your audience, let's keep up the prayers, y'all." "Christ is King." Thank you so much, Natalie. I really appreciate that, and I appreciate all of your support. Marzi, thank you for your support. ^t-00-45-44

Oh, okay. I remember that you commented about that. Keyholing is if the bullet is too slow and tumbles and has external impact. The other is pinball bullets, where they bounce internally—causing internal damage to the target. So pinball bullets are the ones that cause internal damage. Very interesting. George writes, "We love you, Candy." "I pray the truth gets out soon." "Keep up the great work." The truth, George—it's inevitable. It is. It's not fun to be a liar because you got to squirm. And I appreciate the hand that they played here. I totally get the hand that they played here. They are lying. ^t-00-46-26

And the idea that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was pro-regime when he died ends today. That just ends today. HMMM writes, "Please stay safe." "If I buy a shirt, please don't do a Cardi B and call me out for my triple X sizes." By the way, we do have some new merch. You guys demanded this. We're also gonna make sure that you have the most appropriate kit on you. “We don't know, no, but we know” is the new Stanis cup that just dropped. It's pretty good. We don't know now, but we know. And we're about to know now—if you know what I mean, okay? So you can get your Stanis cup—available on CandaceOwens.com website. ^t-00-47-08

Somebody put in a request for a tank top. So we have that. Finally, getting you some kit. We'll drop more in the future, too. Yeah, because that's the vibe. That is the vibe. Go with your gut on things. And I loved that yesterday's episode—the number one comment—was that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) used to say that: like, "Go with your gut." There's something there. And I'm realizing more and more, guys, like we... we have a God intuition that is our gut. Your gut instinct is your God instinct. And we all know something's not right here. And the media has never worked harder to try to tell us, "No, no, no, no—just move along." And yeah, I proclaim regicide. Okay. And we are getting closer. So again, be very—I guess—careful—or mindful, rather, is a better word there. ^t-00-47-52

We are still working to identify our goth suspect. It's not the girl who is wearing black, but rather the person that was in the photos with nephew, cousin Broderick. And if you know something, please send us tips@candaceowens.com. We will have more for you tomorrow—some other stuff that I've been holding close to my chest about where we are hearing Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) wounds were. So I hate to leave you on a cliffhanger. I don't actually hate to leave you on a cliffhanger. It brings you back. And I love you guys. You guys keep us fighting. We'll see you tomorrow.
