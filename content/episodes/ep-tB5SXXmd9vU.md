I'm referring to me and <span id="ent-person-jean-michel-trogneux-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-trogneux.md">Jean-Michel Trogneux</a></span>, okay? <a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-trogneux.md">Jean-Michel Trogneux</a> has been so protected and has worn so many faces and has clearly gotten away with that across<span id="event-event-1979-01-01-egypt-israel-peace-treaty-facilitated-by-safari-cl-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-1979-01-01-egypt-israel-peace-treaty-facilitated-by-safari-cl.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> so many decades that you can almost understand the sheer arrogance. Imagine being so protected that you force multiple nation-states to collude to hide the obvious fact that you were born with a penis, right? That is real power. I am talking satanic power, though. And the antidote to Satan is always Christ. Truth will reign supreme in the end. So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. ^t-00-00-01

I have so many explosive revelations to share with you, and now it feels especially urgent, right? Don't you feel a sense of urgency right now? In the wake of me having learned that <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-00-57"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span> apparently paid for my assassination and that the <span id="ent-org-french-foreign-legion-t-00-00-57"><a href="/entities/org-french-foreign-legion.md">French Foreign Legion</a></span> was apparently involved and<span id="event-event-2025-08-20-french-foreign-legion-replaces-leadership-in-six-r-t-00-00-57"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-20-french-foreign-legion-replaces-leadership-in-six-r.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-08-02-french-foreign-legion-trains-with-us-marines-in-ca-t-00-00-57"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-02-french-foreign-legion-trains-with-us-marines-in-ca.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> on the ground at <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-00-57"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> on the day of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-57"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination.

I sat around and I said, "Hmm, I'm just not getting enough attention." How can I start a global conversation about me? And then I came up with this idea of creating fan fiction, where I imagined myself as the victim of a multinational<span id="event-event-2025-08-29-operation-bright-star-us-egypt-joint-military-exer-t-00-01-40"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-29-operation-bright-star-us-egypt-joint-military-exer.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> state plot to murder me. Yeah, if you thought that for a single second, that it was for funsies because I'm not busy or anything, then you're just not sober, you're not paying attention to anything, and you need to wake up real fast. We're gonna move quickly through a lot of things this week because everyone in the world needs to wake up to how things actually work. ^t-00-01-40

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU/t-00-02-25.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:25</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5SXXmd9vU&t=145" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** LOL to the idea of Western democracy, LOL to the idea that you can win in life and that everything's basically set the stage for a meritocracy and you can get ahead. No, actually, as you learn things, you become a target. You become a target to people that operate in the shadows. And that is, I think, what we are all learning in the wake of the last couple of months, especially. Now, going back to <span id="ent-date-november-25th-t-00-02-25"><a href="/entities/date-november-25th.md">November 25th</a></span>, I obviously tweeted exactly what I was informed, okay? I'm going to read that tweet to you in its entirety. Urgent. Two days ago, I was contacted by a high-ranking employee of the <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-02-25"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> government. ^t-00-02-25

In short, this person claims the <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-03-07"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Macrons</a></span> have executed upon and paid for my assassination. Yes, you read that correctly. More specifically, that the green light was given to a small team<span id="event-event-2025-09-04-brigitte-macron-photographed-with-zelenskyy-during-t-00-03-07"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-04-brigitte-macron-photographed-with-zelenskyy-during.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-04-brigitte-macron-opens-paris-design-week-t-00-03-07"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-04-brigitte-macron-opens-paris-design-week.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> in the <span id="ent-org-national-gendarmerie-intervention-group-t-00-03-07"><a href="/entities/org-national-gendarmerie-intervention-group.md">National Gendarmerie Intervention Group</a></span>. I am told there is one <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-03-07"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israeli</a></span> that is on the assassination squad and that plans were formalized. Again, this person provided concrete proof that they are well placed within the <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a> government apparatus. ^t-00-03-07

Journalist <span id="ent-person-xavier-poussard-t-00-03-45"><a href="/entities/person-xavier-poussard.md">Xavier Poussard</a></span>'s life is also at risk. This is deadly serious. The head of state of <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-03-45"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span> apparently wants us both dead and has authorized professional units to carry this out. I ask that every person retweet and share this. I do not know who in the American government can be trusted since this source claims that our leaders are aware. But I have more specific information which is definitively verifiable, should they care to reach out to me and to the brave official in <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a> who did this because they were so moved by the evil of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s public execution to risk their own life. May God bless you truly. Let all be revealed. ^t-00-03-45

I said there was a paper trail that Macron allegedly paid $1.5 million. And I am saying allegedly because until I can physically see with my own eyes inside of these accounts and verify the transfer of that payment, it's of course alleged. The amount is alleged. Two assassins were hired, one <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-04-29"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israeli</a></span>, one <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-04-29"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span>-Canadian woman, okay, a man and a woman. And I also said that the money ran through the elite gentlemen's club des Saints.

Okay, I don't follow military stuff. So me even mentioning specific gendarmerie, you have to assume that I got this information from somebody. Thank you. Now, if you are, in fact, currently at this moment, the first man of <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-05-08"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span>, that would be <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-05-08"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a></span>, and you are currently suing a podcaster in <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-05-08"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span> named <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-05-08"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> for defamation, for telling the truth, right? And the story that you are trying to sell to the public is that you were really, deep down in your heart, ^t-00-05-08

Then <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> publicly proclaiming and accusing you of something akin to, not akin to, directly implicated in her assassination, a claim which has gone viral. When I say viral, I mean, just the tweet alone had over 100,000 retweets and 45 million impressions on X alone, okay? This would be your unique opportunity as the <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-05-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> first man to prove your case about <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> to the public, right? In the court of public opinion, this would be your time to slam dunk. ^t-00-05-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU/t-00-06-34.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:34</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5SXXmd9vU&t=394" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Remember, the <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-06-34"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> couple has been so psychotically obsessed with trying to paint me as conflicted in my reporting that they even hired a private investigator to try to see if I was colluding with other state actors, you know, they kind of gloriously insinuated that I might be working with <span id="ent-gpe-russia-t-00-06-34"><a href="/entities/gpe-russia.md">Russia</a></span>. They paid for that. They paid for that investigation. So using that logic, wouldn't this be the opportunity, if you're the <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a> couple, to come out and to prove your point, to make a stunning and a swift statement, right? We are shocked by the accusation. Of course, never in a million years. Oh, we told you guys, this is just for clicks, it's for money. ^t-00-06-34

I hope <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-07-18"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> gets well soon. That would be what I would say you should do if I'm advising you from a PR standpoint, right? In American basketball terms, this is like a flagrant foul and you now get some free throws, right? If you're the <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-07-18"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> couple. You're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, investigative fees, and PR fees in a country on the other side of the Atlantic trying desperately to paint me as a lunatic. And I give you the opportunity to spike the ball, to prove that I'm a lunatic, and you don't do it. No, they didn't do it, did they? If you're paying attention, they did not do it. ^t-00-07-18

But what did the <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-08-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> couple do? That's what matters. It's now been a full week since I made that announcement.

Press the <span id="ent-org-white-house-t-00-08-40"><a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a></span> for a response, right? The <a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a> is the ball's very firmly in their court.

Did I report it to the <a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a>? Of course I reported it to the <a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a>. Did I report it to the FBI?

The whole world is invested in that assassination. Wouldn't you want to shut that down? The idea that it was a multi-nationally planned event. And by the way, is that on its face even plausible?

When our cells do not have enough of C15, they become fragile and they age faster. Thankfully, Fatty15 repairs age-related damage to cells, protects them from future breakdown, and activates pathways in the body that help regulate our sleep, our cognitive health, and natural repair mechanisms. Fatty15 is science-backed, it's award-winning, it's patented, 100% pure C15 supplement. It's free of flavors, allergens, preservatives, and it's also vegan-friendly. Fatty15 has three times more cellular benefits than Omega-3 or fish oil. It comes in gorgeous reusable glass bamboo jars, and refills are shipped directly to your front door. ^t-00-42-44

The first thing I'd like to clarify is I have never been friends with <span id="ent-person-steven-crowder-t-00-48-53"><a href="/entities/person-steven-crowder.md">Steven Crowder</a></span>. I just feel like that is a really not-good dirt to throw on my name. I just have better intuition than that. Secondly, my friend <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-48-53"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Kirk</a></span> just got shot in the neck, hence the reason we're doing this entire podcast investigation into what actually happened on that day. Now, you seem to be naming employers. Regarding <span id="ent-org-the-daily-wire-t-00-48-53"><a href="/entities/org-the-daily-wire.md">The Daily Wire</a></span>, I am still friends with every single one of my colleagues that I was friends with when I went in there. And yeah, when you leave a job, you don't tend to hang out with management on your way out. So I'm not sure what you're referencing here. ^t-00-48-53

Because I'm a person who grew up on <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-49-28"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a></span>'s music, and it's so funny that I was blasting his early music. One of his first songs, "<span id="ent-work-all-falls-down-t-00-49-28"><a href="/entities/work-all-falls-down.md">All Falls Down</a></span>," and he speaks about this. This is how they create <span id="ent-work-the-matrix-t-00-49-28"><a href="/entities/work-the-matrix.md">the matrix</a></span>. Insecure men speak like that, okay? They want people who are insecure to allow terrible things to happen because they say, well, you can hang out with me. You can hang out. All you have to do is just not talk about the <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-49-28"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Epstein</a></span> files, and you might get invited to <span id="ent-org-mar-a-lago-t-00-49-28"><a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a></span>. Don't you want to be invited to <a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a>? Don't you want to go to <a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a>?

This is that mentality, okay? It's disgusting, it's gross, but more importantly, it is insecure. So I wanna remind you guys that your real friends do not need to be famous, okay? My best friends are not famous, and you should be close with your family. You should have real value in your life. Part of <span id="ent-work-the-matrix-t-00-50-13"><a href="/entities/work-the-matrix.md">the matrix</a></span> requires you to have this sort of instinct to think celebrities are cool and that they glitter and they're golden.

After that episode, <a href="/entities/person-eric-bolling.md">Eric Bolling</a> sent me an email and apologized and said it was Adam's fault. He didn't even know Adam's name.

That's the reality of the political fields. Get real value in your life. And that's what I want to say about that before I get into some of your questions. Poll is still running, by the way. I will tell you the total when we come back from this brief break. All right, you guys, I want to remind you about <span id="ent-org-puretalk-t-00-51-40"><a href="/entities/org-puretalk.md">PureTalk</a></span>.

Right now through December 7th, you can get all of this for just $29.95 a month. You're saving over 50% a month, every month, for life, and it's all on their crazy fast 5G network.

Well, that's possible. You call <span id="ent-org-american-financing-t-00-53-05"><a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a></span> today, you're feeling stretched by everyday expenses, groceries, gas, and bills that are piling up. You are not alone. Most Americans are putting these expenses on credit cards, and credit card rates are insane in the 20s or even 30s right now. Well, <a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a> can show you how to use your home's equity to pay off that debt with rates in the low fives. Their salary-based mortgage consultants are helping homeowners just like you restructure their loans and save money every month, all without any upfront fees.

Like I said to you from the beginning, I never had for a single second the sense that they were going to get away with it this time. I felt the <span id="ent-concept-devil-t-00-59-13"><a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a></span> had overplayed his hand, and that is the circumstance we are seeing. I think <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-59-13"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a></span> overplayed his hand. I think <span id="ent-person-jean-michel-trogneux-t-00-59-13"><a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-trogneux.md">Jean-Michel Trogneux</a></span>, the evidence is pointing to the fact that he is from a very powerful old family. That's pretty obvious to me. ^t-00-59-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU/t-00-59-56.md" class="timestamp-link">00:59:56</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5SXXmd9vU&t=3596" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The entire Trogneux backstory makes entirely no sense, saying that they were chocolatiers and things were never interrupted. They just ran this chocolatier factory from, like, the 1880s all the way through to now—not possible. Nazis did an aerial bombardment. They occupied the city of <span id="ent-gpe-amiens-t-00-59-56"><a href="/entities/gpe-amiens.md">Amiens</a></span>. This seems to me to be an identity that was just created and materialized for this family and that the true family is a very powerful family, and that is why they are so obsessed with protecting this absurd state secret. The whole world knows this is a dude. What are we doing here? ^t-00-59-56

Why did <a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-trogneux.md">Jean-Michel</a> have to transition, quote-unquote transition, into a woman? What was <span id="ent-person-jean-michel-trogneux-t-01-00-34"><a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-trogneux.md">Jean-Michel Trogneux</a></span> involved in that required that transition? These are now the questions that I'm asking myself. And you know what? If <span id="ent-org-the-federal-government-t-01-00-34"><a href="/entities/org-the-federal-government.md">the federal government</a></span> is going to bankrupt us for telling the truth, then I'm going to have to be the example for the world to wake up to that, okay? Then even this lawsuit, in a weird way, is blessed because it is exposing every layer of corruption that exists, that even when you do things the right way your entire life, ^t-01-00-34

That feels like a very important lesson for the entire world to wake up to. And I think the entire world is waking up to that right now. So you know what? Joke's on you.
