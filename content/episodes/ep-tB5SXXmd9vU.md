I have so many explosive revelations to share with you, and now it feels especially urgent, right?

I sat around and I said, "Hmm, I'm just not getting enough attention." How can I start a global conversation about me?

Yeah, if you thought that for a single second, that it was for funsies because I'm not busy or anything, then you're just not sober, you're not paying attention to anything, and you need to wake up real fast. We're gonna move quickly through a lot of things this week because everyone in the world needs to wake up to how things actually work. ^t-00-01-40

No, actually, as you learn things, you become a target. You become a target to people that operate in the shadows. And that is, I think, what we are all learning in the wake of the last couple of months, especially. Now, going back to <span id="ent-date-november-25th-t-00-02-25"><a href="/entities/date-november-25th.md">November 25th</a></span>, I obviously tweeted exactly what I was informed, okay?

The head of state of <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-03-45"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span> apparently wants us both dead and has authorized professional units to carry this out. I ask that every person retweet and share this. I do not know who in the American government can be trusted since this source claims that our leaders are aware. But I have more specific information which is definitively verifiable, should they care to reach out to me and to the brave official in <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a> who did this because they were so moved by the evil of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s public execution to risk their own life.

Okay, I don't follow military stuff. So me even mentioning specific gendarmerie, you have to assume that I got this information from somebody. Thank you. Now, if you are, in fact, currently at this moment, the first man of <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-05-08"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span>, that would be <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-05-08"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a></span>, and you are currently suing a podcaster in America named <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-05-08"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> for defamation, for telling the truth, right?

Then <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> publicly proclaiming and accusing you of something akin to, not akin to, directly implicated in her assassination, a claim which has gone viral. When I say viral, I mean, just the tweet alone had over 100,000 retweets and 45 million impressions on X alone, okay? This would be your unique opportunity as the French first man to prove your case about <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> to the public, right? In the court of public opinion, this would be your time to slam dunk. ^t-00-05-51

They paid for that. They paid for that investigation. So using that logic, wouldn't this be the opportunity, if you're the French couple, to come out and to prove your point, to make a stunning and a swift statement, right? We are shocked by the accusation. Of course, never in a million years. Oh, we told you guys, this is just for clicks, it's for money. ^t-00-06-34

I hope <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-07-18"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> gets well soon. That would be what I would say you should do if I'm advising you from a PR standpoint, right? In American basketball terms, this is like a flagrant foul and you now get some free throws, right? If you're the French couple. You're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees, investigative fees, and PR fees in a country on the other side of the Atlantic trying desperately to paint me as a lunatic. And I give you the opportunity to spike the ball, to prove that I'm a lunatic, and you don't do it. No, they didn't do it, did they? If you're paying attention, they did not do it. ^t-00-07-18

When our cells do not have enough of C15, they become fragile and they age faster. Thankfully, Fatty15 repairs age-related damage to cells, protects them from future breakdown, and activates pathways in the body that help regulate our sleep, our cognitive health, and natural repair mechanisms. Fatty15 is science-backed, it's award-winning, it's patented, 100% pure C15 supplement. It's free of flavors, allergens, preservatives, and it's also vegan-friendly. Fatty15 has three times more cellular benefits than Omega-3 or fish oil. It comes in gorgeous reusable glass bamboo jars, and refills are shipped directly to your front door. ^t-00-42-44

The first thing I'd like to clarify is I have never been friends with <span id="ent-person-steven-crowder-t-00-48-53"><a href="/entities/person-steven-crowder.md">Steven Crowder</a></span>. I just feel like that is a really not-good dirt to throw on my name. I just have better intuition than that. <span id="claim-claim-0f315d66c71a-t-00-48-53">Secondly, my friend <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-48-53"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Kirk</a></span> just got shot in the neck, hence the reason we're doing this entire podcast investigation into what actually happened on that day<a href="/claims/claim-0f315d66c71a.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. Now, you seem to be naming employers. Regarding <span id="ent-org-the-daily-wire-t-00-48-53"><a href="/entities/org-the-daily-wire.md">The Daily Wire</a></span>, I am still friends with every single one of my colleagues that I was friends with when I went in there. And yeah, when you leave a job, you don't tend to hang out with management on your way out. So I'm not sure what you're referencing here. ^t-00-48-53

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU/t-00-49-28.md" class="timestamp-link">00:49:28</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5SXXmd9vU&t=2968" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** If you mean that I am not one of those basic bitches who needs to post every second of when I'm hanging out with people so that people think that I'm cool and I'm surrounded by individuals, you would be right. Because I'm a person who grew up on <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-49-28"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a></span>'s music, and it's so funny that I was blasting his early music. One of his first songs, "<span id="ent-work-all-falls-down-t-00-49-28"><a href="/entities/work-all-falls-down.md">All Falls Down</a></span>," and he speaks about this. This is how they create the matrix. Insecure men speak like that, okay? They want people who are insecure to allow terrible things to happen because they say, well, you can hang out with me. You can hang out. All you have to do is just not talk about the <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-49-28"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Epstein</a></span> files, and you might get invited to <span id="ent-org-mar-a-lago-t-00-49-28"><a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a></span>. Don't you want to be invited to <a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a>? Don't you want to go to <a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a>? Then why don't you look away when we talk about children being abused? ^t-00-49-28

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU/t-00-50-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:50:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5SXXmd9vU&t=3013" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It's so weird. Like, don't you wanna have, like, really all of the invites to <span id="ent-org-mar-a-lago-t-00-50-13"><a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a></span> and you can hang out and get dressed up and hang out with cool people in <span id="ent-gpe-hollywood-t-00-50-13"><a href="/entities/gpe-hollywood.md">Hollywood</a></span> if you just look the other way when children are being abused? This is that mentality, okay? It's disgusting, it's gross, but more importantly, it is insecure. So I wanna remind you guys that your real friends do not need to be famous, okay? My best friends are not famous, and you should be close with your family. You should have real value in your life. Part of the matrix requires you to have this sort of instinct to think celebrities are cool and that they glitter and they're golden. The majority of them are pretty effed up and drunk. That's the reality. ^t-00-50-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU/t-00-50-56.md" class="timestamp-link">00:50:56</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5SXXmd9vU&t=3056" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** No, and by the way, on the subject of who the kind of people that he's referring to, it was notoriously <span id="ent-person-eric-bolling-t-00-50-56"><a href="/entities/person-eric-bolling.md">Eric Bolling</a></span> that sat across from Adam when they attacked me over <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-50-56"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Kirk</a></span> and lied and said that I hadn't been friends with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Kirk</a> since <span id="ent-date-2017-t-00-50-56"><a href="/entities/date-2017.md">2017</a></span>. After that episode, <a href="/entities/person-eric-bolling.md">Eric Bolling</a> sent me an email and apologized and said it was Adam's fault. He didn't even know Adam's name. I think he called him Sam in the email. I should actually pull it and I'll post it on <span id="ent-org-instagram-t-00-50-56"><a href="/entities/org-instagram.md">Instagram</a></span>—didn't even know—threw Adam's and PBD's entire team under the bus in three seconds, and said, I just want to apologize with you, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-50-56"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, because that's how politics work. They all stab each other in the back, and they all do it because they think they're on the pursuit of, like, fame and riches. ^t-00-50-56

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU/t-00-51-40.md" class="timestamp-link">00:51:40</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5SXXmd9vU&t=3100" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** We are not going to save the West in general from the absolute sexual deviants that run it, the liars and the crooks that run the West, if we have the attitude that we need to be well liked by famous people who are all drunk, truly, they're all just a bunch of drunks hanging out in DC. That's the reality of the political fields. Get real value in your life. And that's what I want to say about that before I get into some of your questions. Poll is still running, by the way. I will tell you the total when we come back from this brief break. All right, you guys, I want to remind you about PureTalk. In all the time that I have been endorsing my wireless company, PureTalk, I've never seen an offer like this. Right now you can get unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited data with a 30 gig hotspot for just $29.95 a month for life. ^t-00-51-40

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU/t-00-52-25.md" class="timestamp-link">00:52:25</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5SXXmd9vU&t=3145" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** This is PureTalk's top tier plan, which is normally $65 a month. Right now through December 7th, you can get all of this for just $29.95 a month. You're saving over 50% a month, every month, for life, and it's all on their crazy fast 5G network. But this offer is extremely short-lived, of course, so do not wait. Go to puretalk.com/Owens for PureTalk's best unlimited plan for just $29.95 a month for life. Make the switch in as little as 10 minutes. You can keep your phone, keep your number, and you can start saving with their unlimited plan for life. Again, that's puretalk.com/ Owens to switch to my wireless company, which is PureTalk. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing, because what if you could delay your next two mortgage payments? ^t-00-52-25

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU/t-00-53-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:53:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB5SXXmd9vU&t=3185" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I mean, you can imagine putting those two payments in your pocket and finally getting a little bit of breathing room ahead of the holidays. Well, that's possible. You call American Financing today, you're feeling stretched by everyday expenses, groceries, gas, and bills that are piling up. You are not alone. Most Americans are putting these expenses on credit cards, and credit card rates are insane in the 20s or even 30s right now. Well, American Financing can show you how to use your home's equity to pay off that debt with rates in the low fives. Their salary-based mortgage consultants are helping homeowners just like you restructure their loans and save money every month, all without any upfront fees. Their customers are saving an average of $800 a month, which is like a $10,000 raise without having to change jobs. So, call American Financing today at 800-795-1210. ^t-00-53-05

Or visit AmericanFinancing.net/Owens, AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. Okay, we actually are going to pull that email because you know how the internet is. If I don't post a receipt, they'll say it never happened. So we're going to pull that email that <span id="ent-person-eric-bolling-t-00-53-46"><a href="/entities/person-eric-bolling.md">Eric Bolling</a></span> sent about Adam because it really demonstrates the fickleness of politics. First, getting to the poll, I asked you, with all that information, do you believe <span id="ent-org-the-federal-government-t-00-53-46"><a href="/entities/org-the-federal-government.md">the federal government</a></span> worked behind the scenes to try to bankrupt me over <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-53-46"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a></span>, which is something that I had never considered until now and learning about what goes on in this corner of <span id="ent-gpe-wilmington-t-00-53-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-53-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span>. 24,856 people voted. ^t-00-53-46

Okay, just making sure that you're all having the same gut instinct as me of why the heck did they sue in <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-54-28"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span>? What is this never-before-seen lawsuit? It is a consequence from <span id="ent-work-the-matrix-t-00-54-28"><a href="/entities/work-the-matrix.md">The Matrix</a></span> for me discussing a multinational state secret, which is <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-54-28"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a></span>. <span id="claim-claim-7c8e6c281b92-t-00-54-28"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a>'s true origins, what <a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a> was involved in in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-54-28"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">United States</a></span> while living as <span id="ent-person-jean-michel-trogneux-t-00-54-28"><a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-trogneux.md">Jean-Michel Trogneux</a></span><a href="/claims/claim-7c8e6c281b92.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. And by the way, I think there's another identity in between there that happens potentially in the 80s for <a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a>, before he emerges as a woman. And I think it's quite dark, whatever that secret is, to be honest with you. ^t-00-54-28

Anyways, getting into the top comment from the last episode—and Skylar, just let me know when you have that email ready. This was: "How did" from knit unravel wrote, "How did <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-55-11"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span> know that it was supposed to be Candace if the killer is <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-55-11"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>?"

What list? Nobody mentioned that <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> had a list. And certainly, if he's killing over the topic of <span id="ent-concept-transgenderism-t-00-55-11"><a href="/entities/concept-transgenderism.md">transgenderism</a></span>, I don't think me and <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> would be high on it.

What was that list that was happening behind the scenes? It's almost like <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-55-54"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> and I were being threatened from the <span id="ent-org-united-states-military-t-00-55-54"><a href="/entities/org-united-states-military.md">United States military</a></span>.

If she wants to talk, I'll call her. If not, no worries. I've lost too many people in my life to get too emotional about these things. I've always respected CO. That moment got blown out of proportion. Anyway, I remain." And my message back was, keep that same energy. <span id="claim-claim-383d2cd8bb1f-t-00-56-36">You went onto a podcast, you lied about a relationship with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-56-36"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> right after he died<a href="/claims/claim-383d2cd8bb1f.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>.

And you're just gonna privately email this little sucker apology. Keep the same energy. Do it publicly. Say I lied or I misspoke, whichever it is. He's not done that. He's not moved to do that.

Anyways, I think we are just so over time that I don't know that we're going to have too much space here for comments, and we have so much to cover this week. I'll read a couple of these. <span id="ent-person-mickey-shaw-t-00-57-16"><a href="/entities/person-mickey-shaw.md">Mickey Shaw</a></span> writes, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood.
