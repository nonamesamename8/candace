**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-00-00.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=0" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** All right, you guys. Well, if Halloween is your thing, then I definitely have a scary story for you. And it's scary because it's not fiction, okay? This is real life: the assassination of my friend, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. We are now, I believe, extremely close to solving this thing. I think after this episode, you are going to recognize that there is just irrefutable proof that there were in fact foreign actors involved. And of course, that implies that our government knows. Our government absolutely knows. We already felt that way. So let's jump right back into this impromptu episode. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-00-49.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:49</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=49" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, I want to preface this by letting you guys know that I am positively exhausted. I have been up all night realizing what we were suddenly on the brink of. I stumbled into it. I wouldn't even say accidentally. Obviously, this has been on my mind since we all watched <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-49"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> be executed in front of the world, and then a lot of people lied about it—and a lot of people who were not acting right or grieving right, who were his closest comrades and business partners. And let's be frank: as I get an inch closer and closer to discovering the truth, we should recognize that this is pretty dangerous stuff. ^t-00-00-49

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-01-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=82" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And my theory now—I feel confident stating—that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-22"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was taken out by something much bigger than the <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-01-22"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> organization that he was running, and certainly much bigger than <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-01-22"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> on the LDS rooftop, who I don't even think set foot on the campus that day. And I think another thing that I should mention is just how positively sad it is. We can reflect on how sad it is already that there are so many people in the world who are convinced they've emailed me. I mean, I've received an unbelievable amount of emails from people that are convinced that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) actually still alive, right? ^t-00-01-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-02-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=125" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And it's not sad because those people are crazy. They're actually reacting to the lack of emotion and the lack of drive that is coming out of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-05"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> to figure out who killed him. That's what they're reacting to. So, like, they came to—okay—this is so unnatural—the reaction of these individuals who were so close to him— that the more logical, sensible conclusion is that they actually know where <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> is and he's perfectly alive. Yeah, that is how absurd they are acting. Just move on. Just donate to <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a>. This is what <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> would want. And that's his legacy. So what happened? Why are we here? Why are we live on Friday? I gave up Fridays, but this is so relevant to what's happening. ^t-00-02-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-02-47.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:47</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=167" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I want to get this information out so that everyone in the world who has been helping me investigate could have the weekend to do research, and we can information share. The answer to the centralized intelligence agency, as we have said, is <span id="ent-org-decentralized-intelligence-agency-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/org-decentralized-intelligence-agency.md">the decentralized intelligence agency</a></span>. We must decentralize ourselves to plug out of this utterly demonic system. Anyway, what happened yesterday was obviously I did the show, and I circled back to the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> military plane. I had simply tweeted about it while I was in <span id="ent-gpe-wyoming-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a></span>, obviously recognizing that it was not normal that this <a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a> military plane had departed on the morning of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) assassination. Now I made the mistake of thinking it had departed in the afternoon, ^t-00-02-47

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-03-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=206" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** and the reaction to it—this is how you always know the giveaway—is they overreact to something, and then the military bots make it a trending story. Like, there's no way this was trending. This guy correcting me on the timing—he tweets it, and the next thing you know it's trending: "<span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-03-26"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> plane debunked." It was not debunked. I showed you that yesterday. Okay. Thanks to a very brave person—a foreigner, actually—who informed me that the people who came in on that plane were not the people that went out on that plane. So where did they go? They were estimating like approximately 18 people were on the plane that came over, and far less were on the way back. Where did these people go? Well, let me tell you something. ^t-00-03-26

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-04-11.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=251" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** As you know, because I am relying on you guys for tips—I'm grateful that I have a platform, but I don't exist without you guys— I'm always checking the comments to see if I got something wrong, if I made a mistake, if there's something that I missed. And somebody I just happened to catch gave a live comment right after the show. I was looking at your comments, and he said, "Oh, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-04-11"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, that plane we covered, the tail number <span id="ent-vehicle-su-btt-t-00-04-11"><a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">SUBTT</a></span>—just so you know—like a year earlier, that plane was in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-04-11"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> at the same time as <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-11"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>." In <span id="ent-date-2023-t-00-04-11"><a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a></span>, I was like, "Oh, that's pretty ironic if that's true." I was like, it's probably not true—except it actually was true. ^t-00-04-11

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-04-51.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:51</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=291" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I started last night, and I said, "Okay, maybe that was a coincidence. Let me actually—since I presented that timeline for you every time I came to <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-04-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>—see if it was always near <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-51"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, or if it was always near some big <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> event, if something was going on with <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a>." And the answer, you guys—if you thought once was maybe, twice was a coincidence, three times we have a conspiracy—we're at about every single time that we could go back on this plane, and we're not done, obviously. There was something happening at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-04-51"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> that was neighboring, okay—in the same city. So I'm gonna take you through this timeline. This is so shocking to me. And I've color-coordinated this timeline. I'm sure there are going to be some errors. ^t-00-04-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-05-35.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=335" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Pick them up, <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-05-35"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span>. Go hard. Make a trend. For the rest of us, let me know if there's slight adjustments that need to be made. But I think we've done a pretty thorough job. So I'm gonna let you know what you are looking at, okay? Tail number—there's two actually <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-05-35"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> planes—because then somebody else mentioned to me, "Hey, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-05-35"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, there was another <a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a> plane that left three hours after—<a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a> military plane that is—three hours after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-35"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was assassinated from <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-05-35"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-05-35"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>." And that tail number is <span id="ent-vehicle-su-bnd-t-00-05-35"><a href="/entities/vehicle-su-bnd.md">SUBND</a></span>. And you should take a look at that. And I thought to myself, "Okay, I'll take a look at that. Maybe that's where the rest of the passengers went. ^t-00-05-35

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-06-10.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:10</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=370" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Maybe that emptied <span id="ent-vehicle-su-btt-t-00-06-10"><a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">SUBTT</a></span> left in the morning, and three hours after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was assassinated—or maybe it's the next day. I'm sorry. Marcus corrected me in my ear: three days after <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was assassinated—that's when the rest of the passengers left. So we have two tail numbers, and they're gonna be color-coordinated to make it really easy for you, okay? Tail number <span id="ent-vehicle-su-bnd-t-00-06-10"><a href="/entities/vehicle-su-bnd.md">SUBND</a></span>. That's a Gulfstream 4. It's about 12 to 16 passengers. And tail number <a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">SUBTT</a>. That's gonna be our main one. That's our Falcon 7X. Again, holds about 12 to 16 passengers. ^t-00-06-10

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-06-48.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:48</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=408" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, for those of you who are not jumping around, flying on private jets all the time, the tail number—essentially—is like the best way to think of it—like a public plane. We'll say American Airlines on it, right? In order for systems to know how planes are moving in the sky, they kind of have to give them a license plate in the sky, so to speak, right? So the tail number is a unique license plate that literally is called the tail number because it's on the tail of the plane, okay? We're going to start with—and I'm going to show you this. I'm showing you this just because <span id="ent-date-2022-t-00-06-48"><a href="/entities/date-2022.md">2022</a></span>—as you can see, I haven't made any notes on this because I haven't gotten back that far. But these are the four times that <span id="ent-vehicle-su-btt-t-00-06-48"><a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">BTT</a></span>—so they're both SU—that <a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">BTT</a> was here in <a href="/entities/date-2022.md">2022</a>. ^t-00-06-48

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-07-32.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:32</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=452" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That's the furthest that we can go back on <span id="ent-org-flightradar-t-00-07-32"><a href="/entities/org-flightradar.md">FlightRadar</a></span>. Now we're going to go into <span id="ent-date-2023-t-00-07-32"><a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a></span>. And I have included notes that I think might be relevant to the story. So in <a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a>, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-32"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>—I went back on his X feed—and he is hitting hard on <span id="ent-gpe-ukraine-t-00-07-32"><a href="/entities/gpe-ukraine.md">Ukraine</a></span>. I mean, like, he's tweeting out photos of <span id="ent-person-volodymyr-zelensky-t-00-07-32"><a href="/entities/person-volodymyr-zelensky.md">Zelensky</a></span> half-naked 'cause you know, he used to be an actor. Obviously he's a homosexual male. He's basically demanding—keep this up the whole time, guys. I want them to be able to look through this. He's basically demanding that we pull out of the <a href="/entities/gpe-ukraine.md">Ukrainian</a> war. He's accusing <a href="/entities/gpe-ukraine.md">Ukraine</a> and <a href="/entities/person-volodymyr-zelensky.md">Zelensky</a> of corruption, of financial fraud, of money laundering. ^t-00-07-32

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-08-14.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:14</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=494" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** You go back, and he's just basically declared war on the <a href="/entities/gpe-ukraine.md">Ukrainian</a> war—figuratively speaking, okay? And he's not siding on Team <span id="ent-gpe-ukraine-t-00-08-14"><a href="/entities/gpe-ukraine.md">Ukraine</a></span>. He's not pro-<span id="ent-gpe-russia-t-00-08-14"><a href="/entities/gpe-russia.md">Russia</a></span>, but he's not... I think that's relevant, obviously, because—yeah—when you talk about money laundering around <a href="/entities/gpe-ukraine.md">Ukraine</a> and Romania, you're actually stepping on the heels of <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-08-14"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>, right? That's not something that you can just say when you run this pro-American organization, given the fact that these people run our government.

So this is—I haven't done a deep dive on him by any means—but I was like, I recognize that name. And I recognize that name because many people emailed us after <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-11-02"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) assassination, and they thought <a href="/entities/person-sean-feucht.md">Sean Feucht</a> was the guy that was standing and cheering "<span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-11-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>! <a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a>!" And I think he did a video and denied it. But that's the only familiarity—like the only way that I was familiar with that name. So look him up on his biography. And it tells us that he was born in <span id="ent-gpe-montana-t-00-11-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-montana.md">Montana</a></span>. He's a son of a dermatologist. That dermatologist is not named.

I did not know them, so this has to be the year that they got super involved because I'm gonna do my last speech for them in June of <a href="/entities/date-2024.md">2024</a>. Anyways, he gets promoted to chief of staff. And then on February 8th, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-19-41"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) campus tour is publicly announced.

Because I can't find that. I've looked through. I've tried to see who was the first person. Typically, I think to start a charter chapter, you have to apply, so there's got to be some students.

He's misrepresented his ministry activities. Ceaseless financial solicitation, they accuse him of—intermingled with grand visions—which has led to untold financial gain and a steady stream of unpaid labor from volunteers. Starting to sound a little bit familiar here. And they make statements that he was purportedly using—and I'm going to say this allegedly; I'm reading this from the article—using business credit cards for personal expenses. He diverted donations to personal accounts. He inflated the prices that were paid to vendors. ^t-00-26-47

We then know that three days later—bringing that back up—on September 13th, our blue plane—which trails—is going to leave through <span id="ent-gpe-canada-t-00-40-17"><a href="/entities/gpe-canada.md">Canada</a></span>, as it always does. It's going to leave <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-40-17"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>.

Did that plane perhaps have the rest of the people that were left behind? What is going on? I wanna know. One more thing that I want to mention to you—and <span id="ent-person-skylar-t-00-40-17"><a href="/entities/person-skylar.md">Skylar</a></span>, I actually didn't tell you. ^t-00-40-17

Okay, under the notes from me—<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-41-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>—because this is stuff that we're working on. I mean, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>—goodness. The notes from me, <span id="ent-person-skylar-t-00-41-01"><a href="/entities/person-skylar.md">Skylar</a></span>. It says two jets that landed from <span id="ent-gpe-arizona-t-00-41-01"><a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a></span> into <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-41-01"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> because we started tracking those jets. I think the planes are going to tell us a story. If you could just copy that and from there up into the 9-11—yeah, that'd be great so that they can see that. We started then looking at the planes that day, and something that struck us as actually—<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>—I would just—I mean, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>—goodness. <a href="/entities/person-skylar.md">Skylar</a>, if you could just delete the name of the agent is the only thing I would delete because it's not relevant for them. ^t-00-41-01

Anyway, so there were two planes that we could find that right after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-41-45"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> gets shot scrambled— and from <span id="ent-gpe-scottsdale-t-00-41-45"><a href="/entities/gpe-scottsdale.md">Scottsdale</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-arizona-t-00-41-45"><a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a></span>. We're trying to figure out like, "Okay, like who came in?" And something that caught us—something that we think is interesting—is that the tail number N40JD, right? Had a day where they went up from <a href="/entities/gpe-scottsdale.md">Scottsdale</a> in the morning. And I think it was—if you want to bring that up, Mark—at seven o'clock in the morning, they left. You wanna pull it up? That's N40JD. ^t-00-41-45

Oh no, that's the other tail number—just kidding—the G5 plane. Okay, switch that. This is why he needs to bring this in. Tail number N102DZ. We'll have it up in a second. N102DZ—we're interested in because at 7:12 a.m. in the morning in <span id="ent-gpe-scottsdale-t-00-42-28"><a href="/entities/gpe-scottsdale.md">Scottsdale</a></span>—so that's local time in <a href="/entities/gpe-scottsdale.md">Scottsdale</a>—it flies from <a href="/entities/gpe-scottsdale.md">Scottsdale</a> to <span id="ent-gpe-salt-lake-city-t-00-42-28"><a href="/entities/gpe-salt-lake-city.md">Salt Lake City</a></span>. So instantly I was like, "Oh, this could be <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) plane." But then like, why would <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-42-28"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> fly into <a href="/entities/gpe-salt-lake-city.md">Salt Lake City</a>? No, he would fly into <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-42-28"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>, obviously, because <a href="/entities/gpe-salt-lake-city.md">Salt Lake City</a> is like 60 miles away. You don't fly private so that you can then take a 60-mile car unless there's some reason that you would have to—like the airport was closed. And I don't think that's true. Maybe it is. ^t-00-42-28

But this plane flew from <span id="ent-gpe-scottsdale-t-00-43-11"><a href="/entities/gpe-scottsdale.md">Scottsdale</a></span> and then landed in <span id="ent-gpe-salt-lake-city-t-00-43-11"><a href="/entities/gpe-salt-lake-city.md">Salt Lake City</a></span> at 9:23 a.m. local time. And then <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-43-11"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> gets shot at 12:23, and this plane scrambles, and it leaves <a href="/entities/gpe-salt-lake-city.md">Salt Lake City</a> and it heads to <a href="/entities/gpe-scottsdale.md">Scottsdale</a> at one o'clock p.m. So that's pretty quick, but coming from <a href="/entities/gpe-salt-lake-city.md">Salt Lake City</a> doesn't make sense to me. So I'm thinking this had somebody, but why did they go to <a href="/entities/gpe-salt-lake-city.md">Salt Lake City</a>? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Okay. ^t-00-43-11

And then they are only on the ground for 15 minutes. They turn around, and they go right back to—they go right back to <a href="/entities/gpe-scottsdale.md">Scottsdale</a>. It's possible this plane picked up <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-43-52"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. It's possible this plane picked up— there's a lot of people that were coming in.

I don't know who was on this plane, but I'm wondering about that first trip—not even the second trip. It makes sense that you would obviously go pick up people. We know people were racing there. Everyone has told the story a thousand times. But why was this plane in <span id="ent-gpe-salt-lake-city-t-00-43-52"><a href="/entities/gpe-salt-lake-city.md">Salt Lake City</a></span> in the first place? That's what I'm interested in, I guess, if that makes sense to you guys. And that is what we have been working on. ^t-00-43-52

All right, you guys. I'm going to take a brief pause here to tell you guys about <span id="ent-org-preborn-t-00-44-38"><a href="/entities/org-preborn.md">PreBorn</a></span>. You guys know that I love them and the work that they are doing because I think we all recognize in this moment that silence is not kindness. Silence is consent. And right now, the greatest silence is surrounding the topic of abortion—the lives that are lost before they are even allowed to take their first breath. Going to call ourselves defenders of life, we should act like it. That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love. For just $28—that's what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion. Just $28 helps her to see the life that's growing inside of her—gives her the truth that our culture does not. So you shouldn't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. You can be bold. You can be clear. ^t-00-44-38

Give $28. You can even give 10 times that if you'd like to. This is the line that we should all hold, and it's time to stand on it—standing for truth and what is right by saving lives from abortion and standing firm in the gospel. Again, that is <a href="/entities/org-preborn.md">preborn</a>.org/<a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>. Provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also want to tell you guys about <span id="ent-org-the-wellness-company-t-00-45-22"><a href="/entities/org-the-wellness-company.md">The Wellness Company</a></span> because it is officially cold and flu season, which means that it's also flu shot season. And after everything that we have been through over the last five years, the number of people that are actually getting the flu shot is at a record low. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective—whatever that means. And that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries, of course. There is a much better way to stay healthy. ^t-00-45-22

If you wake up with a sore throat or a runny nose, you can address those symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit that contains ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, a generic Z-pack, and there's a lot more in there too. It's like having an urgent care clinic in your own home. You can use that Contagion Emergency Kit from <a href="/entities/org-the-wellness-company.md">The Wellness Company</a>. And I do it simply because I refuse to be trapped in line at the emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance for catching a simple cold. You can just open the kit when you get it, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and you can get right back to life. The kit is literally a lifesaver with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need.

Nimi is doing something that seems quite radical by building one of the most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth—which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils—which means that your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Nimi has two products from their tallow line that you should definitely know about. First, for your daily hydration, there's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is gonna be your go-to moisturizer. It's light; it absorbs quickly; and it does not leave you with that greasy feeling. They combine that with soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil. ^t-00-58-11

And then for the problem areas, they also have the Buzz & Tallow Balm—which is an ultra-rich balm that uses tallow and beeswax to create a protective barrier. It locks in moisture. It shields your skin from the elements, allowing it to heal. This is skincare the way that it was meant to be—of course: simple, natural, pure, and powerfully effective. It's a focus on skin-loving ingredients made right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-58-56"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>.
