**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** All right, you guys. Well, if Halloween is your thing, then I definitely have a scary story for you. And it's scary because it's not fiction, okay? This is real life: the assassination of my friend, Charlie (Charlie Kirk). We are now, I believe, extremely close to solving this thing. I think after this episode, you are going to recognize that there is just irrefutable proof that there were in fact foreign actors involved. And of course, that implies that our government knows. Our government absolutely knows. We already felt that way. So let's jump right back into this impromptu episode. Welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=49" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-00-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, I want to preface this by letting you guys know that I am positively exhausted. I have been up all night realizing what we were suddenly on the brink of. I stumbled into it. I wouldn't even say accidentally. Obviously, this has been on my mind since we all watched Charlie (Charlie Kirk) be executed in front of the world, and then a lot of people lied about it—and a lot of people who were not acting right or grieving right, who were his closest comrades and business partners. And let's be frank: as I get inch closer and closer to discovering the truth, we should recognize that this is pretty dangerous stuff. ^t-00-00-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=82" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-01-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And my theory now—I feel confident stating—that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was taken out by something much bigger than the Turning Point USA organization that he was running, and certainly much bigger than Tyler Robinson on the LDS rooftop, who I don't even think even set foot on the campus that day. And I think another thing that I should mention is just how positively sad it is. We can reflect on how sad it is already that there are so many people in the world who are convinced they've emailed me. I mean, I've received an unbelievable amount of emails from people that are convinced that Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) actually still alive, right? ^t-00-01-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=125" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-02-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And it's not sad because those people are crazy. They're actually reacting to the lack of emotion and the lack of drive that is coming out of Turning Point USA to figure out who killed him. That's what they're reacting to. So, like, they came to, okay, this is so unnatural—the reaction of these individuals who were so close to him— that the more logical, sensible conclusion is that they actually know where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is and he's perfectly alive. Yeah, that is how absurd they are acting. Just move on. Just donate to Turning Point USA. This is what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would want. And that's his legacy. So what happened? Why are we here? Why are we live on Friday? I gave up Fridays, but this is so relevant to what's happening. ^t-00-02-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=167" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-02-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And I want to get this information out so that everyone in the world who has been helping me investigate could have the weekend to do research, and we can information share. The answer to the centralized intelligence agency, as we have said, is the decentralized intelligence agency. We must decentralize ourselves to plug out of this utterly demonic system. Anyway, what happened yesterday was obviously I did the show, and I circled back to the Egyptian military plane. I had simply tweeted about it while I was in Wyoming, obviously recognizing that it was not normal that this Egyptian military plane had departed on the morning of Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination. Now I made the mistake of thinking it had departed in the afternoon, ^t-00-02-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=206" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-03-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** and the reaction to it—this is how you always know the giveaway—is they overreact to something, and then the military bots make it a trending story. Like, there's no way this was trending. This guy correcting me on the timing—he tweets it, and the next thing you know it's trending: "Egyptian plane debunked." It was not debunked. I showed you that yesterday. Okay. Thanks to a very brave person—a foreigner, actually—who informed me that the people who came in on that plane were not the people that went out on that plane. So where did they go? They were estimating like approximately 18 people were on the plane that came over, and far less were on the way back. Where did these people go? Well, let me tell you something. ^t-00-03-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=251" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-04-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** As you know, because I am relying on you guys for tips—I'm grateful that I have a platform, but I don't exist without you guys— I'm always checking the comments to see if I got something wrong, if I made a mistake, if there's something that I missed. And somebody I just happened to catch gave a live comment right after the show. I was looking at your comments, and he said, "Oh, Candace, that plane we covered, the tail number SUBTT—just so you know—like a year earlier, that plane was in Utah at the same time as Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." In 2023, I was like, "Oh, that's pretty ironic if that's true." I was like, it's probably not true—except it actually was true. ^t-00-04-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=291" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-04-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So I started last night, and I said, "Okay, maybe that was a coincidence. Let me actually—since I presented that timeline for you every time I came to America—see if it was always near Charlie (Charlie Kirk), or if it was always near some big Turning Point event, if something was going on with Turning Point." And the answer, you guys—if you thought once was maybe, twice was a coincidence, three times we have a conspiracy—we're at about every single time that we could go back on this plane, and we're not done, obviously. There was something happening at Turning Point USA that was neighboring, okay—in the same city. So I'm gonna take you through this timeline. This is so shocking to me. And I've color-coordinated this timeline. I'm sure there are going to be some errors. ^t-00-04-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=335" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-05-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Pick them up, Zionists. Go hard. Make a trend. For the rest of us, let me know if there's slight adjustments that need to be made. But I think we've done a pretty thorough job. So I'm gonna let you know what you are looking at, okay? Tail number—there's two actually Egyptian planes—because then somebody else mentioned to me, "Hey, Candace, there was another Egyptian plane that left three hours after—Egyptian military plane that is—three hours after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated from Provo, Utah." And that tail number is SUBND. And you should take a look at that. And I thought to myself, "Okay, I'll take a look at that. Maybe that's where the rest of the passengers went. ^t-00-05-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=370" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-06-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Maybe that emptied SUBTT left in the morning, and three hours after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated—or maybe it's the next day. I'm sorry. Marcus corrected me in my ear: three days after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated—that's when the rest of the Egyptian crew, whoever was on that plane, departed Provo." So we have two tail numbers, and they're gonna be color-coordinated to make it really easy for you, okay? Tail number SUBND. That's a Gulfstream 4. It's about 12 to 16 passengers. And tail number SUBTT. That's gonna be our main one. That's our Falcon 7X. Again, holds about 12 to 16 passengers. ^t-00-06-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=408" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-06-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, for those of you who are not jumping around, flying on private jets all the time, the tail number—essentially—is like the best way to think of it—like a public plane. We'll say American Airlines on it, right? In order for systems to know how planes are moving in the sky, they kind of have to give them a license plate in the sky, so to speak, right? So the tail number is a unique license plate that literally is called the tail number because it's on the tail of the plane, okay? We're going to start with—and I'm going to show you this. I'm showing you this just because 2022—as you can see, I haven't made any notes on this because I haven't gotten back that far. But these are the four times that BTT—so they're both SU—that BTT was here in 2022. ^t-00-06-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=452" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-07-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** That's the furthest that we can go back on FlightRadar. Now we're going to go into 2023. And I have included notes that I think might be relevant to the story. So in 2023, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—I went back on his X feed—and he is hitting hard on Ukraine. I mean, like, he's tweeting out photos of Zelensky half-naked 'cause you know, he used to be an actor. Obviously he's a homosexual male. He's basically demanding—keep this up the whole time, guys. I want them to be able to look through this. He's basically demanding that we pull out of the Ukrainian war. He's accusing Ukraine and Zelensky of corruption, of financial fraud, of money laundering. ^t-00-07-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=494" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-08-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** You go back, and he's just basically declared war on the Ukrainian war—figuratively speaking, okay? And he's not siding on Team Ukraine. He's not pro-Russia, but he's not... I think that's relevant, obviously, because—yeah—when you talk about money laundering around Ukraine and Romania, you're actually stepping on the heels of America, right? That's not something that you can just say when you run this pro-American organization, given the fact that these people run our government. January 10th to 19th—I'm going to also say that I think this is relevant. Rob McCoy hosts the first-ever Turning Point USA Faith Pastors Tour of Israel. He's guiding a group of pastors through Jerusalem. ^t-00-08-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=536" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-08-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** On February 20th, I think this might be relevant because the same people that infiltrated or hostilely took over James O'Keefe were involved with Turning Point USA. James O'Keefe was the founder and the president of Project Veritas, and he and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and myself all met at the same time in November at that David Horowitz Freedom Center event that I was telling you about. James O'Keefe was really young. So we all kind of came up in this movement together and have always been very defensive of one another. So on February 20th, there's this like hostile takeover— what appears to the public, at least, is a hostile takeover of Project Veritas. James O'Keefe gets pushed out. ^t-00-08-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=580" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-09-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** He's ousted from the board of his own company. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) publicly announces his support for what he perceives—like the rest of the world perceived—was a bit of a hostile takeover. Okay? February 21st, we now have BND, okay? It flies into St. Louis, Missouri, and it lands at 2:38 p.m., and it's gonna stay until May. The blue one you're gonna see stays longer when it arrives, and then the yellow one will come behind it. BTT will come behind it, okay? So on February 25th, BTT comes in. And BTT—again, they're both flying from Cairo every time, typically through Paris—and it then lands in St. Louis, Missouri. ^t-00-09-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=620" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-10-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And this is relevant because on February 27th, this person who I hadn't heard of before named Sean Feucht. I believe I'm saying that correctly. Sean Feucht is announced as the Turning Point USA Faith contributor. Now, this guy is in partnership with Rob McCoy still today and to this day at Turning Point USA doing Turning Point USA Faith stuff. And this is also relevant because by all accounts, this guy is a sleaze. And what I mean is that people were coming forward and saying the money's looking funny with this guy. He's not a true Christian. He's faced accusations of fraud, of embezzlement. I'm painting a picture for you. ^t-00-10-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=662" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-11-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** But to stay on this Sean Feucht thing—I had to actually look him up, and I saw it on his biography and on Wikipedia, by the way. So this is—I haven't done a deep dive on him by any means—but I was like, I recognize that name. And I recognize that name because many people emailed us after Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination, and they thought Sean Feucht was the guy that was standing and cheering "USA! USA!" And I think he did a video and denied it. But that's the only familiarity—like the only way that I was familiar with that name. So look him up on his biography. And it tells us that he was born in Montana. He's a son of a dermatologist. That dermatologist is not named. He's, of course, a Christian Zionist, you guys—that's obvious. ^t-00-11-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=703" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-11-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** But he grew up playing music in a New Apostolic Reformation Church, okay? New Apostolic Reformation. Going forward, we're going to term that NAR: N-A-R, okay? And he would record prayers and prophecies that were made and impacted Feucht, it says, as he was growing up, okay? He was a part of the NAR Apostle Che Ahn's prayer rallies, it tells us, okay? Point being is that he is involved with NAR. Now, the reason why I'm telling you that is because there is a Twitter user—an X user—named Melissa. She goes by Mel, and she uses the handle Village Crazy Lady. ^t-00-11-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=747" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-12-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And her and I have been speaking because you just know when someone is a real one out there. And I've been watching her, and I'm like, "Okay, she's on it. She's like me. She's a mom. We're not messing around with what's going on in the world today." And she's been calling people out left and right. She's not pro-Israel. She's also a Catholic. And when her and I spoke about this Turning Point thing, she said, "Are you familiar with NAR?" And I said, "No, Mel, I'm not familiar with NAR. What's NAR?" And she was like, "I'm looking into this. I'm digging into this NAR thing. There's something here." If we start talking about Rob McCoy, something's going on here. So she's going down the figurative NAR rabbit hole. If you don't know who she is, you should follow her. I told her to pin whatever she's learned about NAR to the top of her profile today. That's Village Crazy Lady. But that's the introduction. ^t-00-12-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=790" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-13-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So NAR is somehow going to be relevant. Again, we are at an early phase in this investigation. Let's jump back into our timeline here, okay? So he is announced that he is going to be heading up. Rob McCoy is obviously now the co-chair of TPUSA Faith. He brings on Sean Feucht, presumably. And on February 28th, Sean Feucht is announced that he's going to be heading up the Kingdom to the Capitol Tour. So he becomes the face of this Turning Point USA Faith Tour. So, and of course, the first event that they do—as I just mentioned to you—that plane gets to St. Louis, Missouri. And sure enough, Sean Feucht is there. TPUSA Faith is there. ^t-00-13-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=833" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-13-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** They are at the Capitol, and they're doing this event. Okay, so interesting. I went, "Okay, that's kind of interesting." Let's keep going. Now I just have—I'm just going to scroll through this because this is timeline one for myself, because it's going to keep building. Everywhere that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is speaking, everywhere that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is speaking. Let's look at March 24th, 2023. I'll tell you why this is interesting to me. Turning Point USA has their first-ever Faith Pastor Summit. I spelled that wrong there—the Faith Pastor Summit. And it's in Nashville, and it's headed by Rob McCoy. ^t-00-13-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=865" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-14-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And lo and behold, while they're here, there is a trans shooting—a traumatizing trans shooting—in which the feds engage in a coverup regarding. Okay, you remember this shooting because it was at a Christian elementary school. It was at a Christian elementary school. It was incredibly traumatizing for all of us that lived here, and then doubly traumatizing—not just because we have kids—but because then we got no answers. They just wanted to hush-hush this. This is just a crazy trans person. Nothing else to see here. Goodbye. ^t-00-14-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=898" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-14-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, what I will say to you is Rob McCoy has got some terrible luck, is what I would say, because he's there when that trans shooting happens. Obviously, he's very close to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) when his shooting happens. He says, "I was his pastor." But also I had received a tip that Rob McCoy—who is from Thousand Oaks, which happens to be a very corrupt place—was very involved in a shooting that happened in 2018. When I say involved, I should rephrase that. I don't mean like he shot anybody. What I mean is that he was the nearby pastor of a Thousand Oaks shooting that happened at some bar where a veteran shot up a bar. Skylar, can you pull this up? Because I don't even remember the details. We received an email, and they were like, ^t-00-14-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=941" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-15-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** he was very close with the shooter's mom. The shooter was a veteran. They killed two Marine vets among some other—it looks like—bystanders. Bystanders at this bar. What bar was it? Something Bar and Grill? I'll look it up in a second if you don't have that quickly. 2018. Give me one second, guys. Just want to make sure that we have the facts of when this happened. 2018, Thousand Oaks. Shooting. I can't hear you for talking in my ear, but yeah, there was a shooting here at the Borderline Bar, okay? This is on November 7th, 2018. ^t-00-15-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=979" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-16-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** A former machine gunner in the Marines, okay, opens fire on patrons at the Borderline Bar and Grill. It kills 11 patrons and then himself. And then when you hear who the victims are, there's some other Marines and some veterans there. So I'm starting to get the feeling—by the way, and I don't know about the rest of you—and these are Candace's musings—that maybe these kind of random shootings that instantly get covered up but always involve like an army veteran aren't actually that random, and maybe the military is involved in them—like there's a target inside of there. Okay, that's a segue. ^t-00-16-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=1017" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-16-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Going back to Rob McCoy and him having bad luck—this person tells me that he knew the shooter's mother, was his pastor or something. Happy to correct that. But then also got close to the victim's family, and the victim's family got upset with him. Anyways, just put that in your back pocket. I just thought that I should mention that—like he's got some luck, or bad luck rather, okay? March 27th—like I said—is when we have that trans shooting at Covenant Elementary School in Nashville. And then we go back into our timeline. You can see on April 1st, we have that plane—we're gonna call it the yellow plane for the sake of this timeline. The yellow plane flies from Cairo—always via Paris—to St. Louis again, and it lands in Missouri. And guess what? ^t-00-16-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=1061" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-17-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** April 2nd, TPUSA Faith— co-chaired by Rob McCoy—kicks off their tour with an event headed by Sean Feucht in Jefferson City, Missouri the very next day while this plane is here. Okay. Let's keep going. Okay. April 6th, it leaves, and it always goes through Delaware when it leaves and goes back to Cairo. Okay. Now I am just kind of putting down for you here again other places where Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) here, where he is, because I know that I'm going to—this is going to build into my timeline. You know, I'm looking in, and Sean Feucht is in Israel related to some more Faith stuff. I don't know if Turning Point sponsors that trip or not. That's why I put a note there. ^t-00-17-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=1103" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-18-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at that is speaking in Sacramento on April 13th. Yellow plane again comes in. This time it flies to Kansas. Cairo to Kansas. And on April 23rd, Sean Feucht heads up the TPUSA Faith Kingdom to the Capitol Tour event, which happens to be in Topeka, Kansas. So I have a question. When did—how did he get here from Israel? Did he fly into Wichita the day before and then make the very short drive to make his event? ^t-00-18-23

It's about—I think—just under two hours to get from Wichita, Kansas to Topeka where the TPUSA Faith Kingdom to the Capitol Tour continues. Okay. April 3rd, BND is in here doing—it does a test flight. I think I might've dropped this blue thing. Oh yeah, it's been here the whole time. That's right. This plane stays here a long time. So it's been here from February 21st, and then it's going to head out, and it just leaves on May 9th, okay? That's gonna end 2023. ^t-00-19-02

February. Now we're going now into 2024. I guess actually let's start with January. And January 3, 2024—Mikey McCoy's promoted to the chief of staff of Turning Point USA. I have the internal email, so that is a fact. He gets the promotion. Now you can see, I guess, the McCoys are much more involved in Turning Point USA. I did not know them, so this has to be the year that they got super involved because I'm gonna do my last speech for them in June of 2024. Anyways, he gets promoted to chief of staff. And then on February 8th, Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) campus tour is publicly announced. I'm doing it with him. ^t-00-19-41

Our Egyptian military plane comes in. This time it is headed to Nebraska, and it lands in Nebraska and then flies straight to Lincoln, Nebraska. It lands in Omaha—pardon—and then flies straight over to Lincoln, and it stays in Lincoln for a mysterious five days. Now I'm racking my brains. I couldn't find anything going on with Turning Point, but I was like, I bet there's something going on in Turning Point in Lincoln, Nebraska, because that's a pretty precise location for this plane to go to. And lo and behold, Turning Point USA on February 11th—while this is going on— starts a chapter in Lincoln, Nebraska. I'm not kidding. Here's the post. Now, to be clear—because people will go out and say, "Oh, they already had events at the University of Nebraska"— ^t-00-20-27

And, you know, people in that area who are interested in Turning Point USA will work to make events happen. They did not have a Lincoln-specific Nebraska chapter according to their own Instagram—as you can see—until February 11th. This is a chapter Instagram. I should be clear. This is the UNL—University of Nebraska, Lincoln. And they're saying it's gonna be our first weekly meeting. Here it is. And in the—I think you cut off the bond. Oh, and it's on the right side. "Starting next week, TPUSA at UNL—it is official. Our first weekly meeting." Okay. February 20th, Nebraska City Campus. ^t-00-21-11

You got it. I would like to know if you are a Turning Point USA insider and you are watching this show: who started that chapter? That is very relevant to my research right now. Who started the Lincoln, Nebraska chapter? Because I can't find that. I've looked through. I've tried to see who was the first person. Typically, I think to start a charter chapter, you have to apply, so there's got to be some students. And maybe you're in Lincoln, Nebraska, and you can ask around: who said, "Hey, let's start this chapter in Lincoln, Nebraska all by ourselves. We're not going to be regional anymore"? I need to know who that is. Okay. So that happens, and then on February 14th, our plane departs back for Cairo. ^t-00-21-56

Yeah, okay. So that's February 14th, right? It comes back pretty quickly—pretty quickly. On March 29th, BTT—our yellow plane—departs Egypt again, and it comes back to Wichita, Kansas. It lands at 2:19 p.m. in Wichita, Kansas. And guess who was in Kansas that week? I mean, it's just incredible. It is incredible. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was speaking at the University of Kansas, okay, on April 3rd. ^t-00-22-39

This is a conspiracy. This plane is following Turning Point USA Faith and Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—and/or Charlie (Charlie Kirk). By the way, at those TPUSA Faith events, it's possible Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was speaking. I just can't find it. It's very difficult to search Charlie (Charlie Kirk) right now and to go back. So I'm going to continue to build this timeline, but you're getting the picture here. Let's keep going. So yes, that plane comes in here. And then I have here on April 9th that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is in Omaha, Nebraska, speaking at the Lord of Hosts Church. So he's doing TPUSA Faith stuff in general. And then we get our blue—our blue plane comes in. Our blue plane— remember—is the one that whenever it's here, it's going to sit for a little bit. ^t-00-23-21

It goes to Provo. It comes in from Cairo via Paris. It makes a stop in Salt Lake City, and then goes on to Provo. That is April 19th, okay? Lo and behold, BTT is then going to come in from Cairo via Paris through North Dakota to Provo. The planes are together. Again, you know, they're meeting up. They're kind of tracking each other. And who's in the area? Who's in Utah at the same time? Of course, Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is doing a Salt Lake University event. Sorry, it's not Salt Lake University. ^t-00-24-03

I think that's correct. So he is doing an event at Salt Lake—at the University of Utah. It's a "Prove Me Wrong" event. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is here, of course. And then we have that BTT— that's our yellow plane—departs on April 28th. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) event is over, so we can move on. Also have here that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) spoke in North Dakota, so he's in the area. And then on July 17th, our blue plane is going to leave, right? It always lags behind our yellow plane. Now let's get into 2024. This is the year that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) gets assassinated, right? I don't know what this plane is doing. I don't know who's on the plane. ^t-00-24-47

And it is going to be extremely relevant. I'm telling you, it is going to be extremely relevant. And my best guess is that they are going to try to hide that or lie about it. And I'm wondering if these planes potentially maybe had some Americans on them, because that would be incredibly relevant. Anyways, let's get into 2024 here. We're gonna start with: just the planes don't come in at all in the beginning. This is me just putting down Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) schedule. May 23rd is the first time one of the planes comes in, and that is the blue plane. ^t-00-25-27

And I'm gonna say that to us—when we looked at this—it appeared to be a legitimate maintenance stop—like that they came in because there was just some test flying that was happening around that time. I don't know for certain. Obviously we're building upon this timeline. But the blue plane—our lag plane—gets into Provo on May 23rd, okay? I'm going to keep with this timeline. You can see in June of 2024, by the way, is when the article broke: Sean Feucht is credibly accused of having been involved in fraud and embezzlement. ^t-00-26-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=1607" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:26:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-26-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** There are multiple organizations that are banding together to say that he's immoral, he is unethical, that he has shady financial activities. He's misrepresented his ministry activities. Ceaseless financial solicitation, they accuse him of—intermingled with grand visions—which has led to untold financial gain and a steady stream of unpaid labor from volunteers. Starting to sound a little bit familiar here. And they make statements that he was purportedly using—and I'm going to say this allegedly; I'm reading this from the article—using business credit cards for personal expenses. He diverted donations to personal accounts. He inflated the prices that were paid to vendors. ^t-00-26-47

I mean, there's all of these allegations that are coming from him. And by the way, even people who formerly worked at Turning Point USA say the same thing: that there's something not right about Sean Feucht. And despite all of this—and this breaks down the very many properties that they say are owned by him—very expensive properties, by the way. There's always going to be a real estate theme. And what we're going to discuss later— it's almost going to be like a real estate theme. They're breaking down like this guy owns a ton of properties. He's moving a lot of properties. That's interesting to me. ^t-00-27-28

Not making any allegations against him, but I'm going to make some broader allegations that when I started piercing this layer of the Mormon church, I was like, "Is this a church or is this a real estate empire?" Never seen so many real estate transactions in my life: people that were paying in cash—paying cash more than what the property was worth. And I'm going—me—when I see this much real estate being purchased in cash, I know a thing or two about money laundering. It's a good business to be in, is all I'm saying, right? It's a good business to be in. And I got to be honest: these megachurches are looking a little funny. Okay, they're looking a little funny. What was it? ^t-00-28-10

Do you remember this story? Megachurch pastor Joel Osteen—his church. I think it was—I gotta pull it up if you can find it, Skylar. The plumber is like, "Hey, I'm here to fix the toilet," and finds that actually there's like almost a million dollars of cash in one of the walls. And I think Joel Osteen issued a statement and was like, "Oh, well, you know, we are very surprised to see this." "It's very strange. This is in the walls of our church. That's amazing." God has blessed us greatly for supporting Israel. I'm joking—he didn't say that—but I think the excuse that he gave. Here it is: the plumber doing repairs—November 10th—at the megachurch, blah, blah, blah. There was a loose toilet in the wall. We removed the tile, and boom—500 envelopes fell out of the wall. ^t-00-28-55

And then the plumber contacted maintenance, and Joel Osteen's excuse was like, "We had some money that was missing at the church." Here it is. Why they're like, "I don't know—these pastors like tickle me now." It's like, "I don't know. That's so crazy." That is so crazy. There you are. There you are—million bucks. I did not see you there. Happens all the time—rich people problems, you know? Rich people problems—just so much money. You gotta put it behind a toilet. And he said that that's what they thought maybe it was—to me. To me, when I hear cash flowing like that—and we're talking like a lot of these megachurches are always in California or Arizona— ^t-00-29-39

I'm talking about the broader implications of cash being found in any place. I'm thinking the cartels, right? Like that's where my mind's at. I'm thinking cartel money is flowing through the border and could end up in a closet somewhere. Again, I'm not correlating that to Joel Osteen, but I do think the fact that that money was found there is weird, and his excuse makes no sense. I will say that. Now, jumping back into our timeline—where was I just now? We are—buh buh buh buh buh buh buh—this is when things start to get a little spicy for Charlie (Charlie Kirk), okay? So that's Sean Feucht. That's June 2024—money's looking funny, according to multiple people and organizations that have worked with him. ^t-00-30-24

Okay, Mark is saying that the Lincoln chapter was opened. I had that in the wrong date. That was supposed to be in May of 2024. Okay, we'll get back to that. Let me just get through this. Okay, so we have Tucker (Tucker Carlson) then speaks on July 11th of 2024. This is a very big deal, okay? Very big deal. Tucker (Tucker Carlson) gets on stage at Turning Point USA, and there was a donor panic—an absolute panic. ^t-00-31-07

He calls out Jeffrey Epstein, right? He's calling out Jeffrey Epstein. Dave Smith is speaking. They're talking about Israel being a problem. He's getting cheers from the crowd, right? This audience being like, "Yeah, no—why are we married to this like nation in the Middle East that happens to be committing a genocide?" But he also says things like, "You know, people that serve in foreign armies should probably have their citizenship stripped"—something along those lines. And he also muses about where Bill Ackman's wealth comes from. And yeah, it's just a speech—which, by the way, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was the one who told him backstage: "Go hard at Israel," right? He's done. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) done. He just is. That's just the reality—which is why I was crazy. I mean, people are trying to lie about this. ^t-00-31-52

And he's telling Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to go hard in the paint. Now, I know for a fact that when Tucker (Tucker Carlson) came off stage, one donor immediately—a woman who I have not named yet—instantly started yelling at Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) then gets the full donor squeeze. "You are not allowed to be anti-Israel." This feels like a good time to mention that the last time that I spoke at Turning Point USA's conference in 2024, there was this random sidebar conversation that I had with Tyler Bowyer. Tyler Bowyer is the king of shady at Turning Point USA. He is the one—like I said—that has—he has hired every person around Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-32-37

It's a Mormon one, okay? And Tyler Bowyer said to me backstage: there was something going on with like Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Nick Fuentes. I can't recall. This is again 2024. And I said to him, "Why don't you just have Charlie (Charlie Kirk) debate Nick? Like the common-sense thing to me is just like have the debate, right? It's not a big—it's like all of this." I think Nick had maybe come actually to the conference with like some people because he was doing that for a little bit. And I was like, "Why don't you just like debate them? Like, I don't know—I'm like pro-conversation." And Tyler said to me, "Turning Point USA will never—will just always be pro-Israel. Like we're just never not gonna be pro-Israel." Didn't think anything of it at the time, but in retrospect, it's kind of a weird thing to say. Like, what do you mean it will never be anti-Israel? What do you mean it will always be pro-Israel? ^t-00-33-17

We're pro-Israel. What do you mean that's just what we are? You're supposed to be an organization that's dedicated to free speech. And what comes with free speech is the ability to think freely, the ability to process the information that is being spoken to you and to think freely. You care about free markets, which I think actually relies upon free speech to have free markets. I don't even think the markets are free right now. And so I'm just trying to understand this concept that Turning Point is just never going to not be pro-Israel. Actually, in retrospect— and so if we fast forward a year later—Tucker (Tucker Carlson)'s on the stage, and his hype boy—his hype man—is Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And he's like, "Just hit 'em hard." And he goes out there, and he hits 'em harder than anything. And suddenly there's an explosion, right? And they're really angry. ^t-00-34-01

Josh Hammer is angry. Seth Dillon is angry. Far be it from them to ever tell the truth about that. These people were gonna lie. "Oh, he never blinked. And we were just as great as supporters." Bob Shillman is angry. And they're basically saying, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk), this can never happen again. And you have to be pro-Israel." That's kind of the vibes that they're putting down, okay? That happens July 11th, and now our plane is coming back from Egypt. Just nine days later, it goes through Omaha, Nebraska at 11:37 a.m. It departs, and it heads over to Lincoln, Nebraska, and it stays there for six days. ^t-00-34-46

And again, anybody who has the ability to pull the files—maybe you just work at the airport. I really would like to know who was on that plane. I think this July 20th date is very important. Very important. Okay. I think the post-TPUSA conference dates are critical to what happened here. Okay. Then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) speaks to New York, and after that he heads up to New York in the Hamptons. And he—Charlie (Charlie Kirk) himself—described it as an intervention. Seth Dillon is lying through his teeth, okay? People that were there said Seth Dillon was rowdy and pushing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and his views on Israel. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) himself described it as an intervention that was staged over his viewpoints on Israel. ^t-00-35-27

And maybe they were going to see if they could fix them. You know how every episode of Intervention ends. They ask you if you want to go to rehab because they love you. Okay? They read the letters. "Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I remember you. You were so brave." You were so brave, and you loved Israel, and you understood that your job is to be a good little goy and do what we say. I miss you. Do you want to go to rehab? But that phone call wasn't coming in from mom or dad. It was coming in from Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu). And that's kind of terrifying, actually. Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) is like pretending to be your friend: "Hey, come to Israel." How do we know that happened? Because Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) told us himself.

He said he called him two weeks ago, and he invited him to Israel. And the part that he left out was Charlie (Charlie Kirk) declined. So when he got the phone call to go to figurative rehab, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said, "No, I'm good." Actually, Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) offered to fund Turning Point to the next level. Okay. Andrew Colvett should be able to confirm that. Yes or no. Don't dance around it. I don't like the dancing him and Alex did. "Oh, this this bowl." It's a yes. Okay. Take it to the next level with what money, though? Actually, it is relevant, and it is true that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not know where the money was coming from. That's why he established DOGE. ^t-00-36-53

Now I'm not a forensic accountant. I am saying this so that those of you who are forensic accountants can go do what you do and figure out: for Charlie (Charlie Kirk), establish the Internet DOGE. Okay. Where was the money coming from, and where was it going to? And then my Turning Point insiders tell me the money was indeed looking funny. Okay, it was just a lot of money coming in really fast and going out really fast. And I can tell you what it sounds like. We don't have any facts on that. ^t-00-37-34

He says, "No, Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu). I don't know—maybe—where this money is coming from. I'm good. I'm not going to go to rehab in Israel, and I'm not gonna take your money." Charlie (Charlie Kirk) says no. Okay. And what happens next after the Hamptons retreat is that our—and I think this is a BTT. I didn't put this on August 17th. I missed this. BTT comes in. Is that BTT stays for six days? Yet because I went back to Cairo—BTT. ^t-00-38-16

And again, I think these trips are very important. Okay. Turning Point USA insiders—I know some of you guys are becoming more and more courageous— what was going on in Nebraska? What's going on with the Lincoln chapter? How did the Lincoln chapter come together? I think you were making one note that that was supposed to be in 2024—the Lincoln chapter came together. Is that what you were saying, Mark? Okay, so I'll edit that in our updated timeline so that you guys that are watching this can update that in your timeline. What is going on in Lincoln, Nebraska?

It comes down September 4th. It heads to Minot, North Dakota, and then it heads directly there to Provo. And it lands in Provo on September 4th at 12:46, and it had— it was a full plane. Okay, that's what we can say. It was a full plane according to a person overseas who had intimate knowledge. And I think the information is solid, and it was not a full plane when it departs the morning that Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) assassinated. So working with that. What's going on here? ^t-00-39-39

We then know that three days later—bringing that back up—on September 13th, our blue plane—which trails—is going to leave through Canada, as it always does. It's going to leave Provo. That's going to go through Canada, through Paris, and back home to Cairo— three days following Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Did that plane perhaps have the rest of the people that were left behind? What is going on? I wanna know. One more thing that I want to mention to you—and Skylar, I actually didn't tell you. ^t-00-40-17

Okay, under the notes from me—Charlie—because this is stuff that we're working on. I mean, Charlie—goodness. The notes from me, Skylar. It says two jets that landed from Arizona into Provo because we started tracking those jets. I think the planes are going to tell us a story. If you could just copy that and from there up into the 9-11—yeah, that'd be great so that they can see that. We started then looking at the planes that day, and something that struck us as actually—Charlie—I would just—I mean, Charlie—goodness. Skylar, if you could just delete the name of the agent is the only thing I would delete because it's not relevant for them. ^t-00-41-01

Anyway, so there were two planes that we could find that right after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) gets shot scrambled— and from Scottsdale, Arizona. We're trying to figure out like, "Okay, like who came in?" And something that caught us—something that we think is interesting—is that the tail number N40JD, right? Had a day where they went up from Scottsdale in the morning. And I think it was—if you want to bring that up, Mark—at seven o'clock in the morning, they left. You wanna pull it up? That's N40JD. ^t-00-41-45

Oh no, that's the other tail number—just kidding—the G5 plane. Okay, switch that. This is why he needs to bring this in. Tail number N102DZ. We'll have it up in a second. N102DZ—we're interested in because at 7:12 a.m. in the morning in Scottsdale—so that's local time in Scottsdale—it flies from Scottsdale to Salt Lake City. So instantly I was like, "Oh, this could be Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) plane." But then like, why would Charlie (Charlie Kirk) fly into Salt Lake City? No, he would fly into Provo, obviously, because Salt Lake City is like 60 miles away. You don't fly private so that you can then take a 60-mile car unless there's some reason that you would have to—like the airport was closed. And I don't think that's true. Maybe it is. ^t-00-42-28

But this plane flew from Scottsdale and then landed in Salt Lake City at 9:23 a.m. local time. And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) gets shot at 12:23, and this plane scrambles, and it leaves Salt Lake City and it heads to Scottsdale at one o'clock p.m. So that's pretty quick, but coming from Salt Lake City doesn't make sense to me. So I'm thinking this had somebody, but why did they go to Salt Lake City? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Okay. ^t-00-43-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=2632" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:43:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-43-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And so that G5 plane then gets back to Scottsdale at 1 p.m. local time, right—because they're going to gain time going backwards. And then they are only on the ground for 15 minutes. They turn around, and they go right back to—they go right back to Scottsdale. It's possible this plane picked up Erika. It's possible this plane picked up— there's a lot of people that were coming in. I think there's like—I don't know what Mikey McCoy's wife's name— I think she said she was there. Mikey McCoy was there. I don't know who was on this plane, but I'm wondering about that first trip—not even the second trip. It makes sense that you would obviously go pick up people. We know people were racing there. Everyone has told the story a thousand times. But why was this plane in Salt Lake City in the first place? That's what I'm interested in, I guess, if that makes sense to you guys. And that is what we have been working on. ^t-00-43-52

All right, you guys. I'm going to take a brief pause here to tell you guys about PreBorn. You guys know that I love them and the work that they are doing because I think we all recognize in this moment that silence is not kindness. Silence is consent. And right now, the greatest silence is surrounding the topic of abortion—the lives that are lost before they are even allowed to take their first breath. Going to call ourselves defenders of life, we should act like it. That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love. For just $28—that's what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion. Just $28 helps her to see the life that's growing inside of her—gives her the truth that our culture does not. So you shouldn't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. You can be bold. You can be clear. ^t-00-44-38

Give $28. You can even give 10 times that if you'd like to. This is the line that we should all hold, and it's time to stand on it—standing for truth and what is right by saving lives from abortion and standing firm in the gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace. Provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also want to tell you guys about The Wellness Company because it is officially cold and flu season, which means that it's also flu shot season. And after everything that we have been through over the last five years, the number of people that are actually getting the flu shot is at a record low. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective—whatever that means. And that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries, of course. There is a much better way to stay healthy. ^t-00-45-22

If you wake up with a sore throat or a runny nose, you can address those symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit that contains ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, a generic Z-pack, and there's a lot more in there too. It's like having an urgent care clinic in your own home. You can use that Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company. And I do it simply because I refuse to be trapped in line at the emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance for catching a simple cold. You can just open the kit when you get it, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and you can get right back to life. The kit is literally a lifesaver with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So head to twc.health/Candace today and use code CANDACE, and you'll save $48. ^t-00-46-07

Again, that's twc.health/Candace—code CANDACE—for $48 off. Kits are available to U.S. residents only. There's another strand of this that is compelling to me. And something that came—and again, this is opinion. I tried—I didn't cover it because it's opinion—but a lot of people felt at Turning Point USA—and I do mean a lot of people as in the wonderful people that work with the organization that are not at the top, right? And they felt that Mikey McCoy was kind of being positioned to take over for Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-46-52

But given the picture that we now have of his father and what his father is involved in—and the fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was kind of veering from what I think was a predetermined course for Turning Point USA—I have a lot of questions. Also, another person who wrote us was telling me the story about Tyler Bowyer's involvement in like Maricopa County politics in general—like what did he do before in Arizona? And yeah, it's just the kind of stories that he said. He approached him several times about embezzlement—you know, not Charlie. Tyler (Tyler Bowyer) was hooking up with young interns—young male interns or young male workers. And he didn't even care. ^t-00-47-35

And everybody knows about Tyler Bowyer at Turning Point USA. It's like an absurdity. But this is the person that is putting people into places of power at Turning Point USA. Like he's—he's just involved. Something that was interesting is also how many Russian speakers there are. I was telling you like UVU—there's just a lot of Russians and people who study Soviet studies. Even the president of UVU majored in Soviet studies. Tyler Bowyer majored in Soviet studies. He's a fluent Russian speaker. He spent years. ^t-00-48-18

And actually Ukrainians—until they like made it a law—they had to stop speaking Russian quite recently—were Russian speakers, right? Because it's Russia, and it's their home. So it's interesting to consider that there are a lot of—I think even Mikey McCoy's wife might be Ukrainian. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but that's something that I think is interesting as well—or could be interesting. It might not be interesting, but definitely I'm on Tyler Bowyer front. It's very interesting that he was involved with orphanages in Ukraine—posted about helping Russian-speaking orphans or whatever it is years ago. Like I'm talking like 10 years ago. ^t-00-48-51

I don't like it. The vibes don't feel right. What was going on? Why was Turning Point—you know—what was their campus doing? Why are people at Turning Point saying they don't know where the money's coming from? Why is no one seeming to be grieving him in the right way? Why does it feel to me like a hostile takeover of a company? That's how I personally feel. Okay, that's how I feel. I feel like this is a hostile takeover of a company. And I feel that the company became bigger than Charlie (Charlie Kirk) because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was too ambitious, and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) trusted people, and he trusted that people were in it for the right reasons. And what I have learned in politics is people are hardly ever in it for the right reasons, truly. If you are getting into politics, you think you're gonna meet good people—you're out of your mind. ^t-00-49-35

This was an assassination at a very high level, and they do communicate with numerology. And this—if this sounds above your head—it's probably because you're not in my book club. But it is just to me the most sinister and sickening thing that these people can lay their heads on the pillow at night, and they were just going to keep going. Okay. I feel a lot is adding up, and that more people need to look into Turning Point Faith. They need to look into NAR. Again, I would follow Village Crazy Lady on X.

I think actually when I now look at the picture—and I'm learning more about Rob McCoy and knowing that he was the co-chair in 2024 or maybe in 2023 of Turning Point USA— they believe—and this is why the Christian Zionism thing becomes so important—that they can hijack our emotions and tell us that it's our biblical duty to support the state of Israel because I think the state of Israel is probably involved in what is happening at the border, in what is happening overseas. It is definitively involved in all these wars. I mean, everywhere you look, Israel pops up. It doesn't matter if you're talking about Congo.

What are we talking about? Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a Christian Zionist because he believed that that was true. And I actually believe it is a perversion of scripture. And I am begging you all—those of you who go to these megachurches, those of you who are evangelical, who follow these evangelical influencers—you are probably noticing about now that they are mum on the topic of Charlie (Charlie Kirk).

I sense that there will be a turning point, but it is not going to be the one that they are banking on where a bunch of Christians are sold slop and are told that it is their God-given duty to support the nation of Israel while looking away from the fact that they're acting real weird in the hours after trial and assassination—doing way too much.

The Catholic thing must stay hush-hush. Why? It's all kind of adding up, right? They're attacking Tucker (Tucker Carlson) because he's attacking Christian Zionism.

I'm gonna take some of your comments after we get back from this brief break. All right, you guys—jumping in here to remind you about American Financing because what if you could delay your next two mortgage payments? That is what can happen here. Imagine putting those two payments instead in your pocket and finally getting a little bit of breathing room ahead of the holiday season. It's possible if you call American Financing today. If you're feeling stretched by everyday expenses—groceries, gas, bills that are piling up—you are not alone. ^t-00-56-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=3447" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:57:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-57-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Most Americans are putting these expenses on credit cards, and the credit card rates are insane right now—in the 20s or even the 30s. American Financing can show you how to use your home's equity to pay off that debt with rates in the low fives. Their salary-based mortgage consultants are helping homeowners just like you restructure their loans and save money every month. All without any upfront fees. Their customers are saving an average of about $800 a month—which is like a $10,000 raise annually without even having to change jobs. So call American Financing today and start saving. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or you can visit americanfinancing.net/Owens. Again, that's americanfinancing.net/Owens. And of course, I always tell you about Nimi Skincare. I love them. ^t-00-57-27

And obviously that's not true. The real secret is, of course, simple. That's why I love Nimi Skincare. Nimi is doing something that seems quite radical by building one of the most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth—which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils—which means that your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Nimi has two products from their tallow line that you should definitely know about. First, for your daily hydration, there's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is gonna be your go-to moisturizer. It's light; it absorbs quickly; and it does not leave you with that greasy feeling. They combine that with soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil. ^t-00-58-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=3536" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:58:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-58-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** It's perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind. And then for the problem areas, they also have the Buzz & Tallow Balm—which is an ultra-rich balm that uses tallow and beeswax to create a protective barrier. It locks in moisture. It shields your skin from the elements, allowing it to heal. This is skincare the way that it was meant to be—of course: simple, natural, pure, and powerfully effective. It's a focus on skin-loving ingredients made right here in the USA. So if you'd like to order, head to nemiskincare.com, explore their tallow line, and use my code CANDACE10 at checkout, and you'll get 10% off your order. That's N-E-M-I-skincare.com. All right, guys—very quickly because I am going to jump to a dinner reservation. Somebody made a comment—and thank you for that. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) actually did fly into Salt Lake City. So that was his plane. So that does make sense. ^t-00-58-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=3577" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:59:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-00-59-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** They would have had information. I was wondering why he was in Salt Lake City, but apparently he had an interview with Restaurantology Summit. So you can ignore that tidbit. Comments from stars saying, "Making sure I send a super chat today since the Zionists want to call you vermin for having so many supporters of truth. We love you, Candace. God bless you and your family and your whole team." Thank you so much. Jill writes, "I'm so disappointed in my pastor, Jack Hibbs. He was so close with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and yet he hasn't said nearly enough in my opinion." Well, Joe continues: "Christian Zionist loyalty to Jews and Israel seems to have replaced loyalty to God, the church, and the truth." Yeah, well, look—he's another big pastor. I can tell you about Jack Hibbs. He was one that—he was another person that PragerU was pushing to me—wanted me to interview him. I may have even interviewed him. I can't remember. ^t-00-59-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=3621" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:00:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-01-00-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** But they were like, "Pastor Jack Hibbs. Pastor Jack Hibbs." And now I look at that, and I'm thinking that's part of an operation. That's likely part of an operation. All these people that they wanted me to platform: Lila Rose, Jack Hibbs, Tim Ballard. I look back on that stuff, and I'm reflecting, and I realize that—like I said—I had handlers, and they were directing me to do things. I never really questioned the things they were directing me to do until today. So Jack Hibbs was also a part of like a Turning Point USA Faith event. And I am looking at Turning Point USA Faith sideways—especially because like he doesn't even care about the allegations against Sean Feucht. And what are they doing? It doesn't matter. We're just gonna keep on continuing working with him—Rob McCoy. Alpaca Renee writes, "God bless you, Candace. You're a warrior for such a time as this. ^t-01-00-21

I pray Jeremiah 29:11 over you and your family. Thank you. Voiceless writes, "I'd love to see how Google Trends line up with these flights, names of people who died in the shootings, shooters, et cetera." Well, as it turns out, one of those planes—I forgot to mention—and it's the second one, the blue plane, I believe—was Googled by Israel. The tail number for that plane was Googled by Israel on September 8th—two days before the assassination. So take from that what you will. Tim Morgan writes, "Candace, check out Sean Feucht and the allegations of financial ministry mismanagement online. ^t-01-01-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=3703" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:01:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-01-01-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And he and Pastor McCoy are planning a Courageous Christianity Tour to honor Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." I am really begging for the real Christians in this world to research these men, to watch this episode over and over again, to consider what I am telling you: that there has definitively been an infiltration, and Christian Zionists are at the helm of it. And I understand I'm at war now with all of them. That's fine, okay? I understood that I was at war the moment Charlie (Charlie Kirk) caught the bullet, okay? I get that. I get that. That—what could follow? It's gotta be war, right? It's either total submission or war, and I'm not gonna submit to these demons. Anyways, you guys—I'm sorry if I missed your comment. Norman Finkelstein—the interview with him—we bumped that because I felt this was so important to get out because we need to information share. ^t-01-01-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=3746" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:02:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-01-02-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** That interview is going to release at 7 p.m. Eastern—so in about 30 minutes if you stick around. It's an amazing interview, and it's a timely interview given what I am saying to you about Christian Zionism. You need to wake up to what has happened in Gaza and what has actually been going on. And the scales may fall from your eyes as quickly as they fell from mine on the topic of Israel. There was no justification. There definitively cannot be any godly justification for what they have done and what they have always done in Gaza. It is not new. It's not starting October 7th. Okay. This has been going on since they stole their land at gunpoint. It has been an effective Holocaust since 1948 by the legal definition of a Holocaust—which Norm Finkelstein will explain better than I do. ^t-01-02-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmRH8p5lt0&t=3791" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:03:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0/t-01-03-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And once you recognize the people defending that—beyond this—you will start to look at them as possessed by some sort of a demon. And typically that demon is just money, okay? They just want the money. And the Bible is explicit about that, right? You can't have both. And like I said, God's chosen people do not endorse that. In fact, only Satan's chosen people could. ^t-01-03-11
