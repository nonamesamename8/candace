I was waiting kind of a situation for her to be in, obviously having lost her husband, becoming the CEO and the chairman of a company. It's just a lot of transition and it's nice to wait for more information. before you prejudge or just assume, make an assumption about somebody and it maybe is not based in reality. Well, we are getting a lot more of <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a> this week. I'll tell you that because she has been doing the rounds in the media really over the last couple of weeks. And she just gave an interview live with <span id="ent-person-harris-faulkner-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-harris-faulkner.md">Harris Faulkner</a></span> on <span id="ent-org-fox-news-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-12-10-erika-kirk-interview-with-harris-faulkne-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-10-erika-kirk-interview-with-harris-faulkne.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, where she finally addressed the quote unquote conspiracy theories. And I have to say this because it's true. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-6DhWawD4ZiM/t-00-00-46.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:46</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DhWawD4ZiM&t=46" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** but it completely missed the mark for me. I am sorry, it just has. But the good news is that she is now unmuddying the water in terms of her intentions with this massive political organization. That's good news, truly, because we knew <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and now we are getting an opportunity to know <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. Plus later on in the show, it's Knives out for <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a></span>. As always, he's trending right now because he has officially waded into the who killed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> narrative<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve-t-00-00-46"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>. And since he is not a bought and paid for Fed, he is siding with not just the American people, people worldwide. And he says that he's not buying the official narrative. And there are some lingering questions. ^t-00-00-46

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-6DhWawD4ZiM/t-00-01-29.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:29</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DhWawD4ZiM&t=89" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And he confirms what I told you about the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-01-29"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> planes. So let's jump right back into this. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-01-29"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. Look, I have been very patient. I do tend to focus on the evidence that's in front of us, obviously asking questions when we come up across something that someone has said and it doesn't add up or if they lied, create a list. ^t-00-01-29

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-6DhWawD4ZiM/t-00-02-09.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:09</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DhWawD4ZiM&t=129" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And you guys were coming after me because I was saying, look, we can write into our imaginations how <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-02-09"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> is thinking or how she's feeling or what she should be wearing, but she hasn't actually said anything yet. right? That was my stance. She hasn't actually said anything yet. Give her a chance, okay? And now she is making the rounds in the press because <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-09"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s book, his posthumous book, is coming out about the Sabbath and she's speaking about the quote unquote conspiracies as she sits down with a lot of these news anchors. So first and foremost, she's sitting down here with <span id="ent-person-harris-faulkner-t-00-02-09"><a href="/entities/person-harris-faulkner.md">Harris Faulkner</a></span>. And I just want to show you a couple of clips from this sit down, which is now trending. ^t-00-02-09

That question resurfaced this week in a big way because <span id="ent-person-milo-yiannopoulos-t-00-02-53"><a href="/entities/person-milo-yiannopoulos.md">Milo</a></span> and a few others have asserted with absolute certainty that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> has not yet been buried. That's what they're saying. They say they have proof of that. And at first, <span id="ent-person-harris-faulkner-t-00-02-53"><a href="/entities/person-harris-faulkner.md">Harris Faulkner</a></span> is asking about that claim. Take a listen. ^t-00-02-53

Can I have one thing? Can my children have one thing? Everything was public. We will be building the most beautiful memorial for my husband at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-03-31"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, and it will be for the world to see, and it will be spectacular, and it will have basically museum style for our <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-31"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, for my <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>.

I think that when people are being buried and where they're being buried and how their funerals are done, that is very private matter, okay? So objectively, I agree with what she's saying, okay? But subjectively, because we are dealing with the subject of <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-04-36"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span>, and what transpired immediately following <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-36"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination, this is going to be read as <span id="ent-person-meghan-markle-t-00-04-36"><a href="/entities/person-meghan-markle.md">Meghan Markle</a></span> syndrome, okay? <a href="/entities/person-meghan-markle.md">Meghan Markle</a> syndrome where you want privacy when you want it, but you want publicity whenever you want it, and that just doesn't work, okay? It doesn't work that way. I honestly think it was said best by <span id="ent-person-bethany-frankel-t-00-04-36"><a href="/entities/person-bethany-frankel.md">Bethany</a></span>, not related to this situation. ^t-00-04-36

And she was referring to one of the housewives who lived her life very publicly, showcased her marriage, was buying tons of Louis Vuitton bags, and they had tons of money. And then when the relationship soured, the housewife basically asked the public for privacy. And <span id="ent-person-bethany-frankel-t-00-05-21"><a href="/entities/person-bethany-frankel.md">Bethany</a></span> was like, no, this isn't how it works. We were riding with you on the way up or riding with you on the way out. You don't get to like pick and choose when you want privacy and when you don't want privacy. And subjectively as it... you know, in the matter of <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-05-21"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span>, this is the same person who recorded, had somebody record her over <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-21"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s casket. That was not our business, truly. ^t-00-05-21

I wouldn't even record myself over a casket ever, okay? Some people maybe perhaps wanna have that memory, but the decision to publish that You crying over your husband's casket and to publish his dead body on Instagram was a decision that was made by <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-06-02"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> and we can watch that.

There was no reason to do that outside of wanting to share something that was very private with the public. And now you fast forward three months removed and it's why does the public wanna know where he's buried? It doesn't work like that. You have to make a decision. I want this always to be private or I want this always to be public. That's my personal feedback there. Later on in this same interview, she launches into a strong defense of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-06-51"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> employees who have just as a matter of fact told many lies, many inconsistencies, these are verifiable. ^t-00-06-51

But I will tell you what they are doing. It reminds me so much of chapter 6 in the book of <span id="ent-person-nehemiah-t-00-07-51"><a href="/entities/person-nehemiah.md">Nehemiah</a></span>. He is building a wall and the townspeople are at the base of that hill saying, <a href="/entities/person-nehemiah.md">Nehemiah</a>, calling him all these names, saying all these things, come on down. Every single time he had the same message four times in a row, I cannot come down. I am busy building. That is how I feel. I do not have time to address the noise. My silence does not mean that I am complacent. My silence does not mean that somehow <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-07-51"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> and all of the handpicked staff that loved my husband and my husband loved them is somehow in on it. ^t-00-07-51

And you know what I thought? I thought these people are human. We are all grieving in our own way, and they are trying to find the answer to something that happened that was so evil. They are trying so hard, and I get that. We're doing the same. Anytime we hear a lead or anytime we hear anything, we send it to the authorities. Please dig into this. No rock will be unturned. I want justice for my husband, for myself, for my family, more than anyone else out there. So for me, you wanna keep telling me to come down while we're building?

And now, thanks to a generous match program, your gift can be doubled as well.

And now, because you guys sent so many emails and actually people who were on that base in <span id="ent-gpe-arizona-t-00-39-28"><a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a></span>, the Wachuca base in <a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a>, adding further credence to his claim is we've been able to since verify two more things from other people that are currently stationed there. First and foremost, I should tell you we have a positive ID on <span id="ent-person-captain-adam-neff-t-00-39-28"><a href="/entities/person-captain-adam-neff.md">Captain Neff</a></span>.

There were several, obviously, but <a href="/entities/person-captain-adam-neff.md">Adam Neff</a> was leading the interrogation of him. And it checks out because that is the division from New York. Also, we have now confirmed, and this is exciting, because we got a lot of emails going, oh, if this was really this meeting, people wouldn't have known it was taking place. They would have used an empty building or something like that. Well, guess what? ^t-00-40-11

Again, we have now verified this outside of this individual who was definitively telling the truth. He sent me so much documentation that it was like I could have showed you everything. His old passport, his new passport, his military ID card, hotels, books, times, text messages, phone call logs with his wife.

It also, by the way, does provide an explanation for why they panicked when he just walked in there. because they were like, he should not have known that this building was here.

So that is extremely compelling. And like I said, having spoken to this individual who is planning to come out and do podcasts and speak about that, he's trying to figure it out, which I'm going to help him with this weekend to figure out who show he can go on and speak more. It's lining up like this is this is actually tracking. I had a sense when I spoke to him. that his memory could be trusted. Okay. He was very forthright. He was very honest. I mean, he was so honest. And he was like, when I said, oh, is it maybe this <span id="ent-person-captain-adam-neff-t-00-45-10"><a href="/entities/person-captain-adam-neff.md">Captain Neff</a></span>?

And he was like a hundred percent. That's the guy that questioned me. So I trust him. And by the way, his heart exploded when I, Told him about all the emails people that were in the military currently that are very moved by his story.

And that is just something that is really, that's why I said there's so much God in this, because like he either has the best or worst luck, but he just happens to be. in the wrong place at the right time, maybe in the right place at the wrong time, who knows, history will tell us. ^t-00-46-23

If your contact that you mentioned yesterday saw this group of men in the morning, it could line up well with this aircraft leaving at 11.43 a.m. on the 9th. From other searches I've done, it appears that <span id="ent-person-pam-bondi-t-00-46-55"><a href="/entities/person-pam-bondi.md">Pam Bondi</a></span> flew on this plane approximately five months ago from <span id="ent-gpe-tampa-t-00-46-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-tampa.md">Tampa</a></span> area back to DC.

I think we need to keep prodding this narrative of what happened and what he said that he saw. And he described it as a meeting that when the operation is being finalized, a finalization meeting, and he seems like he knows what he's speaking about. So that's what I have for you guys today. Oh wait, there's also something else about that plane. I gotta bring in Mark to mansplain it. I'll just bring you on Mark. I'm not even gonna tee you up there, just come on. Thank you. Thank you.

You can see it goes from <span id="ent-gpe-tucson-t-00-48-17"><a href="/entities/gpe-tucson.md">Tucson</a></span>, the transponder goes dark. That's what that that dash means there. But what really stood out to me were the call signs, which are basically the fourth column from the left. So you can see it's using RCH, which is Reach. That's a standard <span id="ent-org-united-states-air-force-t-00-48-17"><a href="/entities/org-united-states-air-force.md">Air Force</a></span> call sign designator. But when someone important is on the plane, it switches their call sign to SAM, which stands, as you said, for Special Air Mission, which is typically reserved for people like the vice president, cabinet secretaries, senior officials of the executive branch, congressional delegations, and other senior political leaders. ^t-00-48-17

But once it gets to <a href="/entities/gpe-fort-huachuca.md">Fort Huachuca</a> and takes off, it switches to SAM. So that tells me they picked up someone of that stature in <a href="/entities/gpe-fort-huachuca.md">Fort Huachuca</a>. And then just to avoid confusion, the Venus call sign is just when the plane is empty, it doesn't have anyone on it. It's actually very, very helpful. And I think, like I said, there's something here. There was definitely something here. And I do believe that God put that man again. He has the worst luck. Our guy, Harry, has the worst luck down, or the best luck down in <a href="/entities/gpe-fort-huachuca.md">Fort Huachuca</a>. I'm certainly glad he was there.

The top comment from yesterday is they want us to believe that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-55-24"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s neck was made of steel and the twin towers were made of neck bones. Got it. We're at that stage of a psychological operation. That's it. None of it's making sense. That is so well put. It is upside down land. Laughing Cats Music World writes, and thank you by the way, that's a massive donation, vital to separate flaws from race. We can criticize corrupt Jews without blanket anti-Semitism critiquing <span id="ent-person-george-floyd-t-00-55-24"><a href="/entities/person-george-floyd.md">George Floyd</a></span> because he died of fentanyl and the hospital isn't hating black people.

And then this person is making the joke, maybe <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-56-08"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake</a></span>. I didn't look into the <a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake</a> thing or why he left <span id="ent-org-fox-news-t-00-56-08"><a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a></span> because I'm just more interested in his military connections because that caught me by surprise. But you are absolutely on the money. Obviously, we can criticize people. And this sort of cheap tactic of being like, oh, it's kind of the same thing we're talking about. It's emotional manipulation. It's like, whoa, what are you saying? And it's like, no, there is corruption everywhere. And you are not removed from corruption because of who you work for, what you look like, what sex you are. It is always plausible and actually highly plausible, typically when money is involved. Lulu Mallory writes, the more I watch, the more fake and gay things are.

Well, I can tell you <a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a> are not doing that because I was the one who said I had the information about the <span id="ent-org-french-foreign-legion-t-00-56-52"><a href="/entities/org-french-foreign-legion.md">French Foreign Legion</a></span> being on the ground the day that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was assassinated and <a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a> have not reached out to me.

Meryl Gerstenmaier writes, it seems to me <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-58-14"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erica</a></span>'s moral outrage is manufactured more for an elite target audience as opposed to those normal folks who want to solve the actual murder. It does feel, I would say it feels elite. I don't have time for the little people. Okay. I don't have time for, you know, your small pocket donors. I got time, but like, it's going to be spent with power. It's going to be spent in the West wing. It's going to be spent raising $40 million at <span id="ent-org-mar-a-lago-t-00-58-14"><a href="/entities/org-mar-a-lago.md">Mar-a-Lago</a></span>.

That's what <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-58-55"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> was. It's not anymore, clearly, but it was a grassroots organization. That was the pitch. That was why I worked for them. The idea that you could get on the ground when nobody knew us, nobody knew me and <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-58-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, and we could get on stage and we could convince people of what we believed in.
