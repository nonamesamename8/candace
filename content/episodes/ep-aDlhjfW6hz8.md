I hope everyone has been having a good Friday. What are we gonna discuss today? Well, it has been going viral. Mere minutes after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> is shot, there are two men that look rather mysterious. They appear, they move his<a href="/events/event-2025-05-01-sarah-milgram-and-yaron-lechinsky-assassinated-in.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2025-05-01-sarah-milgram-and-yaron-lechinsky-assassinated-in-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-05-01-sarah-milgram-and-yaron-lechinsky-assassinated-in.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> chair, and they take down the camera that's directly, or was directly, behind his head. Why did they do that? Well, fortunately I was able to establish a connection with one of those individuals, and I was also able to see the footage with my own eyes. What I saw was very interesting, but what I didn't see was even more interesting. So let's jump right back into this. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-00-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=55" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, rare Friday episode. Gotta do a Friday episode here because this is just so important, and the vultures are circulating above, man. They are definitely insisting that we stop investigating this. I should first let you know that<span id="event-event-2025-09-19-u-s-senate-passes-bipartisan-resolution-designatin-t-00-00-55"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-19-u-s-senate-passes-bipartisan-resolution-designatin.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> the <span id="ent-org-us-senate-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/org-us-senate.md">Senate</a></span> has voted, and they have passed a bipartisan resolution to designate <span id="ent-date-october-14th-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/date-october-14th.md">October 14th</a></span>, which is <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s birthday, as <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> Remembrance Day. And I have to say, that is a very government maneuver. Like, we get a <span id="ent-person-martin-luther-king-jr-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/person-martin-luther-king-jr.md">Martin Luther King</a></span> Day. We've got <a href="/entities/person-martin-luther-king-jr.md">Martin Luther King</a> Boulevard. <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">John F. Kennedy</a></span> gets a library and a national day of mourning. But you know what? You know what I was thinking? ^t-00-00-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-01-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=97" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'd like to just find out who killed them all first. That's interesting to me. Who killed them? Before we give them a library, I'd like to know who did it. I think that's the best way for us to learn. The best way for us to remember is to study, right? That's what I learned in grade school. That's what we're doing right now. We're studying this and learning everything. Let's first address what many people have been emailing me, constantly asking me, "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-01-37"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, you gotta look into this. You gotta look into this. Look at these two strange men." We're gonna refer to this as Cambergate. It is Cambergate. And I wanna say this: shout out to all of the internet sleuths, the TikTokers, the YouTubers, those of you who are not playing around and you noticed this, because I did not in the beginning. ^t-00-01-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-02-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=142" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But yes, as I said, there's an individual who was first on the scene just after the shooting. He's like up on the rocks near the car that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-22"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> gets taken away in while he's being carried away. Let's take a look at that footage actually first. Let's look at that footage. And don't worry, there's no gore in this episode. It's difficult for me to even look at that sort of footage. Take a look. You can see <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s there. And one of you guys caught this. You probably didn't even see it there. And we can get in a little closer. Do you guys have it? Slow it down, or do you guys just want to circle here? Okay. ^t-00-02-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-03-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=183" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Right there. Right there, an individual standing there. Again, I am just amazed at the internet sleuths, as I was like, "Wow, that is very strange." That person appears to be calmly talking into their phone. It's like a circus around them. What's he doing? Who's he speaking to? Then just a couple of minutes afterward, that same individual appears alongside another individual, and he moves <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-03"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s chair. That's a crime scene. That's not good. And he moves it because he wants to stand on it as he takes down the cameras, or the camera, rather, that is just above <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s head. ^t-00-03-03

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-03-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=225" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That's the camera that I'm talking about on the right-hand side. That's the camera that I'm referring to. And we are going to now take a look at him, and he is also the individual, as many of you pointed out, that was near <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-45"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> just before the assassination. But let's check out that footage of him in the immediate aftermath, kind of switching around the cameras, the two of them. Take a look. ^t-00-03-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-04-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=260" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Safety team is here. I just heard them say, "Active shooter. <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> has been shot." <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> got hit—is what the security detail just said. Don't worry, guys. We're gonna get closer. ^t-00-04-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-05-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=313" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** This is just a wide shot so you can see what's going on here, and then we'll get a bit closer. I know you guys have pulled apart this footage a million ways, and thank you for that. And here's the closer version of that. You can see, slowed down here, he pulls out the<a href="/events/event-2025-09-19-jimmy-kimmel-pulled-off-air-indefinitely-over-comm.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2025-09-19-jimmy-kimmel-pulled-off-air-indefinitely-over-comm-t-00-05-13"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-19-jimmy-kimmel-pulled-off-air-indefinitely-over-comm.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> chair, he stands on it, and yes, that would be a big no-no for a crime scene. You don't move anything. He takes down the camera that is directly above where <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-13"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was sitting and would be able to provide therefore a lot of <span id="ent-org-insight-t-00-05-13"><a href="/entities/org-insight.md">insight</a></span>. And then you can see he kind of sets the camera onto the desk, and it looks like he removes the SIM card from it, or the SD card, if you will, which we're watching right here. ^t-00-05-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-05-49.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:49</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=349" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I'm going, "I'm going." When I saw this footage, "Who is that?" Like, actually, I should be able to figure this out because I've got a pretty big network at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-05-49"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. I was the person who's wearing shades. I don't recognize the individual. And I reach out to somebody on the inside, and I'm just like, "Who's this person?" ^t-00-05-49

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-06-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=393" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And they tell me the person's name, and I go, "Wait a second." And I look again. I'm like, "I know this person." It's been a few years, but I know this person. This person's been around <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-06-33"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> for quite some time, for years. Like I said, back when I was working at <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a>, early days. So I'm like, "I'm just gonna reach out." Obviously, I know this individual. I'm gonna reach out and I'm gonna say, "Hey, what's up with this?" Where is this footage? Why did you do this? What were you doing up there on the rocks? What's up? Like, this is not the first thing I would do if I had just witnessed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-33"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> being shot. And I'll say this right now: he was extremely forthcoming. Like, as soon as I reached out, I just sent a text because I still had his number, and he was extremely forthcoming—immediately got onto the phone. ^t-00-06-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-07-14.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:14</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=434" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And first and foremost, I should say, obviously he's seeing all of these clips going viral, and he is fearful for his family. He doesn't have any security, and people are looking, you know? And he said, "Look, as you can see in the footage, I was sitting right to the left of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-14"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> when <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> got shot." And I instantly knew that he was not going to be OK. I instantly knew that he was dead. And I then, like, as you can see, people that are running—anybody that was in that zone ran to the back. And he ^t-00-07-14

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-07-53.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:53</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=473" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** caught his breath. He wanted to check in with and communicate to other people that were working with and around <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-07-53"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. That's why he's on his phone, communicating to them what had happened. That's what he told me. Then I asked, "Okay, well, what about this camera thing?" Why would you grab the cameras? And he says, "Because the first thing that I thought was that I better secure the footage and be helpful and give that footage, hand that footage over to the feds." Well, obviously that's where things get into a pickle with me because we don't trust the feds. ^t-00-07-53

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-08-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=513" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm like, "No, we don't trust the feds, so we don't gotta do that." Just let me have the footage. I'm like, "Just send me the footage." Please let me look at it. There's a lot of conspiracies that are floating around right now. People don't know what to believe. People are doing very—what I would say—credible videos. People that certainly have the credibility are ballistics experts that are saying that what we see in the front is an exit wound, not an entry wound. I don't know one way or the other because I'm not an expert. I'm getting inundated with messages from people that hunt, people that are in the military, saying that this had to have come from another direction. This footage could help. As if nothing else, let me help you. ^t-00-08-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-09-18.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:18</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=558" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Let me formally debunk that by seeing this footage. Like, could you send this footage over to me? Well, he didn't want to send the footage over to me without checking with <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-09-18"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> lawyers. I said, "Look, technically, you own the footage." Like, you know, you and some other people own the footage. Like, let me just see the footage because why go through lawyers? Like, I just want to see the footage. And also, I asked the question, "Why not just release it?" We've already seen the worst thing that you could possibly see from the front, right? Like, the front is what is a traumatizing video. And I understand that he wants to spare his wife from having to experience that, <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-09-18"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. So many people watching the love of your life and the last second of their life—it's traumatizing. ^t-00-09-18

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-09-54.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:54</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=594" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm traumatized by it, right? That's not my husband, the father of my children. And so, out of a loyalty to <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-09-54"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>, he also doesn't want to give more footage to the internet. But I said, "Look, I'm not going to publish it." I just want to see it. And I think you should let me see that because people trust me. They know that I'm very serious about this. I don't care about anything right now other than figuring out who killed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-54"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>. So in the short run, he agrees that rather than send the footage, he will get onto a FaceTime call with me and he will show me the footage on his computer. ^t-00-09-54

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-10-36.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:36</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=636" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He did that, and I watched the footage, and I'm going to tell you what I saw. To the people specifically, the people that are in the military, people that know weapons, I'm telling you this because you might be able to add more color or more clarity here—what you would expect to see. If, given the weapon that they have said did this, the bullet they have said did this—I don't know anything about any of this, so I'm just telling you what I saw, okay? First and foremost, there is nothing gory about this shot at all. And so again, I am still going to work with him to get me the footage so that I think it should be shared. ^t-00-10-36

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-11-21.md" class="timestamp-link">00:11:21</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=681" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** There's nothing gory about this footage from the back. The thing that really stood out to me—and I just kept asking him to replay it over and over and over again—is that there's no blood. There's no blood from the back. There is no blood. So I think a lot of people were wondering whether or not that bullet pierced and went out the front. I think I vaguely even remember—and <span id="ent-person-skylar-t-00-11-21"><a href="/entities/person-skylar.md">Skylar</a></span>, you can maybe quickly look this up—but I thought the feds were saying they were looking for a bullet at some point, which is now very alarming to me. I don't understand that. How could they have been looking for a bullet? Because if I'm not seeing—and there isn't—I'm telling you, what happens in the front is not what happens in the back at all. ^t-00-11-21

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-12-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=725" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** If I'm not seeing any blood, what are we to take from that? The only thing that could make sense, if what they're saying is true and that person took the shot from the place that they are saying that individual took the shot from, it would suggest that it was inside of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-12-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, right? And they would know that. The feds would have known that. So they would have communicated that they were never looking for a bullet because, remember, one shot. So I'm very confused. I'm very confused not by what I saw, but what I didn't see. ^t-00-12-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-12-47.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:47</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=767" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay? That's pretty much all I can tell you right now. And I am going to try to get all of the footage. And I am—again, I understand that right now he is very fearful—but I am going to continue to try to privately push him to just release it. I believe that transparency is the only way. I'm much— I think all of us would agree. I have much more trust in the people than I do in the feds. The feds are lying about everything, so they should not be the only people that have access to this. And I understand not wanting to have that relived from another angle, but given the fact that there is no gore and there is no blood from this angle, I don't see why not. ^t-00-12-47

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-13-24.md" class="timestamp-link">00:13:24</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=804" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And so that's what I wanted to share with you guys. I know some of you guys were insinuating. I got a lot of emails that it could have been a flechette. I had to look that up. I don't even know what that is. I was like, "Guys, I don't know anything." Flechette shells—that something could have been a lot closer that hit him and that everything else could have been a distraction. All I can tell you is that there's no blood. That's it. There's no—there is no blood in that video. So give me your thoughts on that. Now I want to get to another tip that I received that is pretty interesting because look, as you guys know, when I began investigating this assassination, at no point did I ever speculate that ^t-00-13-24

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-14-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:14:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=846" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** any other country was involved and never speculated that <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israelis</a> were involved. So it was surprising, to say the least, that they're simply pretending that I did—pretending that I blamed <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-14-06"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, pretending that I said <span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-14-06"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></span> killed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-14-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>. It is now—like I said yesterday—it feels like they are trying to get ahead of something, like they know more than we know. I don't know why you would say something or accuse somebody of saying something that they didn't. I do believe that there is very clearly—we all believe there's very clearly—a government-level conspiracy that is involved. ^t-00-14-06

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-14-44.md" class="timestamp-link">00:14:44</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=884" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** There's no other way to assess those disastrous text messages—absolute disaster of a fed operation with those messages. Yesterday, I pretty casually mentioned to you guys something: that the doorbell cam footage, which TMZ happened upon somehow, was from a street upon which a ton of employees that work for <span id="ent-org-caldera-engineering-t-00-14-44"><a href="/entities/org-caldera-engineering.md">Caldera Engineering</a></span> live. We showed you—I think—one or two of those employees. The husband and wife I had mentioned worked for <a href="/entities/org-caldera-engineering.md">Caldera Engineering</a>, and it is a valves and pipes company. ^t-00-14-44

And I said this: I said, I know nothing about the valve industry. All I know is that every time I start investigating a government conspiracy or looking into people that are really shady like <span id="ent-person-harley-pasternak-t-00-15-25"><a href="/entities/person-harley-pasternak.md">Harley Pasternak</a></span>—thus far three people who I've investigated who oddly, either them or their families, had backgrounds working in this very niche valve and piping industry, like manufacturers of valves and pipes. Like, is everybody doing that? This is very strange. Well, many of you emailed me something that was quite surprising. ^t-00-15-25

And by niche, I mean that you asserted that it implies major government contracts, likely the <span id="ent-org-central-intelligence-agency-t-00-16-10"><a href="/entities/org-central-intelligence-agency.md">CIA</a></span>. Those of you who have worked at those industries telling me that there are even certain valves that are exclusively manufactured in <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-16-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, and that they tend to be involved in this. The government and the military tend to be involved in this. And that even, by the way, on Caldera's website, they noted that they have worked in <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a>. They have a map that they note every country that they have done engineering projects in. And one of them, or two dots, are in <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a>. ^t-00-16-10

And I'm just going to read you this email because maybe there are people at home who are just as ignorant as I am about government-level engineering, okay? This person wrote, "Hi <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-16-51"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, I wanted to share some detailed information regarding valves, piping and their relevance to critical infrastructure and intelligence communities. Valves as critical infrastructure assets. Modern industrial valves are used in pipelines, water treatment plants, power plants, and chemical facilities. They are often automated and networked, forming part of operational technology and SCADA systems. ^t-00-16-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-17-31.md" class="timestamp-link">00:17:31</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1051" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** This allows remote monitoring and control of the flow of gas, oil, water, and chemicals. Cybersecurity implications. These valves are part of systems that could be targeted for cyber attacks. Compromised valves can cause pipeline ruptures, water contamination, or industrial accidents. Because of this, intelligence and regulatory agencies—the CISA, NSA, PHMSA, FERC—monitor valve networks and may maintain trusted relationships with manufacturers and engineers to ensure security and resilience. Integration with above-ground systems. Modern valve networks can also integrate with cameras, sensors, alarms, and environmental monitoring. ^t-00-17-31

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-18-15.md" class="timestamp-link">00:18:15</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1095" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** This means that an operator could simultaneously monitor flow, view live video, and respond to alarms, which enhances both security and operational oversight. And strategic value for intelligence communities: knowledge of valve locations, models, and control systems provide <span id="ent-org-insight-t-00-18-15"><a href="/entities/org-insight.md">insight</a></span> into critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. Access to, or relationships with, manufacturers allows agencies to monitor, assess, and secure supply chains. Remote monitoring of valves and integrated systems can support emergency response simulations and national security exercises. And then they provide us with the real-world context by writing: companies like <span id="ent-org-caldera-engineering-t-00-18-15"><a href="/entities/org-caldera-engineering.md">Caldera Engineering</a></span> in <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-18-15"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-18-15"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>, manufacture specialized industrial valves and control systems. ^t-00-18-15

In short, valves themselves are simple mechanical devices, but when networked and embedded in critical infrastructure, they become strategically important for monitoring security and intelligence purposes." That just sounds right to me. That—I mean, I'm telling you—every story, I'm like, what is this person? It's like, are their families in valves? Like, I mean, I don't know anybody's family that did this. I don't know. Again, like, this is the kind of stuff that, like, we don't know, know, but we know. And that hit. And I feel like there is a bigger piece of this that involves Caldera. ^t-00-19-00

You'd be a fool not to see a government conspiracy here, especially with the way that I am being attacked for simply trying to investigate this. And the attacks are growing frantic.

I've always been kind to him. I have done nothing wrong to him.

And I have an idea about why all that may be. I'll tell you in just a second. First, I want to remind you guys about GNOLand because what if smart contract platforms were not controlled by the elites or big tech? What if they were built by and for real builders—you know, the people? That's the question that GNOLand asked, and that's why they built GNOLand. They started with Golang, which is a language real-world developers already use, and they built a new platform around it. It's transparent. It's intuitive, and it just makes sense. There's not some confusing system of ones and zeros. It's open source. ^t-00-20-25

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-21-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:21:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1266" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So imagine GitHub but designed for on-chain collaboration and composability. Builders actually get credit for their work, and they get rewarded. So every time that their code gets used—that's the real value. It's not likes. There's not clout; it's actual rewards. GNOLand rejected Proof of Stake, which is a system where the rich run the show. They went instead with Proof of Authority, a DAO where contributors—and not bad actors or Silicon Valley—actually call the shots. GNO.Land is open. It's fair, and honestly, it's pretty unstoppable.

I'm done playing defense. I'm not going to water down what I believe to be palatable because silence is not kindness at all. It's consent in many ways. And right now, the greatest silence is around the lives that are being ended before they take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like that. That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For just $28, that is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion.

Also telling you guys about the Wellness Company because it is flu season, which means that it's also flu shot season. After everything that we've been through over the last five years, the number of people getting flu shots is at a record low. I'm so grateful for that. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective at best, and that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from the Wellness Company. ^t-00-22-34

It's like having an urgent care clinic in your own home. I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from the Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line in an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. I simply open my kit, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and I get back to life.

Okay. All right. So let's get into how weird these headlines are getting. It's very strange. And I think we know why it's happening. We obviously know why it's happening, but even the publications that are usually not so blatant—because in order to be propaganda, you want to be effective, right? You gotta, like, lie a little and get people to believe you, not just do things that are just so nakedly deceptive that people go, okay, why am I even reading this publication?

It does feel so good to go everywhere in the world and to realize that there is awakening not just happening here. Let me tell you guys: it's happening all across the globe. People are starting to ask the hard questions. And you know you start getting close when they start to call you names. They instantly want to suggest that there's something wrong and there's something backwards about being <a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a> First. You're starting to hear the way they're framing that now. When you say you're <a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a> First, they'll ask you, what do you mean you're <a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a> First? Do you mean that you're an isolationist? Do you believe that we shouldn't have did what we did during World War II—all these things trying to pollute it? It's not that difficult. ^t-00-28-19

And yeah, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> got in trouble for the stuff that I said on stage. And then they came in and told that I was not allowed to speak at AmFest. The donors were making threats. But like, I went on tour with <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-29-16"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> last year. It's still on their website. It's so—this is like the strangest thing.

Quiet breakup? What are we—why are we doing this? It's very strange. Here's all the places that we went to last year.

So <a href="/entities/org-aipac.md">AIPAC</a> is pushing this. Right? The answer is implied by the people who are attacking me. They are all ultra-<span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-30-01"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span>, right? Like I said, the author of that article is an ultra-<a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a>. And here she is starting off <span id="ent-date-2018-t-00-30-01"><a href="/entities/date-2018.md">2018</a></span> in D.C., and she's got a picture of herself—if you can scroll down, I don't know if you can see this—like sitting in the audience in <a href="/entities/org-aipac.md">AIPAC</a>, and she's thrilled. <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-30-01"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-30-01"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>.

And I don't want to give mine up. But what these people are telling me is a very dark story that involves these donors, sponsors, influencers—a takeover of sorts that I think was happening right under <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s nose. And I want to say this formally as we keep investigating this. I believe that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-31-27"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> was betrayed by people who are close to him. Based on what I have seen—thus far the evidence, the quote-unquote "receipts"—that require a way deeper investigation into the apparatus, the financial apparatus at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-31-27"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span>, there was definitely some weird activity leading up to this moment happening at the organization. ^t-00-31-27

I have been given names, and I intend to now embark on this lengthier investigation, which I need more help on. I've reached out to some journalists. I'm sharing the information with them. And I think we're going to discover that this was ugly—uglier than we could have ever imagined, okay? There is a fear here that we are all perceiving—a desperation almost to end the investigation. The smears are becoming radical—radical. You can't just pretend <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-32-05"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> hasn't spoken to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-32-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> in years, but they're doing it, and they're trying to be convincing and shocked and putting this out. ^t-00-32-05

I mean, yesterday I released just one of many messages that I have with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, which prove that he was—in the months leading up to this—concerned about <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-32-45"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> and how <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a> was coming after our free speech. Free speech meant a lot to him, right? This message is from May. We can pull that back up, right? <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> sent me his tweet because after the assassination of <span id="ent-person-sarah-milgram-t-00-32-45"><a href="/entities/person-sarah-milgram.md">Sarah Milgram</a></span> and <span id="ent-person-yaron-lechinsky-t-00-32-45"><a href="/entities/person-yaron-lechinsky.md">Yaron Lechinsky</a></span> in D.C., people were calling for like hate speech laws, and <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> ^t-00-32-45

They had their lives ahead of them. But I must push back against one thing. And again, it was just the justification that this somehow meant that we had to get rid of free speech. You know, like it was suddenly like, oh, well, this happened. so now we need to say free speech is wrong. And so I wrote back to him, and I said, great tweet. And he gave prayer hands. And I said, speech censorship is coming to <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-33-27"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>. And he wrote back—as you can see, and the date here is May 22nd of this year— "It totally is." Okay. Me and <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-33-27"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span> and <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-33-27"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> are not lying to you. ^t-00-33-27

You can't criticize them at all, as <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-34-12"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span> said, before you start enduring threats. And what I have learned from the employees there is that back in May, <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-34-12"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> had some big changes—some odd changes, as they are describing it to me. Certain departments, people that were being fired, people that were told that they had to keep certain things a secret. Secret from whom? Secret from whom? Something is not right. Nothing we are being told is true.

It was a poster—Superman. I'll explain to you why that poster—that picture—is definitely not taken in July. First, I want to tell you guys about PureTalk because our society works because of the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment: free speech, okay? Even if I hate your speech, I want you to have it. Everyday Americans should be able to speak openly, and they should be able to speak honestly about family, their traditional values without any retribution—obviously. And that's the principle that PureTalk proudly supports. They sponsor my show, which allows me to stand strong behind the microphone every day and share truth with you guys. If you want to support brands that defend freedom and pro-American values, I encourage you to switch your wireless service to PureTalk. You are going to get great 5G coverage, an extremely reliable and secure network. And with plans from just $25 a month, you'll save a ton of money. ^t-00-47-09

So if you're a small business owner, you can save even more while enjoying white glove service. Stand with companies who share your values. Go to puretalk.com/Owens to switch to my wireless company, PureTalk. Right now, you will save an additional 50% off your first month. Again, visit puretalk.com/Owens to make the switch today. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing because if you have been living on credit cards just to cover groceries, gas, and bills, you know those interest rates are absolutely brutal. Why keep paying 20% or more to the banks when you could just call my friends at American Financing? Because they have mortgage rates right now that are in the fives, and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pocket and out of the hands of credit card companies. Right now, American Financing is helping homeowners save an average of about $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high-interest debt. And there are no upfront fees, no obligations. ^t-00-47-50

First, I want to tell you guys: Dairy Queen photo—some of you guys noticed that there was this old Superman poster, and that Superman in the background there—that poster—you said they removed those ads back in June or July. You are correct. That's when that movie came out, and that's when they were scheduled to remove those ads. But rest assured—first and foremost, for two reasons—that that is not—definitely it's not—footage from July. July—just so you guys understand—there is not a place in the world that would have the bandwidth to keep 24-hour footage inside of their restaurant dating back months. It auto-deletes. I think the footage at my house—because we have cameras absolutely everywhere— I think it's every 48 hours, every 72 hours. I think the highest you might see that is one week. This is absolutely... By the way, how would that person have known to go back to July? ^t-00-49-16

I think I one time saw that person in July eating something here. Let's go back and scrub—like, that's just—that definitely did not happen. The source we had was very solid. It was very specific. And also saying that they threw away clothes in the nearby cemetery was very specific. This person was very confident when they shared it. But also something else that lets you date it—to pull back up that photo— is behind—right—their advertising "available now." What that actually is is a—and I gotta remember the name of it. It's—I don't know why I didn't write it down. It's a maple leaf blizzard thing. It's maple leaf something. That dropped, and they began using those advertisements for that drink on August 31st. ^t-00-49-57
