I hope everyone has been having a good Friday. What are we gonna discuss today? Well, it has been going viral. Mere minutes after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> is shot, there are two men that look rather mysterious. They appear, they move his<a href="/events/event-2025-05-01-sarah-milgram-and-yaron-lechinsky-assassinated-in.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2025-05-01-sarah-milgram-and-yaron-lechinsky-assassinated-in-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-05-01-sarah-milgram-and-yaron-lechinsky-assassinated-in.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> chair, and they take down the camera that's directly, or was directly, behind his head. Why did they do that? Well, fortunately I was able to establish a connection with one of those individuals, and I was also able to see the footage with my own eyes. What I saw was very interesting, but what I didn't see was even more interesting. So let's jump right back into this. Welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-00-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=55" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, rare Friday episode. Gotta do a Friday episode here because this is just so important, and the vultures are circulating above, man. They are definitely insisting that we stop investigating this. <span id="claim-claim-c2782dc5ac6e-t-00-00-55">I should first let you know that the Senate has voted, and they have passed a bipartisan resolution to designate <span id="ent-date-october-14th-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/date-october-14th.md">October 14th</a></span>, which is <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s birthday, as <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> Remembrance Day.<a href="/claims/claim-c2782dc5ac6e.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> And I have to say, that is a very government maneuver. Like, we get a <span id="ent-person-martin-luther-king-jr-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/person-martin-luther-king-jr.md">Martin Luther King</a></span> Day. We've got <a href="/entities/person-martin-luther-king-jr.md">Martin Luther King</a> Boulevard. <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">John F. Kennedy</a></span> gets a library and a national day of mourning. But you know what? You know what I was thinking? ^t-00-00-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-01-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=97" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'd like to just find out who killed them all first. That's interesting to me. Who killed them? Before we give them a library, I'd like to know who did it. I think that's the best way for us to learn. The best way for us to remember is to study, right? That's what I learned in grade school. That's what we're doing right now. We're studying this and learning everything. Let's first address what many people have been emailing me, constantly asking me, "Candace, you gotta look into this. You gotta look into this. Look at these two strange men." We're gonna refer to this as Cambergate. It is Cambergate. And I wanna say this: shout out to all of the internet sleuths, the TikTokers, the YouTubers, those of you who are not playing around and you noticed this, because I did not in the beginning. ^t-00-01-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-02-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=142" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But yes, as I said, there's an individual who was first on the scene just after the shooting. He's like up on the rocks near the car that Charlie gets taken away in while he's being carried away. Let's take a look at that footage actually first. Let's look at that footage. And don't worry, there's no gore in this episode. It's difficult for me to even look at that sort of footage. Take a look. You can see Charlie's there. And one of you guys caught this. You probably didn't even see it there. And we can get in a little closer. Do you guys have it? Slow it down, or do you guys just want to circle here? Okay. ^t-00-02-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-03-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=183" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Right there. Right there, an individual standing there. Again, I am just amazed at the internet sleuths, as I was like, "Wow, that is very strange." That person appears to be calmly talking into their phone. It's like a circus around them. What's he doing? Who's he speaking to? Then just a couple of minutes afterward, that same individual appears alongside another individual, and he moves Charlie's chair. That's a crime scene. That's not good. <span id="claim-claim-8d4e9fed9174-t-00-03-03">And he moves it because he wants to stand on it as he takes down the cameras, or the camera, rather, that is just above Charlie's head.<a href="/claims/claim-8d4e9fed9174.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> ^t-00-03-03

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-03-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=225" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That's the camera that I'm talking about on the right-hand side. That's the camera that I'm referring to. And we are going to now take a look at him, and he is also the individual, as many of you pointed out, that was near Charlie just before the assassination. But let's check out that footage of him in the immediate aftermath, kind of switching around the cameras, the two of them. Take a look. ^t-00-03-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-04-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=260" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Safety team is here. I just heard them say, "Active shooter. <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> has been shot." <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> got hit—is what the security detail just said. Don't worry, guys. We're gonna get closer. ^t-00-04-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-05-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=313" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** This is just a wide shot so you can see what's going on here, and then we'll get a bit closer. I know you guys have pulled apart this footage a million ways, and thank you for that. And here's the closer version of that. You can see, slowed down here, he pulls out the<a href="/events/event-2025-09-19-jimmy-kimmel-pulled-off-air-indefinitely-over-comm.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2025-09-19-jimmy-kimmel-pulled-off-air-indefinitely-over-comm-t-00-05-13"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-19-jimmy-kimmel-pulled-off-air-indefinitely-over-comm.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> chair, he stands on it, and yes, that would be a big no-no for a crime scene. You don't move anything. <span id="claim-claim-8a921098035d-t-00-05-13">He takes down the camera that is directly above where Charlie was sitting and would be able to provide therefore a lot of <span id="ent-org-insight-t-00-05-13"><a href="/entities/org-insight.md">insight</a></span>.<a href="/claims/claim-8a921098035d.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> And then you can see he kind of sets the camera onto the desk, and it looks like he removes the SIM card from it, or the SD card, if you will, which we're watching right here. ^t-00-05-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-05-49.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:49</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=349" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I'm going, "I'm going." When I saw this footage, "Who is that?" Like, actually, I should be able to figure this out because I've got a pretty big network at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-05-49"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. I was the person who's wearing shades. I don't recognize the individual. And I reach out to somebody on the inside, and I'm just like, "Who's this person?" ^t-00-05-49

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-06-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=393" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And they tell me the person's name, and I go, "Wait a second." And I look again. I'm like, "I know this person." It's been a few years, but I know this person. <span id="claim-claim-755d916026ab-t-00-06-33">This person's been around <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-06-33"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> for quite some time, for years.<a href="/claims/claim-755d916026ab.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> Like I said, back when I was working at <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a>, early days. So I'm like, "I'm just gonna reach out." Obviously, I know this individual. I'm gonna reach out and I'm gonna say, "Hey, what's up with this?" Where is this footage? Why did you do this? What were you doing up there on the rocks? What's up? Like, this is not the first thing I would do if I had just witnessed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-33"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> being shot. And I'll say this right now: he was extremely forthcoming. Like, as soon as I reached out, I just sent a text because I still had his number, and he was extremely forthcoming—immediately got onto the phone. ^t-00-06-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-07-14.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:14</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=434" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And first and foremost, I should say, obviously he's seeing all of these clips going viral, and he is fearful for his family. He doesn't have any security, and people are looking, you know? <span id="claim-claim-944aad3d0c88-t-00-07-14">And he said, "Look, as you can see in the footage, I was sitting right to the left of Charlie when Charlie got shot.<a href="/claims/claim-944aad3d0c88.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>" And I instantly knew that he was not going to be OK. I instantly knew that he was dead. And I then, like, as you can see, people that are running—anybody that was in that zone ran to the back. And he ^t-00-07-14

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-07-53.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:53</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=473" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** caught his breath. He wanted to check in with and communicate to other people that were working with and around <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-07-53"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. That's why he's on his phone, communicating to them what had happened. That's what he told me. Then I asked, "Okay, well, what about this camera thing?" Why would you grab the cameras? <span id="claim-claim-fe90871866b0-t-00-07-53">And he says, "Because the first thing that I thought was that I better secure the footage and be helpful and give that footage, hand that footage over to the feds.<a href="/claims/claim-fe90871866b0.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>" Well, obviously that's where things get into a pickle with me because we don't trust the feds. ^t-00-07-53

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-08-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=513" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm like, "No, we don't trust the feds, so we don't gotta do that." Just let me have the footage. I'm like, "Just send me the footage." Please let me look at it. There's a lot of conspiracies that are floating around right now. People don't know what to believe. People are doing very—what I would say—credible videos. <span id="claim-claim-1d010908a898-t-00-08-33">People that certainly have the credibility are ballistics experts that are saying that what we see in the front is an exit wound, not an entry wound.<a href="/claims/claim-1d010908a898.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> I don't know one way or the other because I'm not an expert. I'm getting inundated with messages from people that hunt, people that are in the military, saying that this had to have come from another direction. This footage could help. As if nothing else, let me help you. ^t-00-08-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-09-18.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:18</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=558" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Let me formally debunk that by seeing this footage. Like, could you send this footage over to me? Well, he didn't want to send the footage over to me without checking with <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-09-18"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> lawyers. I said, "Look, technically, you own the footage." Like, you know, you and some other people own the footage. Like, let me just see the footage because why go through lawyers? Like, I just want to see the footage. And also, I asked the question, "Why not just release it?" We've already seen the worst thing that you could possibly see from the front, right? Like, the front is what is a traumatizing video. And I understand that he wants to spare his wife from having to experience that, <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-09-18"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. So many people watching the love of your life and the last second of their life—it's traumatizing. ^t-00-09-18

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-09-54.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:54</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=594" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm traumatized by it, right? That's not my husband, the father of my children. And so, out of a loyalty to <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-09-54"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>, he also doesn't want to give more footage to the internet. But I said, "Look, I'm not going to publish it." I just want to see it. And I think you should let me see that because people trust me. They know that I'm very serious about this. I don't care about anything right now other than figuring out who killed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-54"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>. So in the short run, he agrees that rather than send the footage, he will get onto a FaceTime call with me and he will show me the footage on his computer. ^t-00-09-54

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-10-36.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:36</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=636" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He did that, and I watched the footage, and I'm going to tell you what I saw. To the people specifically, the people that are in the military, people that know weapons, I'm telling you this because you might be able to add more color or more clarity here—what you would expect to see. If, given the weapon that they have said did this, the bullet they have said did this—I don't know anything about any of this, so I'm just telling you what I saw, okay? <span id="claim-claim-98744c0e7a2e-t-00-10-36">First and foremost, there is nothing gory about this shot at all.<a href="/claims/claim-98744c0e7a2e.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> And so again, I am still going to work with him to get me the footage so that I think it should be shared. ^t-00-10-36

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-11-21.md" class="timestamp-link">00:11:21</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=681" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="claim-claim-305b15b4f845-t-00-11-21">There's nothing gory about this footage from the back<a href="/claims/claim-305b15b4f845.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. The thing that really stood out to me—and I just kept asking him to replay it over and over and over again—is that there's no blood. There's no blood from the back. <span id="claim-claim-0be2ebcfa653-t-00-11-21">There is no blood.<a href="/claims/claim-0be2ebcfa653.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> So I think a lot of people were wondering whether or not that bullet pierced and went out the front. <span id="claim-claim-4fe4a5bff739-t-00-11-21">I think I vaguely even remember—and Skylar, you can maybe quickly look this up—but I thought the feds were saying they were looking for a bullet at some point, which is now very alarming to me.<a href="/claims/claim-4fe4a5bff739.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> I don't understand that. How could they have been looking for a bullet? Because if I'm not seeing—and there isn't—I'm telling you, what happens in the front is not what happens in the back at all. ^t-00-11-21

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-12-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=725" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** If I'm not seeing any blood, what are we to take from that? The only thing that could make sense, if what they're saying is true and that person took the shot from the place that they are saying that individual took the shot from, it would suggest that it was inside of Charlie, right? And they would know that. The feds would have known that. So they would have communicated that they were never looking for a bullet because, remember, one shot. So I'm very confused. I'm very confused not by what I saw, but what I didn't see. ^t-00-12-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-12-47.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:47</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=767" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay? That's pretty much all I can tell you right now. And I am going to try to get all of the footage. And I am—again, I understand that right now he is very fearful—but I am going to continue to try to privately push him to just release it. I believe that transparency is the only way. I'm much— I think all of us would agree. I have much more trust in the people than I do in the feds. The feds are lying about everything, so they should not be the only people that have access to this. And I understand not wanting to have that relived from another angle, but given the fact that there is no gore and there is no blood from this angle, I don't see why not. ^t-00-12-47

I know some of you guys were insinuating. I got a lot of emails that it could have been a flechette. I had to look that up. I don't even know what that is. I was like, "Guys, I don't know anything." Flechette shells—that something could have been a lot closer that hit him and that everything else could have been a distraction. All I can tell you is that there's no blood. That's it. There's no—there is no blood in that video. So give me your thoughts on that. Now I want to get to another tip that I received that is pretty interesting because look, as you guys know, when I began investigating this assassination, at no point did I ever speculate that ^t-00-13-24

And I'm just going to read you this email because maybe there are people at home who are just as ignorant as I am about government-level engineering, okay? This person wrote, "Hi Candace, I wanted to share some detailed information regarding valves, piping and their relevance to critical infrastructure and intelligence communities. Valves as critical infrastructure assets. Modern industrial valves are used in pipelines, water treatment plants, power plants, and chemical facilities. They are often automated and networked, forming part of operational technology and SCADA systems. ^t-00-16-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-17-31.md" class="timestamp-link">00:17:31</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1051" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** This allows remote monitoring and control of the flow of gas, oil, water, and chemicals. Cybersecurity implications. These valves are part of systems that could be targeted for cyber attacks. Compromised valves can cause pipeline ruptures, water contamination, or industrial accidents. Because of this, intelligence and regulatory agencies—the CISA, NSA, PHMSA, FERC—monitor valve networks and may maintain trusted relationships with manufacturers and engineers to ensure security and resilience. Integration with above-ground systems. Modern valve networks can also integrate with cameras, sensors, alarms, and environmental monitoring. ^t-00-17-31

And strategic value for intelligence communities: knowledge of valve locations, models, and control systems provide <span id="ent-org-insight-t-00-18-15"><a href="/entities/org-insight.md">insight</a></span> into critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. Access to, or relationships with, manufacturers allows agencies to monitor, assess, and secure supply chains. Remote monitoring of valves and integrated systems can support emergency response simulations and national security exercises. And then they provide us with the real-world context by writing: companies like <span id="ent-org-caldera-engineering-t-00-18-15"><a href="/entities/org-caldera-engineering.md">Caldera Engineering</a></span> in <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-18-15"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-18-15"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>, manufacture specialized industrial valves and control systems. ^t-00-18-15

In short, valves themselves are simple mechanical devices, but when networked and embedded in critical infrastructure, they become strategically important for monitoring security and intelligence purposes." That just sounds right to me. That—I mean, I'm telling you—every story, I'm like, what is this person? It's like, are their families in valves? Like, I mean, I don't know anybody's family that did this. I don't know. Again, like, this is the kind of stuff that, like, we don't know, know, but we know. And that hit.

And I have an idea about why all that may be. I'll tell you in just a second. First, I want to remind you guys about GNOLand because what if smart contract platforms were not controlled by the elites or big tech? What if they were built by and for real builders—you know, the people? That's the question that GNOLand asked, and that's why they built GNOLand. They started with Golang, which is a language real-world developers already use, and they built a new platform around it. It's transparent. It's intuitive, and it just makes sense. There's not some confusing system of ones and zeros. It's open source. ^t-00-20-25

Builders actually get credit for their work, and they get rewarded. So every time that their code gets used—that's the real value. It's not likes. There's not clout; it's actual rewards. GNOLand rejected Proof of Stake, which is a system where the rich run the show. They went instead with Proof of Authority, a DAO where contributors—and not bad actors or Silicon Valley—actually call the shots. GNO.Land is open. It's fair, and honestly, it's pretty unstoppable. So if you are a builder, a freedom lover, or just tired of rigged platforms, please check it out over at GNO.Land/Candace. Again, that's GNO.Land/Candace.

I'm done playing defense. I'm not going to water down what I believe to be palatable because silence is not kindness at all. It's consent in many ways. And right now, the greatest silence is around the lives that are being ended before they take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like that. That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For just $28, that is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion.

We must save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel. Again, that is <a href="/entities/org-preborn.md">preborn</a>.org/Candace to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also telling you guys about the Wellness Company because it is flu season, which means that it's also flu shot season. After everything that we've been through over the last five years, the number of people getting flu shots is at a record low. I'm so grateful for that. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective at best, and that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from the Wellness Company. ^t-00-22-34

It's like having an urgent care clinic in your own home. I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from the Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line in an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. I simply open my kit, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and I get back to life. This kit is literally a lifesaver, with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who have had the kit ready in a time of need.

It does feel so good to go everywhere in the world and to realize that there is awakening not just happening here. Let me tell you guys: it's happening all across the globe. People are starting to ask the hard questions. And you know you start getting close when they start to call you names. They instantly want to suggest that there's something wrong and there's something backwards about being America First. You're starting to hear the way they're framing that now. When you say you're America First, they'll ask you, what do you mean you're America First? Do you mean that you're an isolationist?

First, I want to tell you guys about PureTalk because our society works because of the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment: free speech, okay? Even if I hate your speech, I want you to have it. Everyday Americans should be able to speak openly, and they should be able to speak honestly about family, their traditional values without any retribution—obviously. And that's the principle that PureTalk proudly supports. They sponsor my show, which allows me to stand strong behind the microphone every day and share truth with you guys. If you want to support brands that defend freedom and pro-American values, I encourage you to switch your wireless service to PureTalk. You are going to get great 5G coverage, an extremely reliable and secure network. And with plans from just $25 a month, you'll save a ton of money. ^t-00-47-09

So if you're a small business owner, you can save even more while enjoying white glove service. Stand with companies who share your values. Go to puretalk.com/Owens to switch to my wireless company, PureTalk. Right now, you will save an additional 50% off your first month. Again, visit puretalk.com/Owens to make the switch today. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing because if you have been living on credit cards just to cover groceries, gas, and bills, you know those interest rates are absolutely brutal. Why keep paying 20% or more to the banks when you could just call my friends at American Financing? Because they have mortgage rates right now that are in the fives, and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pocket and out of the hands of credit card companies. Right now, American Financing is helping homeowners save an average of about $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high-interest debt.

There's also another kicker. If you start today, you could delay two mortgage payments, which puts even more cash in your hands right away. So don't wait. Call American Financing right now. The number's 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or you can visit americanfinancing.net/Owens. Again, that's americanfinancing.net/Owens. ^t-00-48-33

First, I want to tell you guys: Dairy Queen photo—some of you guys noticed that there was this old Superman poster, and that Superman in the background there—that poster—you said they removed those ads back in June or July. You are correct. That's when that movie came out, and that's when they were scheduled to remove those ads. But rest assured—first and foremost, for two reasons—that that is not—definitely it's not—footage from July. July—just so you guys understand—there is not a place in the world that would have the bandwidth to keep 24-hour footage inside of their restaurant dating back months. It auto-deletes. I think the footage at my house—because we have cameras absolutely everywhere— I think it's every 48 hours, every 72 hours. I think the highest you might see that is one week. This is absolutely... By the way, how would that person have known to go back to July? ^t-00-49-16

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-49-57.md" class="timestamp-link">00:49:57</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=2997" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Could you imagine having to scroll the footage? I think I one time saw that person in July eating something here. Let's go back and scrub—like, that's just—that definitely did not happen. The source we had was very solid. It was very specific. And also saying that they threw away clothes in the nearby cemetery was very specific. This person was very confident when they shared it. But also something else that lets you date it—to pull back up that photo— is behind—right—their advertising "available now." What that actually is is a—and I gotta remember the name of it. It's—I don't know why I didn't write it down. It's a maple leaf blizzard thing. It's maple leaf something. <span id="claim-claim-40268eced4ca-t-00-49-57">That dropped, and they began using those advertisements for that drink on August 31st.<a href="/claims/claim-40268eced4ca.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> ^t-00-49-57

And that's if they put up that advertisement immediately. Yes, the maple cookie shake. That's what it was. They began advertising on August 31st. So it's not from July. ^t-00-50-39

And we are taking a look at everything. You guys have sent me so much more, by the way, which I'm going to get into this weekend in memorial of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-51-24"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>—about the house next door, some weird stuff that was happening at that house, what has been advertised at that vacant house where the locals believe that's the real place that they should have went to. <span id="claim-claim-8a45fd14e977-t-00-51-24">People are telling me a lot of stuff about CIA action at <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-51-24"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span>, some programs that they had been running—that there's a pipeline from people at <a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a> to people that go and work for the CIA.<a href="/claims/claim-8a45fd14e977.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> So there's a lot to investigate, but I also want to be given the time to fact-check everything so that we don't go after the wrong people. Again, if you have any tips, any photos, you know where to send them. Candace, I mean, that's not right. Don't send it there. Tips@candaceowens.com. And yeah, for those of you guys who have supported this, thank you so much. Like I said yesterday and the day before, we see you in the comments fighting for us. And I will say it is a good thing they're attacking this hard. It's actually waking more people up. People are watching my show, watching them lie, debunking their lies and going, okay, why did they do that? Like, why would PBD do that? Like, we've always been friends—friendly. He was very kind to me. I've always been kind to him. Why just allow these people to lie? ^t-00-51-24
