I hope everyone has been having a good Friday. What are we gonna discuss today? Well, it has been going viral. Mere minutes after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is shot, there are two men that look rather mysterious. They appear, they move his chair, and they take down the camera that's directly, or was directly, behind his head. Why did they do that? Well, fortunately I was able to establish a connection with one of those individuals, and I was also able to see the footage with my own eyes. What I saw was very interesting, but what I didn't see was even more interesting. So let's jump right back into this. Welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=55" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-00-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, rare Friday episode. Gotta do a Friday episode here because this is just so important, and the vultures are circulating above, man. They are definitely insisting that we stop investigating this. I should first let you know that the Senate has voted, and they have passed a bipartisan resolution to designate October 14th, which is Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s birthday, as Charlie Kirk Remembrance Day. And I have to say, that is a very government maneuver. Like, we get a Martin Luther King Day. We've got Martin Luther King Boulevard. John F. Kennedy gets a library and a national day of mourning. But you know what? You know what I was thinking? ^t-00-00-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=97" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-01-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I'd like to just find out who killed them all first. That's interesting to me. Who killed them? Before we give them a library, I'd like to know who did it. I think that's the best way for us to learn. The best way for us to remember is to study, right? That's what I learned in grade school. That's what we're doing right now. We're studying this and learning everything. Let's first address what many people have been emailing me, constantly asking me, "Candace, you gotta look into this. You gotta look into this. Look at these two strange men." We're gonna refer to this as Cambergate. It is Cambergate. And I wanna say this: shout out to all of the internet sleuths, the TikTokers, the YouTubers, those of you who are not playing around and you noticed this, because I did not in the beginning. ^t-00-01-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=142" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-02-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** But yes, as I said, there's an individual who was first on the scene just after the shooting. He's like up on the rocks near the car that Charlie gets taken away in while he's being carried away. Let's take a look at that footage actually first. Let's look at that footage. And don't worry, there's no gore in this episode. It's difficult for me to even look at that sort of footage. Take a look. You can see Charlie's there. And one of you guys caught this. You probably didn't even see it there. And we can get in a little closer. Do you guys have it? Slow it down, or do you guys just want to circle here? Okay. ^t-00-02-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=183" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-03-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Right there. Right there, an individual standing there. Again, I am just amazed at the internet sleuths, as I was like, "Wow, that is very strange." That person appears to be calmly talking into their phone. It's like a circus around them. What's he doing? Who's he speaking to? Then just a couple of minutes afterward, that same individual appears alongside another individual, and he moves Charlie's chair. That's a crime scene. That's not good. And he moves it because he wants to stand on it as he takes down the cameras, or the camera, rather, that is just above Charlie's head. ^t-00-03-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=225" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-03-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** That's the camera that I'm talking about on the right-hand side. That's the camera that I'm referring to. And we are going to now take a look at him, and he is also the individual, as many of you pointed out, that was near Charlie just before the assassination. But let's check out that footage of him in the immediate aftermath, kind of switching around the cameras, the two of them. Take a look. ^t-00-03-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=260" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-04-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Safety team is here. I just heard them say, "Active shooter. Charlie Kirk has been shot." Charlie Kirk got hit—is what the security detail just said. Don't worry, guys. We're gonna get closer. ^t-00-04-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=313" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-05-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** This is just a wide shot so you can see what's going on here, and then we'll get a bit closer. I know you guys have pulled apart this footage a million ways, and thank you for that. And here's the closer version of that. You can see, slowed down here, he pulls out the chair, he stands on it, and yes, that would be a big no-no for a crime scene. You don't move anything. He takes down the camera that is directly above where Charlie was sitting and would be able to provide therefore a lot of insight. And then you can see he kind of sets the camera onto the desk, and it looks like he removes the SIM card from it, or the SD card, if you will, which we're watching right here. ^t-00-05-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=349" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-05-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So I'm going, "I'm going." When I saw this footage, "Who is that?" Like, actually, I should be able to figure this out because I've got a pretty big network at Turning Point USA. I was the person who's wearing shades. I don't recognize the individual. And I reach out to somebody on the inside, and I'm just like, "Who's this person?" ^t-00-05-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=393" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-06-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And they tell me the person's name, and I go, "Wait a second." And I look again. I'm like, "I know this person." It's been a few years, but I know this person. This person's been around Turning Point for quite some time, for years. Like I said, back when I was working at Turning Point, early days. So I'm like, "I'm just gonna reach out." Obviously, I know this individual. I'm gonna reach out and I'm gonna say, "Hey, what's up with this?" Where is this footage? Why did you do this? What were you doing up there on the rocks? What's up? Like, this is not the first thing I would do if I had just witnessed Charlie Kirk being shot. And I'll say this right now: he was extremely forthcoming. Like, as soon as I reached out, I just sent a text because I still had his number, and he was extremely forthcoming—immediately got onto the phone. ^t-00-06-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=434" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-07-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And first and foremost, I should say, obviously he's seeing all of these clips going viral, and he is fearful for his family. He doesn't have any security, and people are looking, you know? And he said, "Look, as you can see in the footage, I was sitting right to the left of Charlie when Charlie got shot." And I instantly knew that he was not going to be OK. I instantly knew that he was dead. And I then, like, as you can see, people that are running—anybody that was in that zone ran to the back. And he ^t-00-07-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=473" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-07-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** caught his breath. He wanted to check in with and communicate to other people that were working with and around Turning Point USA. That's why he's on his phone, communicating to them what had happened. That's what he told me. Then I asked, "Okay, well, what about this camera thing?" Why would you grab the cameras? And he says, "Because the first thing that I thought was that I better secure the footage and be helpful and give that footage, hand that footage over to the feds." Well, obviously that's where things get into a pickle with me because we don't trust the feds. ^t-00-07-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=513" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-08-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm like, "No, we don't trust the feds, so we don't gotta do that." Just let me have the footage. I'm like, "Just send me the footage." Please let me look at it. There's a lot of conspiracies that are floating around right now. People don't know what to believe. People are doing very—what I would say—credible videos. People that certainly have the credibility are ballistics experts that are saying that what we see in the front is an exit wound, not an entry wound. I don't know one way or the other because I'm not an expert. I'm getting inundated with messages from people that hunt, people that are in the military, saying that this had to have come from another direction. This footage could help. As if nothing else, let me help you. ^t-00-08-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=558" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-09-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Let me formally debunk that by seeing this footage. Like, could you send this footage over to me? Well, he didn't want to send the footage over to me without checking with Turning Point lawyers. I said, "Look, technically, you own the footage." Like, you know, you and some other people own the footage. Like, let me just see the footage because why go through lawyers? Like, I just want to see the footage. And also, I asked the question, "Why not just release it?" We've already seen the worst thing that you could possibly see from the front, right? Like, the front is what is a traumatizing video. And I understand that he wants to spare his wife from having to experience that, Erika (Erika Kirk). So many people watching the love of your life and the last second of their life—it's traumatizing. ^t-00-09-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=594" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-09-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm traumatized by it, right? That's not my husband, the father of my children. And so, out of a loyalty to Erika (Erika Kirk), he also doesn't want to give more footage to the internet. But I said, "Look, I'm not going to publish it." I just want to see it. And I think you should let me see that because people trust me. They know that I'm very serious about this. I don't care about anything right now other than figuring out who killed Charlie Kirk. So in the short run, he agrees that rather than send the footage, he will get onto a FaceTime call with me and he will show me the footage on his computer. ^t-00-09-54

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=636" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-10-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** He did that, and I watched the footage, and I'm going to tell you what I saw. To the people specifically, the people that are in the military, people that know weapons, I'm telling you this because you might be able to add more color or more clarity here—what you would expect to see. If, given the weapon that they have said did this, the bullet they have said did this—I don't know anything about any of this, so I'm just telling you what I saw, okay? First and foremost, there is nothing gory about this shot at all. And so again, I am still going to work with him to get me the footage so that I think it should be shared. ^t-00-10-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=681" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-11-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** There's nothing gory about this footage from the back. The thing that really stood out to me—and I just kept asking him to replay it over and over and over again—is that there's no blood. There's no blood from the back. There is no blood. So I think a lot of people were wondering whether or not that bullet pierced and went out the front. I think I vaguely even remember—and Skylar, you can maybe quickly look this up—but I thought the feds were saying they were looking for a bullet at some point, which is now very alarming to me. I don't understand that. How could they have been looking for a bullet? Because if I'm not seeing—and there isn't—I'm telling you, what happens in the front is not what happens in the back at all. ^t-00-11-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=725" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-12-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** If I'm not seeing any blood, what are we to take from that? The only thing that could make sense, if what they're saying is true and that person took the shot from the place that they are saying that individual took the shot from, it would suggest that it was inside of Charlie, right? And they would know that. The feds would have known that. So they would have communicated that they were never looking for a bullet because, remember, one shot. So I'm very confused. I'm very confused not by what I saw, but what I didn't see. ^t-00-12-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=767" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-12-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay? That's pretty much all I can tell you right now. And I am going to try to get all of the footage. And I am—again, I understand that right now he is very fearful—but I am going to continue to try to privately push him to just release it. I believe that transparency is the only way. I'm much— I think all of us would agree. I have much more trust in the people than I do in the feds. The feds are lying about everything, so they should not be the only people that have access to this. And I understand not wanting to have that relived from another angle, but given the fact that there is no gore and there is no blood from this angle, I don't see why not. ^t-00-12-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=804" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-13-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And so that's what I wanted to share with you guys. I know some of you guys were insinuating. I got a lot of emails that it could have been a flechette. I had to look that up. I don't even know what that is. I was like, "Guys, I don't know anything." Flechette shells—that something could have been a lot closer that hit him and that everything else could have been a distraction. All I can tell you is that there's no blood. That's it. There's no—there is no blood in that video. So give me your thoughts on that. Now I want to get to another tip that I received that is pretty interesting because look, as you guys know, when I began investigating this assassination, at no point did I ever speculate that ^t-00-13-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=846" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-14-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** any other country was involved and never speculated that Israelis were involved. So it was surprising, to say the least, that they're simply pretending that I did—pretending that I blamed Israel, pretending that I said Benjamin Netanyahu killed Charlie Kirk. It is now—like I said yesterday—it feels like they are trying to get ahead of something, like they know more than we know. I don't know why you would say something or accuse somebody of saying something that they didn't. I do believe that there is very clearly—we all believe there's very clearly—a government-level conspiracy that is involved. ^t-00-14-06

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=884" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-14-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** There's no other way to assess those disastrous text messages—absolute disaster of a fed operation with those messages. Yesterday, I pretty casually mentioned to you guys something: that the doorbell cam footage, which TMZ happened upon somehow, was from a street upon which a ton of employees that work for Caldera Engineering live. We showed you—I think—one or two of those employees. The husband and wife I had mentioned worked for Caldera Engineering, and it is a ^t-00-14-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=925" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-15-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** valves and pipes. And I said this: I said, I know nothing about the valve industry. All I know is that every time I start investigating a government conspiracy or looking into people that are really shady like Harley Pasternak—thus far three people who I've investigated who oddly, either them or their families, had backgrounds working in this very niche valve and piping industry, like manufacturers of valves and pipes. Like, is everybody doing that? This is very strange. Well, many of you emailed me something that was quite surprising. ^t-00-15-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=970" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-16-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Maybe I'm just ignorant, but you let me know that this is a very niche industry. And by niche, I mean that you asserted that it implies major government contracts, likely the CIA. Those of you who have worked at those industries telling me that there are even certain valves that are exclusively manufactured in Israel, and that they tend to be involved in this. The government and the military tend to be involved in this. And that even, by the way, on Caldera's website, they noted that they have worked in Israel. They have a map that they note every country that they have done engineering projects in. And one of them, or two dots, are in Israel. ^t-00-16-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1011" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-16-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And somebody explained why the government gets involved when it comes to valves and piping. And I'm just going to read you this email because maybe there are people at home who are just as ignorant as I am about government-level engineering, okay? This person wrote, "Hi Candace, I wanted to share some detailed information regarding valves, piping and their relevance to critical infrastructure and intelligence communities. Valves as critical infrastructure assets. Modern industrial valves are used in pipelines, water treatment plants, power plants, and chemical facilities. They are often automated and networked, forming part of operational technology and SCADA systems. ^t-00-16-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1051" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-17-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** This allows remote monitoring and control of the flow of gas, oil, water, and chemicals. Cybersecurity implications. These valves are part of systems that could be targeted for cyber attacks. Compromised valves can cause pipeline ruptures, water contamination, or industrial accidents. Because of this, intelligence and regulatory agencies—the CISA, NSA, PHMSA, FERC—monitor valve networks and may maintain trusted relationships with manufacturers and engineers to ensure security and resilience. Integration with above-ground systems. Modern valve networks can also integrate with cameras, sensors, alarms, and environmental monitoring. ^t-00-17-31

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1095" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-18-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** This means that an operator could simultaneously monitor flow, view live video, and respond to alarms, which enhances both security and operational oversight. And strategic value for intelligence communities: knowledge of valve locations, models, and control systems provide insight into critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. Access to, or relationships with, manufacturers allows agencies to monitor, assess, and secure supply chains. Remote monitoring of valves and integrated systems can support emergency response simulations and national security exercises. And then they provide us with the real-world context by writing: companies like Caldera Engineering in Provo, Utah, manufacture specialized industrial valves and control systems. ^t-00-18-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1140" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-19-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** While no public evidence currently links them to intelligence contracts, their products could theoretically be part of OT systems monitored by government agencies due to the critical nature of the infrastructure that they serve. In short, valves themselves are simple mechanical devices, but when networked and embedded in critical infrastructure, they become strategically important for monitoring security and intelligence purposes." That just sounds right to me. That—I mean, I'm telling you—every story, I'm like, what is this person? It's like, are their families in valves? Like, I mean, I don't know anybody's family that did this. I don't know. Again, like, this is the kind of stuff that, like, we don't know, know, but we know. And that hit. And I feel like there is a bigger piece of this that involves Caldera. ^t-00-19-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1183" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-19-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And like I said, I perceive a government conspiracy. You'd be a fool not to see a government conspiracy here, especially with the way that I am being attacked for simply trying to investigate this. And the attacks are growing frantic. It's almost as if they all received an email from somebody who said, I don't care what you say—make it up out of thin air and do not stop attacking Candace. That is the loudest. It's like an alarm went off. And everyone—people that I thought I was friends with— are coming after me with obscene lies that are just so easily fact-checked, so easily. You can debunk them in four seconds on the internet, and they're delivering it as though it's honest. We're gonna talk about that. ^t-00-19-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1225" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:20:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-20-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I was even surprised. PBD (Patrick Bet-David)—I mean, I've always been friendly with him. I've always been kind to him. I have done nothing wrong to him. And he seems to be kind of—he's the one who platformed, without any pushback, Eric Bolling. And I have an idea about why all that may be. I'll tell you in just a second. First, I want to remind you guys about GNOLand because what if smart contract platforms were not controlled by the elites or big tech? What if they were built by and for real builders—you know, the people? That's the question that GNOLand asked, and that's why they built GNOLand.

That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For just $28, that is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion.

Also telling you guys about the Wellness Company because it is flu season, which means that it's also flu shot season. After everything that we've been through over the last five years, the number of people getting flu shots is at a record low. I'm so grateful for that. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective at best, and that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries.

Based on what I have seen—thus far the evidence, the quote-unquote "receipts"—that require a way deeper investigation into the apparatus, the financial apparatus at Turning Point, there was definitely some weird activity leading up to this moment happening at the organization. ^t-00-31-27

That was Benjamin Netanyahu. Okay, years ago, on record saying that he was working with the government of America, and any person that criticized Israel would find themselves on the wrong side of the law.

In between the finger pointing, there was grieving. On Friday, the White House flew the flags at half staff, which got some criticism. But on a human level, you can see how hard the president is taking this. My condolences on the loss of your friend, Charlie Kirk. May I ask, sir—personally—how are you holding up over the last day and a half, sir?" "I think very good. And by the way, right there, you see all the trucks? They've just started construction of the new ballroom for the White House, which is something they've been trying to get—as you know—for about 150 years. And it's going to be a beauty." "Yes. He's at the fourth stage of grief. ^t-00-39-12

I don't think that that would have been the justification for saying that he now needs to donate to charity and lose his whole life. And this is what happened. He's taken off air, and some people are saying, hey, Candace, they did this to us—and you're not wrong, right? If you are on the right and you are saying that when the whole George Floyd thing happened, people lost their jobs for saying sensible things or making a joke— you are correct. You are right to say, yes, that absolutely did happen. But if you're not recognizing that when you just flip the coin, it's the same people that are gaining more power— I just want ^t-00-40-16

I want the reaction—if you're angry about what Jimmy Kimmel said—is for the free markets to take him out, right? He doesn't have a show because nobody's watching him anymore because they're so disgusted by what he said. That's what I want. I want us to be in control, right, of where we spend our dollars, of what we're saying, and not, like, the government to press a button and say, you lose everything because we don't like what you said. And it should be noted, by the way, that in the same monologue, he did call the murder senseless. The day that it happened, Jimmy Kimmel posted a message on Instagram sending love to the Kirk family, to the victims of gun violence. ^t-00-40-58

On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents, and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence. You wouldn't have thought that he had posted that in terms of everyone that were just, like, stripping him of everything. And I want to be clear: I don't like Jimmy Kimmel, right? I think he is a part of the radical left. The people that are constantly shouting—I don't like him at all. But I'm just recognizing that our solution to being angry at each other always seems to be let's give the government more power, right? Let's give the government more power. And that's what happened here, okay? The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, jumped up, and he criticized Jimmy Kimmel's remarks. ^t-00-41-34

What? Federal action if you carry the Jimmy Kimmel show? Does that seem right to you? Okay, again, if you're on the right and you cheered this on, do you understand we never, ever, ever should be applauding federal action when it comes to speech? Okay, we're all losing. We are all losing. You have to wake up. That's what happened. Brendan Carr of the FCC was joining Benny Johnson. And that's what he said—that he absolutely wants to make sure that people are not carrying this show anymore. And that after—you know—one of the mergers that they did, I just see the same people are constantly being empowered. And I want to point that out to you because you have to be more conscious of that. ^t-00-42-18

And it's completely wrong. It's completely crazy. And they're also calling for him to make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA. What? That's a shakedown. That's what they did to Kyrie Irving. I don't like what you said. Donate to the Holocaust Museum. What? I can't cheer this on, guys. I'm sorry. I can't cheer this on because I don't like it. I know for a fact—and I just showed you—that this was Charlie's fear. The government coming in on speech. That's what's happening right now. They're taking over our speech under the guise of fighting hate. TikTok, by the way— did you guys see this? Israel's pretty much taking over TikTok. ^t-00-43-02

Marc Andreessen—in on a deal with, I think it's Silver Lake Capital. What is it? Not Silver. Silver Lake—they're all coming together, and we knew this was going to happen. This whole fake "cancel TikTok." No, TikTok was going pro-Palestine, and a bunch of hedge fund people who are pro-Israel got involved. Trump (Donald Trump) pretended that he was going to rescue speech. No, he's handing it over to Israel. Okay. Wake up. If you're a Trump supporter, wake up. ^t-00-43-41

He has handed so much over to Israel, and he's about to hand over the keys to our speech. All that aside—all that aside—I do want to shout out all the creators that are making me laugh. Let's use our speech while we're still allowed to have it. And you also have to remember Charlie wanted us to be happy warriors. So while we are fighting for truth, while we are fighting for transparency, we should remember that we should laugh, and we should be happy. And the clips that you guys are making regarding how the feds think that we speak after that ridiculous made-up text chain between Tyler Robinson and his lover Lance—they're hilarious. Your TikToks and the videos are hilarious. I'm gonna show you just one here. This is Chris Olsen, @ChrisOlsen. He's actually over on Instagram. Take a listen. ^t-00-44-23

What went wrong, FBI? What went wrong? Speak to us. Let us help you. You guys are just old. Like, what's going on? I actually think there was a person on TikTok—I hate to not credit them, but I genuinely don't remember what handle it was. I was just scrolling through—but he suggested that what went wrong was that they did use AI, and in their AI prompt, they said to create a conversation between 20-year-olds—or like a conversation between 20-year-olds—but they actually wrote, like, the AI understood it as, like, not people in their 20s, but, like, people in the '20s—like the 1920s. And I was like, that actually could have been what went wrong. They prompted AI, and they said between people in their 20s, and actually they wrote "people in the '20s," and they just went with it. And that's why you have this "Hello, my love." ^t-00-45-39

And I feel good about that. So yeah, that's what I'm doing this weekend in memorial of Charlie Kirk. I'm going to keep investigating every single lead until I solve his murder. What are you doing? What are you doing? Get some of your comments. Also, I want to respond to some of you guys that were emailing us about the Dairy Queen photo. You were like, this is an old photo. ^t-00-46-24

It was a poster—Superman. I'll explain to you why that poster—that picture—is definitely not taken in July. First, I want to tell you guys about PureTalk because our society works because of the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment: free speech, okay? Even if I hate your speech, I want you to have it. Everyday Americans should be able to speak openly, and they should be able to speak honestly about family, their traditional values without any retribution—obviously. And that's the principle that PureTalk proudly supports. They sponsor my show, which allows me to stand strong behind the microphone every day and share truth with you guys. If you want to support brands that defend freedom and pro-American values, I encourage you to switch your wireless service to PureTalk. You are going to get great 5G coverage, an extremely reliable and secure network. And with plans from just $25 a month, you'll save a ton of money. ^t-00-47-09

So if you're a small business owner, you can save even more while enjoying white glove service. Stand with companies who share your values. Go to puretalk.com/Owens to switch to my wireless company, PureTalk. Right now, you will save an additional 50% off your first month. Again, visit puretalk.com/Owens to make the switch today. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing because if you have been living on credit cards just to cover groceries, gas, and bills, you know those interest rates are absolutely brutal. Why keep paying 20% or more to the banks when you could just call my friends at American Financing? Because they have mortgage rates right now that are in the fives, and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pocket and out of the hands of credit card companies. Right now, American Financing is helping homeowners save an average of about $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high-interest debt. And there are no upfront fees, no obligations. ^t-00-47-50

There's also another kicker. If you start today, you could delay two mortgage payments, which puts even more cash in your hands right away. So don't wait. Call American Financing right now. The number's 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or you can visit americanfinancing.net/Owens. Again, that's americanfinancing.net/Owens. ^t-00-48-33

First, I want to tell you guys: Dairy Queen photo—some of you guys noticed that there was this old Superman poster, and that Superman in the background there—that poster—you said they removed those ads back in June or July. You are correct. That's when that movie came out, and that's when they were scheduled to remove those ads. But rest assured—first and foremost, for two reasons—that that is not—definitely it's not—footage from July. July—just so you guys understand—there is not a place in the world that would have the bandwidth to keep 24-hour footage inside of their restaurant dating back months. It auto-deletes. I think the footage at my house—because we have cameras absolutely everywhere— I think it's every 48 hours, every 72 hours. I think the highest you might see that is one week. This is absolutely... By the way, how would that person have known to go back to July? ^t-00-49-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=2997" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:49:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-49-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Could you imagine having to scroll the footage? I think I one time saw that person in July eating something here. Let's go back and scrub—like, that's just—that definitely did not happen. The source we had was very solid. It was very specific. And also saying that they threw away clothes in the nearby cemetery was very specific. This person was very confident when they shared it. But also something else that lets you date it—to pull back up that photo— is behind—right—their advertising "available now." What that actually is is a—and I gotta remember the name of it. It's—I don't know why I didn't write it down. It's a maple leaf blizzard thing. It's maple leaf something. That dropped, and they began using those advertisements for that drink on August 31st. ^t-00-49-57

And that's if they put up that advertisement immediately. Yes, the maple cookie shake. That's what it was. They began advertising on August 31st. So it's not from July. ^t-00-50-39

And we are taking a look at everything. You guys have sent me so much more, by the way, which I'm going to get into this weekend in memorial of Charlie Kirk—about the house next door, some weird stuff that was happening at that house, what has been advertised at that vacant house where the locals believe that's the real place that they should have went to. People are telling me a lot of stuff about CIA action at UVU, some programs that they had been running—that there's a pipeline from people at UVU to people that go and work for the CIA. So there's a lot to investigate, but I also want to be given the time to fact-check everything so that we don't go after the wrong people. Again, if you have any tips, any photos, you know where to send them. Candace, I mean, that's not right. Don't send it there. Tips@candaceowens.com. And yeah, for those of you guys who have supported this, thank you so much. Like I said yesterday and the day before, we see you in the comments fighting for us. And I will say it is a good thing they're attacking this hard. It's actually waking more people up. People are watching my show, watching them lie, debunking their lies and going, okay, why did they do that? Like, why would PBD do that? Like, we've always been friends—friendly. He was very kind to me. I've always been kind to him. Why just allow these people to lie? ^t-00-51-24

It's stunning to me. Even when he says Andrew Kolvet was there on the Hamptons—no, he wasn't. Andrew Kolvet was definitely not there in the Hamptons. What are you lying about? Very strange. Is there—like—are you being paid to lie? Or do you actually believe those lies? I don't know. But all I know is that I'm not gonna get distracted by them. We are going to solve the murder of my friend, Charlie Kirk. And if you guys would like to support us, we are independent. As I tell you, you can sign up at our website, CandaceOwens.com. Buy yourself this. This is pretty bomb. Yep, our CIA line. This is the Candace Intelligence Agency. Some people think that it actually says, like, CIA. The Decentralized Intelligence Agency. The Decentralized Intelligence Agency. ^t-00-52-10
