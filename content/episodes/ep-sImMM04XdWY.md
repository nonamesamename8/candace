I gotta tell you, in those weeks following <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-32"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination, I didn't feel like myself. I felt like I was honestly having an out-of-body experience. I didn't want to accept things. Obviously, you know, that's the reason that I went away to <span id="ent-gpe-wyoming-t-00-01-32"><a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a></span>. But with every... week that we move further from <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-01-32"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>, I have more clarity. And I'm starting to focus on things that happened in those early days. And there are certain things that are playing in my mind over and over again. I would say that happened in the first 72 hours following <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination. ^t-00-01-32

It seems like if you have to lie ever, it's because you're covering up the truth. Duh. And like I said, my initial sense was that all of us would come together and try to figure out who did this because the <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-02-07"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> story wasn't making any sense. Well, I want to tell you guys this. There's another phone call that<span id="event-event-2025-09-17-sheriff-holds-press-conference-on-tyler-robinson-c-t-00-02-07"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-17-sheriff-holds-press-conference-on-tyler-robinson-c.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> I had with <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-02-07"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span> where I was crying on the phone with him. ^t-00-02-07

He said, and I quote, "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-02-44"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, it was supposed to be you." It was supposed to be you. Now at the time, I dismissed this as some sort of bargaining, right? That's an actual stage of grief. You do bargain. You wish that it was this person. You could trade it. Maybe you wish that it was yourself. And to be honest, I did go through that phase of bargaining with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. Like, why didn't it happen to somebody else? This is a good person who had his whole life ahead of him. I mean, I told you that even my father went through that stage of grief. ^t-00-02-44

But now I'm feeling a little bit different, removed from the situation. Like now I'm going, "Was I being...? I don't know. Was he being honest? Was <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-03-29"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew</a></span> being honest?" <a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew</a> trying to maybe communicate to me after, especially given the fact that I told you that while the actual day on <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-03-29"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span> while <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was in the hospital, he told me that there was a list and that me and <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-03-29"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a> were on it and that we had to lay low, but he never told me who told him that.

Another person was a very well-known woman who happens to be married to a <span id="ent-org-central-intelligence-agency-t-00-04-12"><a href="/entities/org-central-intelligence-agency.md">CIA</a></span> contractor. Same exact message. "You and <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a>." But, of course, we cannot tell you who we are getting this information from. I'm starting to realize as I consider who the sources are and their closeness to the military. And now that we've gotten into the story and realize that virtually everybody there that day has these military ties, that that threat may have been coming from the government actually. ^t-00-04-12

So they were not concerned about any other rooftops. They were not concerned about walking to make sure that they had access to other rooftops—obviously—or to make sure that they could see what points it was that the people could just walk onto the courtyard.

After <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-40-42"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s alleged shooter was taken into custody in <a href="/entities/gpe-washington-county.md">Washington County</a> less than two days after the shooting— "Within the hour, my friend drove <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a> and his parents to my office where he was greeted by plainclothes detectives." After learning of this, I submitted a public records request to obtain any video of <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-40-42"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> walking into the jail facility. <a href="/entities/gpe-washington-county.md">Washington County</a> responded saying there were no records responsive to the request as <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> did not go to the jail area. A request for any holding room video was denied. A few weeks later, I re-upped the request on a more generalized scale for surveillance video showing <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> walking into the sheriff's office. ^t-00-40-42

The response: "Our office does not have any applicable records responsive to this request, as the surveillance footage is no longer available after the 30-day retention period." If, in fact, it has been destroyed and not preserved, it's very concerning. And if it has, then it's very concerning that they're telling you they don't have it. If they no longer have it, I would have expected to say that this video has been provided to the <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a> County law enforcement. "Please contact them."

And then he swallowed it actually because it actually ricocheted down into his stomach. He then makes a hasty retreat into a Dairy Queen where he texts every minute of what he did to his lover. And then despite going home to his lover— he decides the next day to still text his lover more about his dad. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, he's home, but they're still texting more because—like—that's what you should do as opposed to just talking to him face-to-face. And he wanted to get away with it.

Now, in all the time that I've been endorsing my wireless company, PureTalk, I have never seen an offer like this. Never. Right now, you can get unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited data with a 30-gig hotspot for just $29.95 a month for life. This is PureTalk's top-tier plan, which is normally $65 a month, and right now through December 7th, you can get all of that for just $29.95 a month. You're saving over 50% a month every month for life, and it's all on their crazy-fast 5G network. This offer is extremely short-lived, of course, so do not wait. Go to puretalk.com/owens for PureTalk's best unlimited plan for just $29.95 a month for life. Make the switch in as little as 10 minutes. You can keep your phone, keep your number, and you can start saving with their unlimited-for-life plan. Again, that's puretalk.com/owens to switch to my wireless company, which is PureTalk. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing because <span id="ent-org-federal-reserve-t-00-45-05"><a href="/entities/org-federal-reserve.md">the Fed</a></span> just dropped interest rates again, and that is good news for American homeowners.

But with rates dropping, now is a perfect time to start paying off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They are saving people just like you an average of $800 a month. And many are seeing rates in the low fives. That's a complete game-changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. ^t-00-45-45

If I had a niece like you, I'd be crazy proud." Thank you so much for saying that. And no, I've never been recruited by the government. And I feel really dumb for thinking that things could be resolved in government. Like I said, if there is any silver lining in the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-50-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> assassination, it's that I think it taught all of us a lesson about our faith that we could somehow fix it in this system.

The <a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Epstein</a> files, the sort of collapse of <span id="ent-gpe-hollywood-t-00-50-01"><a href="/entities/gpe-hollywood.md">Hollywood</a></span>, the stories that we are learning and watching the elites protect <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-50-01"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span>—his victims speaking out and saying presidents—Republican and Democrat—and all of them worked to cover this—lets us know that we gotta stop pointing fingers at one another.

We don't know what happens behind closed doors, and he could be fearful of that. I would hope that we elect leaders that are braver than that, but he could definitively obviously be fearful. Kash? That's just corruption. I mean, once I saw the article—he was blocking Tulsi's office— I lost all faith in Kash. ^t-00-50-42

He described the damage that was done and just said, "In case you want to share with your viewers— in case they actually think that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s neck somehow stopped this."
