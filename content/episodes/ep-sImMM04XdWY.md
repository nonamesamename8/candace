**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=1" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-00-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. I know that I say that every episode is going to be explosive, but the lies and the intentional misrepresentations that are being delivered by Turning Point USA and their affiliates are really reaching a fever pitch because we can confirm that Brian Harpole lied badly to Sean Ryan in an interview that one of the heads of security gave the other day. And I'm going to explain to you how we know that. I'm starting to think that we should believe that nothing they've told us is real. Plus, I don't think we can reasonably ignore that odd French company in Delaware. ^t-00-00-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=39" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-00-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now that our source proved to us that it certainly wasn't established to provide any maintenance to those Egyptian planes, and it was more than likely a front for something else, we should address that. Because I know that many of you guys were wondering whether or not Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination was meant to distract us from the Brigitte Macron investigation. And rightfully so; that is a fair question. Because as you guys know, it was Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk that called me and told me that they wanted me to stop speaking about Brigitte. But the question is always, who is "they"? Who is "they"? Welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=92" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-01-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Grief is weird, okay? I gotta tell you, in those weeks following Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, I didn't feel like myself. I felt like I was honestly having an out-of-body experience. I didn't want to accept things. Obviously, you know, that's the reason that I went away to Wyoming. But with every... week that we move further from September 10th, I have more clarity. And I'm starting to focus on things that happened in those early days. And there are certain things that are playing in my mind over and over again. I would say that happened in the first 72 hours following Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. ^t-00-01-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=127" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-02-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I was in a state of trauma, and not for a single second during that state of trauma did I believe that Turning Point USA would later be involved in what seems like a coverup, right? It seems like if you have to lie ever, it's because you're covering up the truth. Duh. And like I said, my initial sense was that all of us would come together and try to figure out who did this because the Tyler Robinson story wasn't making any sense. Well, I want to tell you guys this. There's another phone call that I had with Andrew Colvett where I was crying on the phone with him. ^t-00-02-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=164" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-02-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I mean, I am talking maybe 72 hours max after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was killed, and he was also upset on the phone, but he said something, and it's hitting differently the more that I think about it. He said, and I quote, "Candace, it was supposed to be you." It was supposed to be you. Now at the time, I dismissed this as some sort of bargaining, right? That's an actual stage of grief. You do bargain. You wish that it was this person. You could trade it. Maybe you wish that it was yourself. And to be honest, I did go through that phase of bargaining with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Like, why didn't it happen to somebody else? This is a good person who had his whole life ahead of him. I mean, I told you that even my father went through that stage of grief. ^t-00-02-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=209" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-03-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** My father was like, "This makes me feel terrible because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) has lived his life so admirably, and like I've had so many chances in life, so many illnesses, and it just makes me so sad." But now I'm feeling a little bit different, removed from the situation. Like now I'm going, "Was I being...? I don't know. Was he being honest? Was Andrew being honest?" Andrew trying to maybe communicate to me after, especially given the fact that I told you that while the actual day on September 10th while Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was in the hospital, he told me that there was a list and that me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson were on it and that we had to lay low, but he never told me who told him that. I never got a call from the feds telling me that. ^t-00-03-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=252" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-04-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So I feel like these questions I have now are quite valid. Andrew, by the way, was not the only person who called me on that day and reached out to my family on that day with this warning, immediately cautioning me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to keep our mouths shut, telling us that we should lay low because there was a quote-unquote "list" going around. Another person was a very well-known woman who happens to be married to a CIA contractor. Same exact message. "You and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson." But, of course, we cannot tell you who we are getting this information from. I'm starting to realize as I consider who the sources are and their closeness to the military. And now that we've gotten into the story and realize that virtually everybody there that day has these military ties, that that threat may have been coming from the government actually. ^t-00-04-12

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=294" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-04-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That the globalized government that we live under, right? LOL to the idea that we have national sovereignty. They may have wanted me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to watch our friend die. And then that global gang wanted us to know that you will be next if you don't shut up. Like, really, "It was supposed to be you." And this new Satis angle is not something that seems subtle to me. When I consider that it was Charlie (Charlie Kirk) that called me, it was Charlie (Charlie Kirk) that said that they want me to stop speaking about Brigitte. And now I consider Satis, which according to our source—our well-placed source—is a front, right? ^t-00-04-54

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=336" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-05-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Suddenly this French company comes in and purchases, leases a hangar for only two years. OK, and during—immediately—this becomes a location where our Egyptian military plane is going to land in Wilmington, Delaware, not to get service. We know there was no maintenance happening because there was this lack of a lease since 2021. All of this now feels really interesting. Very interesting. And don't forget that that same core, that same source claimed that after our Egyptian plane, tail number SUBTT, landed into this federally monitored hangar, a foreign dignitary was then discreetly moved to 920 King Street, which we've learned and confirmed houses the DEA, ^t-00-05-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=376" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-06-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** the FBI, and the Secret Service. Quite rare, right? Quite rare for the Department of Justice to be coming together with the DEA. I mean, that's weird. So what does France have to do with it, right? What does Tucker (Tucker Carlson) have to do with it? Rationally, when I begin to create a timeline of when my life took a very different turn, it is because I began prodding the narrative on Israel at the exact same time that I began looking into the Brigitte Macron story. ^t-00-06-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=419" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-06-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That was in March of 2024. It was on March 13th, 2024, that I did the very first ever episode on Brigitte Macron, right? And then wham, I am fired within 10 days. It's a pretty quick turnaround. Charlie (Charlie Kirk), of course, was a staunch defender of mine immediately when I got fired, publicly and privately. He had my back, and then suddenly donors start to squeeze him and tell him that I can no longer hit the stage at Turning Point's Amfest. They want me gone from the Turning Point roster. I bring my new independent show back in June, and the timeline—actually, when I start to put these things together—is interesting. ^t-00-06-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=458" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-07-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So we're gonna bring that up here because I like timelines. It makes things neat, right? So we are in 2024, right? March 13th, I do that first episode regarding Brigitte Macron. March 19th, just six days later, I'm fired from the Daily Wire. I thought it was 10; it's actually six days later I get fired from the Daily Wire. Then, in mid-November, I began communicating with Xavier Poussard regarding the potential to interview him during an upcoming trip to London. Xavier Poussard is the person who wrote the "Becoming Brigitte" book. He has never been sued for defamation, and I was only going to interview him one time because he had never been on camera. ^t-00-07-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=498" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-08-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I thought that would be a great get, and I still believe that Brigitte Macron was born a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux. Suddenly, on December 3rd, before I interview him, I receive the first ever cease-and-desist letter from Brigitte Macron and her lawyers. And the funny thing is I didn't receive it. They sent it to a really strange inbox that was not monitored, right? This is only—and this is on December 3rd—you can see, please see attached the time-sensitive legal correspondence sent on behalf of our clients, President Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron. We urge you to provide this correspondence to legal counsel promptly. They sent it to the Club Candace info. ^t-00-08-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=543" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-09-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I was totally—a random box sent it to—so we didn't get it. We go back to our timeline. That's December 3rd. And seven days later is when it's announced that Satis—that's when it's publicly announced that Satis, that French company, has inked a deal in Wilmington, Delaware, for a hangar. Okay, there's suddenly a French company, and the CEO who knows Emmanuel Macron—we've confirmed that—decides they're gonna sign a two-year lease for an airport hangar to do what? To paint planes. I'm not kidding. Elsewhere in that article, it tells us that it's a French multinational company that specializes in the painting of aircraft, and they plan to open for business in a hangar not far from Wilmington Airport come the new year. ^t-00-09-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=580" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-09-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So in 2025, this is going to be their hangar. Okay, interesting. Back to our timeline. That is publicly announced on December 10th. And then on December 18th, Tom Clare sends another follow-up email regarding the cease-and-desist. And again, I don't receive it because he's sending it to this random box. I am forever thinking in my brain now, what if I had received it? I would have been spooked. I would have thought that they were monitoring communications between me and Xavier Poussard—the obvious answer—because I hadn't been speaking about Brigitte Macron on my podcast. ^t-00-09-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=619" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-10-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So what was up with the cease-and-desist? I think my suspicion is they knew that I was moving to interview Xavier Poussard, which I then did. As you can see on the timeline, on December 21st, I interview Xavier Poussard in London. We did not release it, right? We fast forward; we receive after he forwards it to our actual attorney and we receive the communication. And it actually just makes me angry because I'm pregnant. Now we're in 2025, and I decide that actually I'm going to turn this into an entire season because who are you, French first man, to tell us that we can't speak about the story, which is incredibly interesting? ^t-00-10-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=657" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-10-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And on January 31st, I release the first episode of "Becoming Brigitte." Brigitte season one airs, and obviously this show goes viral because it was a shocking story, an unbelievable story. People worldwide are going, "What the heck is going on? It's not what the press told us." It really kind of—it shocks your core that the press could be in on telling a lie this big. And then on February 17th, we premiere my sit-down with Xavier Poussard. Okay. ^t-00-10-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=703" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-11-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Jumping back into this timeline. That's on the 17th; that—that email comes; that we premiere that sit-down interview with Xavier Poussard. A couple of days later, on February 24th, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) reaches out, and he tells me that the White House is asking me to stop speaking about Brigitte. And he tells me that it is related to the peace deal in Ukraine. That is ostensibly the reason. On the same day, February 24th—that's how quickly the phone call happened. This is the day that Donald Trump meets with Emmanuel Macron. Do we have that, by the way, the text message between me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Here we go. Yeah, this is February 24th. I'm showing you guys this now. "Hey, I have something to tell you from the White House. They asked me to call you. I'm just the messenger here, but it's important." I say, "Okay, I'm around. Call me." Then we have the phone call. ^t-00-11-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=746" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-12-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And then I was upset about the phone call because I was pregnant, and then I felt bad, and I was like, "Okay, let me think about it," because I don't want people in Russia to be killed because I won't stop speaking about Brigitte if the Ukraine peace deal is actually at the center of this. And he says, "Okay." And then I tried to say, "I will circle back tomorrow," or maybe I said "tonight." "Call if you want to chat at all." And we did; we chatted. The next day, you can see he starts with, "The White House just asked for your number, FYI. I think POTUS might call you." And that's not what happened. On February 25th, actually, Sergio Gor called me and asked me to stop speaking about Brigitte. And it felt more like an order than a request. And I did not respond in kind to that. February 26th. President Donald Trump calls me and asks me to stop speaking about Brigitte. Now, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s in the middle of this. ^t-00-12-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=791" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-13-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Communications are happening between me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) about Brigitte, okay? On July 1st—and by the way, the series is over, and I said I'll agree to be quiet about this for a while because it's no longer relevant, and I don't want Christian men to be slaughtered in Ukraine because I'm not keeping my mouth shut. Now, on July 1st, Macron sends another legal threat. On July 18th, this is where things get really interesting. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk hosts Tucker (Tucker Carlson) at Satis. This brings in the Tucker (Tucker Carlson) element, right? Tucker (Tucker Carlson), he tells Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to go max: call out Israel, Jeffrey Epstein, just go max. And guess what? Tucker (Tucker Carlson) really did go max. ^t-00-13-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=834" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-13-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I want to actually play for you this clip of what Tucker (Tucker Carlson) said on stage. Take a listen. (Clip of Tucker Carlson) ^t-00-13-54

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=841" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-14-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** The unfairness of it drives you crazy. And it's particularly galling in the case of Jeffrey Epstein and the whole constellation of people around Jeffrey Epstein, all of whom seem to be getting away with scams. And how do you know they're getting away with scams? I'll tell you how: because they're useless and they're rich. So how do you come to a place where some of the least impressive, most useless people who have no actual skills become billionaires? How's that legitimate? And by the way, if you ask this question—at least in Washington—it's like, "Oh, well, yeah, sounds like you're a socialist." Sounds like socialism. Yeah, okay, I'm a socialist now. All right. I was a Qatari agent or a bigot; now I'm a socialist. All right. Leaving aside my committed socialism, can you answer the question? ^t-00-14-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=883" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-14-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** How did Bill Ackman get $9 billion? Bill Ackman—a pretty impressive guy? I know Bill Ackman. No. Bill Ackman's like well-connected and super-aggressive. That's it. And I think, you know, well-connected, super-aggressive people deserve a fair living like everybody else, but if you're accruing $9 billion just because you're willing to do anything? I don't know why we have to pretend that's good. How did Epstein get four Gulfstreams? How did he get an island, a massive ranch in New Mexico, the biggest house in New York? Like, what is that? Like, at some point, the basic economics really matter, and they matter because not that it's bad that rich people are getting richer—it's bad that everyone else is getting poorer. And it's especially bad the young people can't afford homes. ^t-00-14-43

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=924" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-15-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is getting to the heart: there is that we don't live in a meritocracy, right? You have people who, because of their bloodlines, are just being handed things, right? Bari Weiss is a perfect example of that. Nobody knows why she is an executive at CBS. She has no objective talent. I will guarantee you everyone around her is smarter than her. And yet CBS picked Bari Weiss. There's a reason for that. There is a reason why people who are talented can be completely shut out, taken out, told that they can't even be in the system—thinking about Kanye West, right? Because of what he's saying. ^t-00-15-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=968" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:08</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-16-08.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And then people who have no talent are suddenly everywhere. Billboards. We're being told this is the most beautiful person, the smartest person; this person has what it takes to have a makeup brand—whatever it is—and they have no objective talent. That is not something that they would want messaged to Generation Z, Generation Coming Up, who's recognizing that something's not fair, that perhaps this whole idea that we live in a meritocracy is one big illusion. Anyways, back to our timeline, right? Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson says that, and we then have on July 18th that the request from Turning Point's UVU chapter—which we've not been able to independently verify, but that's what the local news said; that they saw it with their own eyes, but we didn't see it. That's when the request comes in for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to speak at UVU, very late in the day—never happens this way, okay? Like I told you, they are always working at least a semester behind on requests, but this one's happening quickly. ^t-00-16-08

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=1013" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-16-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** This is really interesting because BTT then comes in from Cairo through Paris and lands in Omaha, Nebraska, and it's the longest stay actually that they have in Wilmington, okay? They do this long stay, and that's not in Nebraska. That long stay that I'm referring to is happening in Wilmington. They stay in Wilmington for six days, okay? That happens to be—from the 20th to the 26th—that happens to be the period that Brigitte and Emmanuel Macron released to the Financial Times that they are suing me in a Delaware court, right? ^t-00-16-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=1049" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-17-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Not saying that Brigitte or Emmanuel are on this plane. What I'm saying is that could it have been a dignitary that was on this plane—a French dignitary that was on this plane? All options are possible at this point because guess who owns the hangar? A French company, okay? A French company owns the hangar. So that's interesting. Go back into this timeline, and something else happens that's very strange in this constellation right after that. ^t-00-17-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=1093" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-18-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** By the way, I'm gonna show you this. So odd—like we were so surprised when we got this. Yeah, they depart on the 26th from Wilmington heading back to Cairo. They released it in that period of time that they're suing me. On July 27th, I'm showing you this private communication between my legal team. We were very confused about why this lawsuit was being filed in Delaware. Not putting anything together. Obviously, I didn't know about Satis. Nothing. This is my lawyer, and he says, "Here's the PDF. It's massive." We're likely going to try to file a motion to dismiss to stay the case on the grounds that it's inconvenient to litigate in Delaware because you're in Tennessee. Your companies in Delaware do not defame anyone. The witnesses are in Tennessee. The Macrons are not citizens of Delaware. Thus, there's no connection to Delaware. ^t-00-18-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=1138" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-18-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Like, what are we doing in Delaware? We should dismiss in Delaware and say that they have to file where you are—like where they claim that they have been defamed is here in Tennessee. That's so interesting to me in retrospect that we didn't understand why this was happening in Delaware. Anyways, moving on to August 1st—same week—Tucker (Tucker Carlson) releases an episode with me. And what goes viral from that episode is that we are discussing the Brigitte case. Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is interested; he's watched the series; he believes that Brigitte Macron was born a man—or born a male, rather—and that goes viral, okay? It just goes viral; gets more people speaking about it. So you can see a lot of stuff is happening at this time. Then what we have is in very early August; we know that that is when Turning Point is beginning to scout this location for their events. The school is telling them, "This is not a great place for you to host this because there's no traffic control here." ^t-00-18-58

It again goes through to Wilmington, and it stays one night on August 23rd in Wilmington before heading back to Cairo.

Very interesting as to whether or not on that Egyptian—quote-unquote "Egyptian"—plane, there could have been foreigners that are not from Egypt. And I think that's pretty obvious that these people were not from Egypt, okay?

I am very curious about how that timeline is coming together because we were getting very close to something as we had started on September 8th, by the way, our "Becoming Brigitte" season two. And we were looking at how unusual it was that a dog was barking a bit too loud—you know, a thief that nobody was pursuing was running. And that was us discussing the MKUltra program and Brigitte Macron strangely and Emmanuel mentioning MKUltra in the lawsuit to us 18 times struck us as odd as we were trying to determine whether or not it could have been Brigitte Macron that was involved in that Stanford experiment—this prisoner 2093 that was being protected.

And it was something that was so sinister, you know, involving maybe another step of the MKUltra program being used to foster serial killers and to give serial killers new identities and allowing them to run in countries. That was kind of conversations that I was having in the background with Xavier. And we thought that we had perhaps identified Brigitte Macron at Stanford University—a possibility is what I would say; we were maybe at 50-50%—and then suddenly Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk gets assassinated, and it totally throws us off of the scent entirely because we're trying to figure out what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-23-08

Is it plausible that for whatever reason, Charlie (Charlie Kirk), allowing Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to hit the stage and to say that, made Charlie (Charlie Kirk) a bigger problem than us? I have to tell you guys, in my gut of guts, there is something unbelievably—I just look at Brigitte Macron, and I am telling you, you are looking at an utter psychopath in my view.

They are taking this way too far. The reality is that these countries that have so much power and these leaders that have been in place and these systems that have been in place— yeah, and part of it is because of how much money they have and the lengths they will go through to keep things a secret. But the thing that they are forgetting is perception is nine-tenths of the law, right?

I mean, you decided to lease this hangar for two years—a very short time—to paint some planes. Could you tell us who landed in Wilmington, Delaware, and we're shuttled over to 920 King?

And he should be upset that he got played because they're basically using him to, uh, just propagandize the situation and pretend that they're somehow the victims. Something else that is very strange that I was told early on when all of these leaks were coming is that not only did Turning Point not walk the campus when they got there—I'm referring to the security—but also the only thing that Dan Flood apparently cared about was making sure that their SUVs had clear access behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—in and out access. So they were not concerned about any other rooftops. They were not concerned about walking to make sure that they had access to other rooftops—obviously—or to make sure that they could see what points it was that the people could just walk onto the courtyard. They weren't concerned about any of that. All they cared about, for whatever reason, was the Hall of Flags—controlled access in the Hall of Flags. And I'm wondering if that reason is because— this is really interesting.

So, the story goes—and I told you that the story was BS—but what the feds told us was that, you know, grandpa's gun was missing, and then a friend called, and, you know, the dad—the dad—Tyler Robinson's dad recognized his own son, and then turned his son in. And I told you that was a lie. That's not how things went down. And I was called a liar, and no one believed that I had sources. ^t-00-39-41

Remember that storyline? Well, it doesn't seem like we're ever going to be able to get that footage because it's now missing, question mark. Take a listen to KUER TV News Investigating.

**🎤 SPEAKER_4**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=2442" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:40:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-40-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** On September 17th, 2025, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby held a press conference. "Our job was not to interview; our job was just to get him here." After Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s alleged shooter was taken into custody in Washington County less than two days after the shooting— "Within the hour, my friend drove Tyler and his parents to my office where he was greeted by plainclothes detectives." After learning of this, I submitted a public records request to obtain any video of Tyler Robinson walking into the jail facility. Washington County responded saying there were no records responsive to the request as Robinson did not go to the jail area. A request for any holding room video was denied. A few weeks later, I re-upped the request on a more generalized scale for surveillance video showing Tyler Robinson walking into the sheriff's office. ^t-00-40-42

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=2480" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:41:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-41-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** "For the state of Utah, we would certainly hope that this video is available." The response: "Our office does not have any applicable records responsive to this request, as the surveillance footage is no longer available after the 30-day retention period." If, in fact, it has been destroyed and not preserved, it's very concerning. And if it has, then it's very concerning that they're telling you they don't have it. If they no longer have it, I would have expected to say that this video has been provided to the Utah County law enforcement. "Please contact them." But instead, this rhetoric leads—in my opinion—as trying to shut the door and not give you free access to the press. ^t-00-41-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=2524" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:42:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-42-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** While it's not clear if the video exists and was just handed over to another agency, in a response to me, Washington County shared with me they don't believe the video was shared with anyone involved in the case. Wanting to get videos showing that he turned himself in and the manner he did so would be crucial for the defense work of mitigation. ^t-00-42-04

We just can't get one verifiable piece of evidence that Tyler Robinson even exists. Does he even exist? I think it's a fair question. Is he just an AI app? Does Tyler Robinson even exist at this point? Feels like a fair question. ^t-00-42-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=2574" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:42:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-42-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Because we just can't—we can't get one clear image. And now—which good on them for realizing, "Oh, wait, actually, we can put in a GRAMA request and figure out whether—like—we can just watch him turn himself in." That's a big part of the story. Heroic dad marches his son in and says, "Here he is." I told you that was all crap. So what actually happened? What actually happened? He also can't appear in person. He's appearing electronically. He doesn't have to put his video on for court hearings. ^t-00-42-54

How dare they call anything that we are covering a conspiracy theory? The conspiracy theory—I'll tell you what it is right now. I don't want you guys to be conspiracy theorists. The conspiracy theory is that Tyler Robinson, who did not attend UVU, had never been on UVU campus, packed up his car that day, jumped onto a rooftop, figured out how to like jump around like Spider-Man and just knew exactly where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would be seated—despite having never been there—took a shot—one shot with .30-06 that got stopped because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) eats spinach. And then he swallowed it actually because it actually ricocheted down into his stomach. He then makes a hasty retreat into a Dairy Queen where he texts every minute of what he did to his lover. And then despite going home to his lover— he decides the next day to still text his lover more about his dad. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, he's home, but they're still texting more because—like—that's what you should do as opposed to just talking to him face-to-face. And he wanted to get away with it. And he expresses that. ^t-00-43-38

That's actually the conspiracy theory. Like, that's the tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. I don't want you guys to believe that. That's crazy. That is totally crazy stuff. ^t-00-44-21

Now, in all the time that I've been endorsing my wireless company, PureTalk, I have never seen an offer like this. Never. Right now, you can get unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited data with a 30-gig hotspot for just $29.95 a month for life. This is PureTalk's top-tier plan, which is normally $65 a month, and right now through December 7th, you can get all of that for just $29.95 a month. You're saving over 50% a month every month for life, and it's all on their crazy-fast 5G network. This offer is extremely short-lived, of course, so do not wait. Go to puretalk.com/owens for PureTalk's best unlimited plan for just $29.95 a month for life. Make the switch in as little as 10 minutes. You can keep your phone, keep your number, and you can start saving with their unlimited-for-life plan. Again, that's puretalk.com/owens to switch to my wireless company, which is PureTalk. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing because the Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that is good news for American homeowners. If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than right now to get your finances in order. ^t-00-45-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=2745" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:45:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-45-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is so expensive and credit cards are already being pushed to the max. But with rates dropping, now is a perfect time to start paying off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They are saving people just like you an average of $800 a month. And many are seeing rates in the low fives. That's a complete game-changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. ^t-00-45-45

The holidays are going to be here before you know it. So do not wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today. You can call American Financing at 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210 or visit americanfinancing.net/owens—americanfinancing.net/owens. All right, you guys. If you would like to support us and support our independent endeavor, you can obviously go to our website and buy new merch. We have a Black Friday sale running right now, so this is a good time to do it. If you use code BLACK20, you will get 20% off store-wide. That does not include books. ^t-00-46-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=2830" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:47:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-47-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** If you'd like to buy my new book "Make Him a Sandwich," you can head to MakeHimASandwich.com for our regularly priced books. And then we have signed copies that are also available on the CandaceOwens.com website. By the way, tomorrow book club will be at 6 p.m. Eastern because today is my son's birthday. And I did not calculate that when I said to bump it to Thursday. So it will be tomorrow, and we will continue reading "Sigmund Freud and the Jewish Mystical Tradition." Okay, top comment from yesterday. Angela wrote: "To all those working in government that still have morals and are willing to leak information involving corruption—God bless you. Thank you for helping us get justice and not tormenting us." Carl writes: "Candace, thanks for what you are doing to expose all this evil. What can we do besides watching your show, buying your book, etc.? Christ is king. Thanks." Well, take that to mean what it is, which is that truth will win; truth will prevail; truth is king. And I am telling you guys that it's not enough to just know the truth; you have to speak it. Speaking the truth—I just know that that is significant. ^t-00-47-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=2874" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:47:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-47-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It is more powerful. It's almost like the frequency of a truth hits more powerfully than a lie. And they have rendered so many people silent out of fear. That's why they do this stuff. Speak the truth; share the truth. That's the little part that you can do every single day. Redenta Mama writes: "My fingers are tired from pushing back on quote-unquote Christians on X calling you sinister. I said he's paid or he's not listening. He used me to claim that you train cult lines. That's interesting. They're not watching you, or they are sinister. A proud member of the not-so-secret Candace cult." Yeah. If I'm culting, I'm doing it wrong. I'm telling you to trust your gut and your intuition about things, and you should. And you're seeing that it is—like I said—very strange that so many Christians are now trying to tell us that it's not biblical to pursue truth, right? ^t-00-47-54

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=2914" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:48:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-48-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Of course, you have to ask questions to pursue truth. To get to the truth, you cannot just accept blanket narratives from people who are not authorities—like, I mean, like—who are just deeming themselves authorities and saying, "Well, listen to me." I guess we should just listen to Kash Patel because he's Kash Patel. That's ridiculous, obviously. If you choose to trust, you should also verify. And they are now trying to tell you that that process of verification is satanic, which couldn't be further from the truth. M. Poulice writes: "A gang of demented—" he's quoting me here— "A gang of demented psychopaths rule over us, and their solution to being caught doing psychopathic things is to murder us." I had to rewind that last episode. "Candace, your investigation is uncovering so much that would never see the light of day. Stay safe." Yeah. I think there was something about the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination that made a lot of us want to be brave because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was about as safe socks as it gets. You know, he really was. And they assassinated him anyways. So how can we feel safe? ^t-00-48-34

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sImMM04XdWY&t=2960" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:49:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-sImMM04XdWY/t-00-49-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** How can everybody at home feel safe if Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who always tried to make it work, was always everybody's friend, was somehow assassinated in broad daylight and his friends are lying about it? I don't know; that doesn't feel good. I don't feel safe at all. Certainly being quiet isn't gonna make anybody safe, which is why we have been sharing everything as a form of insurance. It's just the information that we have; we share across with so many other people, and we've empowered other people to know what's going on behind the scenes too. VBVC writes: "Just know that Ron Paul has used his platform to speak about it. His friend Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk—questioning the official narrative—and if dark forces are responsible, a 9/10/2025, no one is as loud as you, but Ron is a real one too." I think you mean 9/10. He don't know—no—but he has always known. Yeah, he's another person that I should probably get some stuff out to—send him another insurance package as I'm now terming it. So they know everything that's going on behind the scenes and threats that are being received because that's what it's going to take. We have to decentralize intelligence. ^t-00-49-20

We support you." Thank you guys. Ms. Mint Julips writes: "You plus your unseen squad equals fire, and you are appreciated. The FBI has no integrity. That's why they never tried to recruit you. If I had a niece like you, I'd be crazy proud." Thank you so much for saying that. And no, I've never been recruited by the government. And I feel really dumb for thinking that things could be resolved in government. Like I said, if there is any silver lining in the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination, it's that I think it taught all of us a lesson about our faith that we could somehow fix it in this system. All of it's happening at once. The Epstein files, the sort of collapse of Hollywood, the stories that we are learning and watching the elites protect Jeffrey Epstein—his victims speaking out and saying presidents—Republican and Democrat—and all of them worked to cover this—lets us know that we gotta stop pointing fingers at one another. Elizabeth Jones writes: "Do you think Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination could be a message to Trump or Kash to stay in line?" ^t-00-50-01

We don't know what happens behind closed doors, and he could be fearful of that. I would hope that we elect leaders that are braver than that, but he could definitively obviously be fearful. Kash? That's just corruption. I mean, once I saw the article—he was blocking Tulsi's office— I lost all faith in Kash. ^t-00-50-42

Black Fatigue writes: "Candace, and for those who are curious, go on Google and type in .30-06 damage, then click on the images, and now ask yourself if you think that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot with .30-06. Viewer discretion advised." Yeah, somebody who recently got shot accidentally by a .30-06 on a hunting trip sent me a photo to our tips box, and it was shocking. I mean, absolutely shocking. He described the damage that was done and just said, "In case you want to share with your viewers— in case they actually think that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s neck somehow stopped this." And I am declining to share that, but I think we can confirm that there was no miracle-bending bullet from the Lozier Center. A smaller weapon was used. Crazy Chris writes: "Love the comfort shirt. Feels like I'm chilling with my sister. Love you." Thank you so much. I did decide to go a little chill today. Renee writes: "I wonder if our president's plane ever landed there in Delaware, where we know that Biden was living in Delaware." He lives in Delaware. He's from Delaware.
