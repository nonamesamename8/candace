**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Happy Monday, everybody. Today we are going to discuss, or rather I'm going to introduce to you, a psychological strategy that I refer to as "David hogging." Some of you guys remember David Hogg of the Parkland shooting tragedy. Of course you do. Well, it seems like Turning Point USA is now engaging in this strategy of David hogging the public. And I want it to be clear that it is downright manipulative, and I've really had enough of it. Frankly, what happened over the weekend is that their TP Action COO, Tyler Boyer, went on a little bit of an X binge. I don't recommend it, which was then highlighted by Alex Clark, who has a show over there on Instagram. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=42" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-00-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I think it's therefore fair for us to turn our attention back to them. So welcome back to Candace (Candace Owens). So let me put it to you this way. I'll give you a different scenario. If at this very moment, McDonald's publicly announced that their CEO was stepping down and they were going to replace him with somebody else, nobody would care, right? Like, there's not going to be any public outcry about them doing that. The average person doesn't even know who the current CEO of McDonald's actually is. ^t-00-00-42

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=87" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-01-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But however, given a different scenario, if out of nowhere, McDonald's announced that they were getting rid of the Big Mac, that they were changing their French fries, and they were doing away with their chicken nuggets, there would probably be a reaction to that. People would be pretty angry. It would probably start trending. And it's because the reality is nobody actually cares about the corporate structure. But if you change the menu items, that actually changes the substance of the company for people. A very recent example of that, by the way, is the Cracker Barrel scandal, which was hilarious, but it was a good point for everybody to learn, right? ^t-00-01-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=122" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-02-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Corporates over at Cracker Barrel effed around, and they found out pretty quickly that that old man on the logo, that inanimate old man that was with the cracker and the barrel, actually had more meaning to the public than their entire corporate division. They were ready to just walk away from it all because they got rid of the old man and his barrel. Now, I raise this only to say that I have seen multiple political organizations within recent years, especially when money starts pouring in, right? There's this like arrogance that sets in, and they start to delude themselves into believing that they're smarter than their customers, that they're smarter than their audience, so to speak, right? ^t-00-02-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=166" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-02-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Like the magic is actually the corporate structure. Audiences, I want to be very clear, will catch a vibe pretty quickly. Audiences are smart; they're perceptive. They will sense when something is off. And the harder that you try to convince them that their senses are not real and that they are imagined, the more obvious it actually becomes to them that their suspicions are correct. Something's not right. Now, to just keep up with the same analogy, Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was essentially the old man on the Cracker Barrel logo. People were invested in Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). We have at this moment no definitive understanding of what happened on the day that he was assassinated. But what we do know definitively ^t-00-02-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=209" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-03-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** is that the feds are lying to us. That is obvious; it is abundant. If you're able to think thoughts, you recognize that something is very wrong with the story that has been presented to the public. And I think that what the public doesn't understand, and I count myself among the public, is why it seems as though Turning Point USA executives—and I'll say "seems"—are not even remotely interested in challenging that official narrative. I'm not interested in challenging it publicly, at least. In fact, I think it was an X user that pointed out; he put it rather bluntly when he said, "So they want us to forgive Tyler Robinson, but to attack the people that are trying to solve the murder of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk)?" ^t-00-03-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=255" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-04-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Like, that's not right. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel good. Threats of lawsuits. We're collecting evidence of it. What are we even talking about? And I want to say that what's been bothering me in particular are the micro lies. It seems that they're suddenly in the business of telling micro lies: tiny little misrepresentations, tiny little half-truths that right out of the gate seem altogether unnecessary. It really makes me wonder, who are they protecting exactly? You'll see oftentimes they and other influencers will invoke Erica as the reason that it's not appropriate to ask questions. It's just not appropriate while Erica is still mourning for you guys to ask any questions. ^t-00-04-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=298" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-04-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I'm just gonna come back at you with some common sense. What sort of widow wouldn't want people to investigate the assassination of their husband? She has not explicitly said that, but the influencers are invoking that. Right, they're invoking like, "You just—it's not appropriate right now for people to be asking questions." That's what I mean when I say they are David hogging us, okay. You could also use another example: somebody that was on the right, Kyle Kashuv. What it essentially means is that when a tragedy takes place and we are all—we are emotional, our emotions are raw—me especially. I think this was the first time where I couldn't really check my emotions. I'm just now like moving out of the grief stage. ^t-00-04-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=339" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-05-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** There will be people that then will try to manipulate you, right? They will try to manipulate you by using that strategy of saying, "Well, it would be really wrong. It would be really wrong for you to look beneath this layer or to ask a question about this. And it would be an injustice to Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) legacy, really. If you really loved him, then you shouldn't do this, okay? Because the tragedy just happened." And they did this: David Hogg—you're not allowed to question David Hogg—like he suddenly became an authority. And no matter what he said, we were kind of told by the journalists that it just made perfect sense and he should go to Harvard. ^t-00-05-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=378" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-06-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You know, obviously to the extent that anybody suffers and survives a school shooting, I'm with you. And I think that that's totally fair. But then when you go beyond that, it starts to feel a little bit like you're emotionally manipulating us and that you're actually trying to silence people who have valid questions or criticisms or concerns. That strategy, like I said, it worked on me in the beginning. I was definitely completely worked by it. And I was feeling like even though I knew that they were telling white lies, that I should just allow it and instead focus my entire attention on just unpacking the federal lies. ^t-00-06-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=417" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-06-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But you know what? Over the weekend, I realized actually no—lying full stop is weird. It's weird after a tragedy. It is weird after someone that you purport to be your best friend—you're so close. Why are you telling micro lies about that person? And actually, by exposing those lies, perhaps it will reveal a bigger picture, because what would motivate it? What would actually motivate it? Now, I'll give you just one example here, and we're going to get into some stuff that's rather bombastic if I'm being frank. But one example that I bit my tongue on a couple of weeks ago was when influencers randomly went on ^t-00-06-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=455" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-07-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** a full attack—like full attack mode—against me when I very casually—you guys watching this series, very casually—mentioned that Catholics were hoping that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was going to take the next step and convert. Like, of course, I'm Catholic. Of course, what would be wrong with me sharing that? Everybody was sharing their stories about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and the conversations they were having. But for some reason, Candace (Candace Owens) saying—and I'll sum it up, effectively it was like two sentences: "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was going through some spiritual changes towards the end. Catholics were hoping that he'd take the next step because he was praying the rosary." I never said he converted, because he didn't. That would have been dishonest. But people were somehow really angry. Somebody clearly hit the panic button. Suddenly a bunch of videos were being made disputing the narrative. ^t-00-07-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=497" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-08-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** People were going, "I knew Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and he was truly evangelical to his core. Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah." And I want to tell you this: it felt coordinated. It felt fake. It felt unnecessary. But most importantly, it was untrue. Okay, it wasn't true. And I'm going to share with you some more truth so that you can contextualize it. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was attending Mass weekly. He was sometimes even attending Mass daily. He was not attending Pastor Rob McCoy's church. As I mentioned before, yes, he was praying the rosary. Charlie (Charlie Kirk), in fact, was wearing the St. Michael pendant when he died, okay? As has already been publicized, Erica took a Catholic bishop with her to pray over his body on the day that he died. ^t-00-08-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=542" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-09-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** These are all indisputable facts. And it is also a fact, which was presented by Megyn Kelly, that a few weeks before his death, Erica had a priest come over to pray over them when some witches thought it would be funny—whatever—to put a hex on him. Okay. That's a lot of things that were happening behind the scenes. And the people at Turning Point USA knew those things to be true. Okay, they knew everything that I just shared with you; they knew for a fact. So I was a bit astonished when Andrew Colvett and Alex Clark similarly jumped in, in this inauthentic attempt to dissuade the idea that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was softening on Catholicism. ^t-00-09-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=584" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-09-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It read to me like just sheer hatred of Catholics for no reason at all. Here's what they said; I'll jog your memory. I want you to listen to this now in the context of all of the additional details that I just shared with you, okay? Take a listen. ^t-00-09-44

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=596" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-09-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** (Alex Clark clip:) "Was he becoming Catholic? No. But he really loved Catholic Mass. He loved the ritual of it. He loved the beauty of old Catholic churches and the stained glass. And him and Erica would go sometimes. Well, Erica is a cradle Catholic, but she ended up kind of like me. I grew up Catholic. First Communion and went to Catholic high school. But then I ended up becoming a Christian in college through a Protestant church, through a non-denominational kind of more experience. It was actually Presbyterian, and then it was kind of non-non-non-denominational. And I think Erica kind of follows that same path. She and I share that. ^t-00-09-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=637" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-10-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Also, by the way, I just want to draw attention to—she's posted a photo of her and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and the kids in Mass before, and somebody in the comment section said, 'Oh, are you guys converting?' And she said, 'No, we just like attending sometimes.' So she herself had said no. Yeah. And I think Charlie (Charlie Kirk), one of the things Charlie (Charlie Kirk) really hated: worshiping in like a gym, you know, or some sort of kind of blank space that you just turn into church. I don't—there's no problem. He didn't have a problem with the act of that. He just didn't prefer it. And he loved, again, the ritual, the ancient, you know, feel of a Catholic Mass and the fact that everybody around the world that was worshipping as a Catholic—he loved. He loved that. ^t-00-10-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=679" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-11-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** So he had some really big theological hangups with that. You can go check the videos out—him debating with Michael Knowles, you know, in good fun. I mean, they were dear friends, but they loved kind of debating the whole Protestant versus Catholic thing." ^t-00-11-19

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=693" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-11-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, given everything that I've shared with you, does that conversation register as like totally and completely authentic, or kind of trying to be like, "Yeah, no, like, he loves the architecture of things, but beyond that, nothing was happening"? Like, that's not fully honest. And it registered to me like a cover-up of sorts. And I was wondering like, what are we exactly covering up? Like, I wasn't going Catholic gang gang; wasn't trying to bring back a 30 Years' War. I was just sharing the communications that I had with him. And now I felt like suddenly so many people were racing to establish that his legacy was anything but Catholic—Catholic, right? Like he was super-de-duper Judeo-Christian. And ironically, it was Judeo-Christianity that I was challenging him on, ^t-00-11-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=737" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-12-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** personally, like privately. And I was speaking to him about the political pressures of it, the way that I felt—because of last year—that it registered to me like more of a cult than a true theology or a religion, or a religious aspect, rather. And it was back in February of this year when out of nowhere, he's the one that actually messaged me and said, "Catholicism is sounding better and better," in February of 2024. This is kind of when we started having that discussion. "We should chat soon; Catholicism is looking better and better," okay? I then offered back to him a chart just showing how the phrase "Judeo-Christianity" kind of is really associated with the dawn of the nation of Israel, right? And we did chat about it. ^t-00-12-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=781" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-13-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We talked about it a lot, and I was thrilled—like I said—and I was being honest that he was attending Mass, okay? But I want to again state that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was not attending Rob McCoy's church. He was attending Mass, so it registered to me again as somewhat disingenuous when Pastor Rob McCoy came out and effectively asked me to—you know—stop looking into all of the things that happened in the lead-up to Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination, or at least asking me to pause it—rather, would be more fair of an interpretation—until the memorial, right? I'm going to jog your memory here. Here is what Pastor Rob McCoy (Pastor Rob McCoy) wrote on his Instagram after I exposed the now infamous Hamptons meeting which took place. (Pastor Rob McCoy clip:) He wrote this: "Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was my friend, and I was his pastor. ^t-00-13-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=824" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-13-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I want to simply say this regarding Candace (Candace Owens). Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was a friend to Candace (Candace Owens) and never publicly spoke poorly of her, although he disagreed with her. He never operated nor entertained gossip or innuendo concerning Candace (Candace Owens). My only comment I offer regarding Candace (Candace Owens) is this: I only wish that at this tragic time of mourning, she would be the friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) that he was to her. He would never have treated Candace (Candace Owens) or her family in such a way had—God forbid—this tragedy been hers. A friend loves at all times. Proverbs." Now, I want to be very clear. If Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a friend of mine, I sure hope if I was assassinated in front of the world that he would raise hell to figure out what actually took place on that day. That's not being a friend. A friend is not someone who stays silent when lies are being told by the federal government. That's not a friend. Again, emotionally manipulative. ^t-00-13-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=869" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-14-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The family can't have you finding out who actually killed him. The family can't have you looking into those things—of who was pressuring him behind the scenes. That's just—that's not good for the family. It bothers me. I have to be honest with you; that bothers me. I don't even like that to the untrained eye, he's kind of representing himself or representing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) as like a current congregant of his church. I feel like a lot this year, I have been feeling as though these pastors are just not as honest as they should be, right? Is that the vibe? Like, a lot of pastors are not really so concerned with the truth, is what I would say. So we should zero in here on Rob and what his motivations might be. ^t-00-14-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=914" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-15-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Why did he decide to post this after I revealed that Hamptons meeting? Well, you should know—I think most people do—that both his son and his daughter-in-law work for Turning Point USA. So whether you want to represent that or not, they have a financial stake in the future of the company. He heads up the faith division. So Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) faith and what direction it was going into would actually matter, right? It would actually matter if Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—and I never said he was going to—decided one day to become Catholic. It would have financial implications, to be clear. I never had a conversation that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was in the process of converting. Okay. But Rob in particular knew for an absolute fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was done with Israel bullying him. ^t-00-15-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=958" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-15-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's what bothers me so much about this man. Him allowing these headlines—"Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) pastor speaks out," you know, "crushes Candace (Candace Owens) because of what she said"—not whatever. I don't like it. He knew. And others knew that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was done with Israel bullying him. And I am now going to present you proof of what I am saying. This is an actual group chat which happened two days before Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. There were nine people in total on this chat, including Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Rob McCoy. I'm going to protect the names of the other seven for now. ^t-00-15-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=993" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-16-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** To be clear, I might actually release a name every day this week, but I want to show you this because, suffice it to say, Rob McCoy was on this text thread. And I think it helps contextualize him as a person—in my view—that he would attack me for telling the truth about the pressure that he was facing. Take a look. (Group chat clip:) So Charlie (Charlie Kirk) writes in this group chat, "Just lost another huge Jewish donor—two million a year—because we won't cancel Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I'm thinking of inviting Candace (Candace Owens)." Somebody writes, "Oh." Charlie (Charlie Kirk) writes, "Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes. I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause." ^t-00-16-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=1037" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-17-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Then somebody writes—Sedona writes—"Please do not invite Candace (Candace Owens). That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term. In my opinion, like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions. That nasty free will thing that God bestowed on us makes life frustrating at times. After the dust settles a bit, maybe." So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination. He was very clear, and he was very explicit, and he did not back down—not in that Hamptons meeting, which they're all lying about, nor in this text thread. I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven. Actually, you know what? I disagree with myself four seconds ago. Let's just throw in Josh Hammer, for funsies. He's on this chat, okay. So what are we to make of that? ^t-00-17-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=1076" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-17-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, now that I'm showing you this and showing to you that the conversations were real, I want you to reflect. And it took me a lot of patience to allow the lies that were being woven and the misrepresentations of people that were pretending that I was just—what?—high on lying about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and the pressure he was under, the attacks that not just me—Tucker (Tucker Carlson), Megyn Kelly—faced for trying to stand up and tell the truth about what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was actually going through. Why are you hearing it, though, from me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and Megyn Kelly? Is that weird? You got people that are hosting a show. Have they in like one honorable thing come out and said like, "You know what? F a couple of these donors who made his life a living hell in the last couple of weeks"? Why haven't they done that? ^t-00-17-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=1123" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-18-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So also a rabbi in that chat—like, why hasn't anybody made that move to at least say, to vindicate what I have been saying about what he was going through?

Can we all agree? You should not grieve by lying and gaslighting the public. They want us to believe that the only way that we can support and honor Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) legacy is by donating our money, but it would not be supportive for us to try to figure out who killed him and why the feds are lying.

One of our dear friends that literally from the very beginning started with us and loved Charlie (Charlie Kirk) like a brother—he grabbed the SD cards out of the camera afterwards. And there's all these conspiracy videos about, 'Why did he grab the SD cards?' Well, first of all, they're in the possession of the FBI. Okay. It's not like he took them and like ran off with them. Second of all, I asked him personally. I said, 'Why did you do that?' And he looked at me, and this was his answer. He said, 'Because I know people can be evil,' and he did not want that footage being grabbed by somebody. There was videos of people after the incident going and stealing hats off the table. ^t-00-21-37

Thank you for saying that. Yeah, thank you, Tucker (Tucker Carlson), for saying that. And this is the reason why Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is so big, because he has this perspective. He understands what the average person is thinking here, and the average person looks at that and thinks it's shady. And, you know, saying that there was this heart-wrenching moment where you were worried because people were stealing stuff on the table, but also you took the SD card out and not the very expensive camera—which is, if you were worried about stealing and theft, maybe you would take the camera. But more importantly, there is—he says that the feds—that he gave it to the feds, right? And he doesn't insinuate—obviously—that they don't have the footage. Turning Point does have the footage; that's very clear. ^t-00-23-09

It was being live-streamed. But what he said actually conflicts with what Tyler Boyer is about to say—what he said over this weekend, okay? Tyler Boyer, like I said, he's a COO of Turning Point Action, and he went on this kind of bender—worst kind of bender, Twitter bender—defending the organization. He thought he was defending them against public sentiments, during which time he refutes what Andrew Colvett is saying about the SD cards. Andrew says the Turning Point employee was worried about theft, but Tyler says that actually he was instructed to secure the SD cards before the campus went on to lockdown. ^t-00-23-46

Somebody said, rightfully, "Emotional manipulation and falsely equating scrutiny as some form of hate speech is not going to work here. You and Colvett admitted that the staff tampered with cameras and the most crucial video evidence in the largest political assassination in decades. Hiding makes them look guilty." And Tyler countered, "Dude did not tamper with anything—as he did, it's a crime scene. The law enforcement officers asked them to turn them over immediately so they didn't get lost in commotion before they took everyone into lockdown." Now that is just not true. That is not true. What Tyler is saying is not true. ^t-00-24-30

And the answer that I was given sounded more like what Andrew Colvett said. "You know, I was emotional. I knew that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was dead. And my instinct," he told me, "was to make sure that I secured the footage so that Erica would not have to see it again. Like, he didn't want Erica to have to see it and have to relive it." That is what he said to me on the phone. Nothing about police officers. No one's ever heard "Police officers asked them to secure the footage before lockdown" until Tyler Boyer tweeted this weekend.

He doesn't share when or where exactly that happened. I think people feel you're being dishonorable by not questioning the narrative, but I haven't read anybody that's explicitly accused them of murder. In fact, the tweets that he's responding to all seem to be pretty fair, in my opinion, you know? ^t-00-25-51

Like, file an FOIA; get that footage; keep it simple." And he responds and he says, "Guys, there's camera footage all over that campus that the police have, plus all the cameras that we had. They likely won't release it until the trial." Now there's just one problem with that narrative, right? If they have all this footage and they're just not releasing it because they just want to—what? ^t-00-26-27

What's wrong with that narrative is the manhunt that took place. If indeed they have tons of footage from all these different angles, and some of it in 4K—which they do—this is why we've been saying that you're lying from day one—then the first time that that footage should have been deployed was during the 33-hour manhunt, right? Why didn't they release more footage at that time? If they were actually interested in catching the killer, why only release a blurry image when there is—as he mentions—footage everywhere, all over that campus, every inch? Are we supposed to honestly believe at that time their thought process in the middle of a manhunt was, "Well, let's not release too much except for a blurry image, ^t-00-27-11

And if they're somehow vindicated by the footage—if you're like, "I released the footage of him jumping down on the center and I show him firing the shot, but like that totally vindicates him"—then you got the wrong guy, right? Having more footage, examining more footage, and examining more evidence should further incriminate Tyler Robinson. ^t-00-28-22

Common sense is what I said from the beginning. Release the footage, which you do have in your possession. It's not like just the feds have this footage. Release the footage, because then people will move on from quote-unquote conspiracies. So everything they're saying right now doesn't make sense. They're not smarter than the public, right?

But before we do that, I'm gonna throw it to a couple of our sponsors. First, Preborn. Because I have watched many people that I'm close with be vilified because they've stood up for truth. I have felt the sting of injustice myself, but I've also felt something else, which is courage. I'm done playing defense.

Third thought: "Thank God Trump (Donald Trump) is president"—like MAGA? Did you go MAGA? Did you go like, "I'm glad he knows the Lord," and then MAGA? What are we missing here? Does that feel okay at all? It goes on to say she praises the FBI director, Kash Patel, and his deputy Dan Bongino for their leadership in the hunt for the suspect. "What's so crazy is that we have them in office because of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)," Clark said. So honor the feds, quick pic outside, and also MAGA—MAGA hard.

MAGA." I didn't feel that way. Didn't feel that way. In fact, I was angry. I remember feeling angry when Trump (Donald Trump) moved to kind of do a same-time post—Benjamin Netanyahu—and then published a picture of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) with an Israeli flag behind. I was pretty angry about that. I thought, yuck—that's gross. Have you no dignity and respect? Post a picture of him with his family, you know? ^t-00-38-56

It was gross. But anyways, I just—I don't know why. I don't know why, but the people that are critiquing us for investigating the murder are not critiquing themselves; are not holding a mirror to themselves. Anyways, Alex has decided to share a total half-truth PR spin on another tweet from Tyler Boyer, where he responds to someone asking about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) establishing a DOJ department. Again, we presented that to the public. We showed the internal email, the internal memo that went out. It was Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in his own words. We showed the whole email. ^t-00-39-32

And here's what Tyler says about that: (Tyler Boyer tweet quote:) "She took a sentence and made something up. TPUSA does an audit every year—always has. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) constantly looked for ways to make everything we do more efficient. That's TPUSA. It operates eight times more effectively than any other similar operation." So what did I make up when I shared an email and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said he wanted to establish a new DOJ department? Why would he call it new if he was doing it every year? And wow, what foresight you had as a company that's been around for like 10 years or more—maybe more than 10 years—that you were doing DOJ since the beginning? ^t-00-40-13

The audit has F all—okay, F all—to do with DOJ. The audit is what 501(c)(3)s are instructed to do. Get an independent auditor and audit yourselves or else the IRS will hound you. Now, when you are auditing yourselves, I will guarantee you the Clinton Foundation audited themselves annually. That does not mean that there is not corruption. It does not mean—it means that you're doing things that are above board from a government perspective. It does not mean that within your own organization there is not corruption. That is the reason for a DOJ department, ^t-00-40-57

Nobody—when he established DOJ with Vivek Ramaswamy—was thinking that he was going in there because he was going to see if they're violating the IRS laws. No, I think he went in there to see wasteful spending and to see where the money was going—where our tax dollars were going. That's the vibe I got. So they're relying on us to be—again—financially illiterate, to not understand how it works. I shared a 501(c)(3) lawyer with them. So I met her in her offices with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and she explained the reasons why she said that you got to get an independent auditor. I actually think that for organizations of a certain size, you're required by law to do an annual audit if you're 501(c)(3). I think it's state by state that guides that. ^t-00-41-32

I have a feeling some people are going to die on that sword, because the reality is that in big companies, inevitably, you will find corruption. And I'm hearing some stuff, okay? A lot of contractors—that's something that you can do— as just one example that's completely legal but utterly immoral—is if you're outsourcing all of the millions of dollars to contractors and you're getting kickbacks. That's just one example, okay? So I take money from donors and then I show that I'm paying out to a contractor who doesn't work for Turning Point USA, but that contractor is then somehow paying me back. That would be something that wouldn't flag the IRS, ^t-00-42-16

I hope that clarifies matters. Now, shifting gears only slightly, I don't often—or really ever—speak about my faith journey, right? Because I'm still on it, and I don't want to make a mistake or be wrong. And in many ways, I kind of feel like this pressure that I don't want to let Catholics down because I don't know everything. And I prefer the people that have been Catholic forever to speak on things as I'm still a student. ^t-00-42-58

You're seeing it right now, right? Judeo-Christian after Judeo-Christian making videos: "Candace (Candace Owens)..." It's like cult-like behavior. You can't leave, right? There's only one way out of here. People quoting scripture to actually fulfill what became quite obvious to me was just their political lens. And yeah, people taking money to do that. ^t-00-43-24

So what are your motives here? If you're citing scripture to defend the actions of Benjamin Netanyahu, you're a fraud. Of course you're a fraud. And if you're accepting money to do that in the process, you're worse than a fraud. Anyways, I want to show you guys this clip that someone sent me. This was a sermon which was given by a pastor on September 21st, 2025. Now it's not necessary to name the Judeo-Christian pastor, right? I'm never trying to put any fire on them, because I actually think what they're doing is important—because I find out about all of these sermons because their congregants are sending them to me. ^t-00-44-05

I want you to listen to this pastor's words, because you might too feel similarly inspired to recognize that something is wrong. And I want to also be clear here: it's not every pastor. It's going to be fair for me to say that. But pastors that have a very strong political bent— something's not right there, all right? Now to tee this up, the title of his sermon is "What Has Defiled You?" And he has decided for this particular sermon to pull from Paul's letter to the Corinthians, and that specific biblical passage that he cites is chapter 7, verse 1. And it reads—the Bible reads—"Therefore, beloved, ^t-00-44-43

Now, you don't need to be a priest or a pastor to think right now about what you might perceive is the point of that passage. Probably thinking through it. Yeah, yeah—it's important. Body, spirit. Probably not what you're thinking right now is that this has something to do with Megyn Kelly. You're probably not thinking Paul wrote this letter to the Corinthians because there's a point that he wants to prove about Megyn Kelly. But he's going to get there. That's how this pastor is going to get there. He's going to explain that. Take a listen. ^t-00-45-28

There wasn't a narrative that was so prevalent right now with foolish people that are so deceived, like a Candace (Candace Owens) and like a Nick Fuentes, and young people are eating that up and they're changing their philosophy on what these people say that do not—do not base your ideology unless somebody has a Bible open.

It's wrong, and it's also deranged.

But it's also pretty tough on our skin, and it's the end of the summer sun, the new autumn wind, and it can leave us—our skin especially—looking tired, dry, dull. So if you're looking in the mirror and feeling like your skin has lost its radiance for the season, then I'm gonna tell you guys about my go-to—which you guys know is Neemi Skincare. Neemi is the reason that my skin stays clear, firm, and glowing no matter what the weather brings. Their three-step anti-aging routine is the perfect defense for this seasonal shift. It's packed with powerful, clinically backed ingredients that work to restore your skin's barrier—which is exactly what you need to fight off that dry autumn air. It also boosts collagen production to help with those fine lines. It locks in deep moisture, and it brightens your complexion, bringing back that healthy glow that you had in the summer. Here's why I love them most: because they're American-made. ^t-00-53-51

Well, you should know that there is good news, because they've created the Smart Equity Loan—which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage.

Melissa Forberg, similarly, with a really nice donation here: "Spent the weekend researching the Kabbalah. It was, to say the absolute least, terrifying. Thank you." Yes, it is very important. Of course, if you are in my book club, we're about to really get into it, by the way. ^t-00-56-38

I don't know where David Bakan's children are—the author of the book; he is Jewish himself—but I just want them to know that they're blocking money from you. They don't want the public to read this book—which you can download and find it online for free—but like still, it's pretty crazy that they are now realizing people are catching on. That book will dive into the Kabbalah. It's very important to know. Similarly, like I've said from the beginning, we have different denominations within Christianity. That's kind of what this whole episode has been about. I don't know why one—like, I don't know why so many evangelicals have such vitriol for Catholics. The feeling is not mutual. Genuinely, the feeling is not mutual on the Catholic side or on the Orthodox side. ^t-00-57-20

There just are. And we don't realize that. We don't know what they believe in. We just go, "Oh, well, it's Judaism. It's the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible." No. There's also the Talmud. There's also the Kabbalah. And to just not actually study and understand all of those differences—it makes us extremely ignorant and very likely to be indoctrinated into one of those religions, convinced that it's actually modern science—which is what's actually happening, I think. We kind of live in a Kabbalist society more than anything else. And I think that this book that we're going to read will help you get there. We really have—we go there in the book club. We go there. And so if you'd like to join the book club, we're starting a new book tomorrow. ^t-00-58-04

We will wrap up this last book that we read, which is similarly terrifying, which is The Assault on Truth. The scales will fall from your eyes if you read The Assault on Truth—to understand how they will lie to protect the most evil people in the entire world. You have to destroy your belief system about Sigmund Freud, and then you're ready to learn about what Sigmund Freud actually—what his major contribution was—and that's the book we're diving into next. Sigmund Freud and the Jewish Mystical Tradition is the name of that book by David Bakan that we will be starting on tomorrow's book club. Lauren Hulin writes, "You mentioned the suspicious way so many of the individuals surrounding Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) case are new to their role. ^t-00-58-47

We are all being lied to." Yeah, it's almost like they're like actors. You know what I mean? You're going to just play the role of sheriff when we do this thing. You're going to play the role of this, and everyone's going to be so new. It's pretty lame. It is pretty lame. Again, questions—we're allowed to ask them. Exposed to Truth writes, "I have been a Catholic my whole life and attended a non-denominational church once and found it to be cringy like that pastor that you showed the video of. Keep fighting for truth. I'm sure Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is cheering you on from heaven, praying for you." You know, actually, to tell you how emotional I was after Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) death—was really just not myself, obviously. But I was upset. ^t-00-59-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=3609" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:00:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-01-00-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I was almost upset with my priest, because I went on Sunday and I expected him to like say something about Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk)—which is not what he should be doing. Like, you can dedicate a Mass to somebody, but he didn't say anything about Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). And I was like, oh—like, I don't like that. And now that I've removed from that, I actually appreciate that. That is what I actually find that I love about the Catholic religion: there's no political bent there. Like, that is what I love. And I attend, you know, the Latin Mass. And what I was upset with, I now really appreciate in retrospect—that you know, there's no drop of politicism when you're in the room. Jennifer Barney writes, "I admire you so much. It's easy to drop something and go with the flow. Don't drop this. Something is not right. Thank you, Candace (Candace Owens), for being our voice." I'm grateful. I'm actually so grateful I can be your voice. ^t-01-00-09

And again, I'm so grateful to Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I think he's also one of our voices. He immediately interjects, and he's like, "Well, let's be fair here. The feds have lied about everything—always. So why should we think this is different? Especially when they're dropping these weird text messages." So yeah, I'm grateful that you guys trust me to be your voice. And obviously you guys, we're kind of all on the same squad here. So it's because of the information that you're giving me that I'm able to even platform it. So I owe—I have—so much gratitude for you guys as well. Every morning I start the day with gratitude, and I always say how grateful I am ^t-01-00-55

So from the bottom of my heart, I do want to say thank you to you guys. Moderator Marzi writes, "Rob O'Neill, the guy who shot Bin Laden, questions the story of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on Piers Morgan's show. Also the South African ambassador to France was found dead in a Paris hotel." Oh no, France. France. It's hot right now, France. France is... You guys already know. Look, I want to say this. I want to say this. Make sure I read all of this. Oh, iBudget also asked, "What's the update on your Australian visa status? I want to answer that real quickly. ^t-01-01-35

The Supreme Court of Australia heard—I don't think it's called the Supreme Court; you guys call it something else, but it is your Supreme Court—heard our arguments, and we are still awaiting a decision. Obviously we can't rush them in their decision. So you will be the first to know when we hear back. Speech is on the line, but of course, we will always respect the decision of any country. We've never been in trouble. So it's weird that I can't travel to Australia. It's very strange to me. Everybody else can travel to Australia that's been in tons of trouble. But that is the power of truth when it is spoken. That is what is so amazing. All of the money in the world that Israel has, the money that they spent on influencers, people that have been assassinated by trying to get them to register under FARA, presidents—everything that they have done— ^t-01-02-20

That is why free speech is important, right? That is why it is the single thing that they want to attack first—is because truth when spoken— that's Christ. Christ is truth, right? It is that powerful. And that's something to be amazed by—to be amazed that they are scrambling, and they want us to stop speaking and to stop communicating and to shut down communications. It shows you the power—the power of Christ, truly. I will say in closing and going back to France: if I found Brigitte's penis, I will find who killed Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). ^t-01-03-04
