Today we are going to discuss, or rather I'm going to introduce to you, a psychological strategy that I refer to as "David hogging." Some of you guys remember <span id="ent-person-david-hogg-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-david-hogg.md">David Hogg</a></span> of the <span id="ent-event-parkland-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/event-parkland.md">Parkland</a></span> shooting tragedy. Of course you do. Well, it seems like <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> is now engaging in this strategy of David hogging the public. And I<span id="event-event-2018-02-14-parkland-school-shooting-tragedy-involving-david-h-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2018-02-14-parkland-school-shooting-tragedy-involving-david-h.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> want it to be clear that it is downright manipulative, and I've really had enough of it. Frankly, what happened over the weekend is that their <span id="ent-org-tp-action-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-tp-action.md">TP Action</a></span> COO, <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span> Bowyer, went on a little bit of an X binge. I don't recommend it, which was then highlighted by <span id="ent-person-alex-clark-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-alex-clark.md">Alex Clark</a></span>, who has a show over there on <span id="ent-org-instagram-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-instagram.md">Instagram</a></span>.<span id="event-event-2025-09-18-wall-street-journal-publishes-article-featuring-al-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-18-wall-street-journal-publishes-article-featuring-al.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-00-42.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:42</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=42" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I think it's therefore fair for us to turn our attention back to them. So welcome back to <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a><span id="event-event-2025-09-21-pastor-delivers-sermon-criticizing-candace-owens-a-t-00-00-42"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-21-pastor-delivers-sermon-criticizing-candace-owens-a.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> (<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-42"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> Owens). So let me put it to you this way. I'll give you a different scenario. If at this very moment, McDonald's publicly announced that their CEO was stepping down and they were going to replace him with somebody else, nobody would care, right? Like, there's not going to be any public outcry about them doing that. The average person doesn't even know who the current CEO of McDonald's actually is. ^t-00-00-42

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-01-27.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=87" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But however, given a different scenario, if out of nowhere, McDonald's announced that they were getting rid of the Big Mac, that they were changing their <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-01-27"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> fries, and they were doing away with their chicken nuggets, there would probably be a reaction to that. People would be pretty angry. It would probably start trending. And it's because the reality is nobody actually cares about the corporate structure. But if you change the menu items, that actually changes the substance of the company for people. A very recent example of that, by the way, is the <span id="ent-org-cracker-barrel-t-00-01-27"><a href="/entities/org-cracker-barrel.md">Cracker Barrel</a></span> scandal, which was hilarious, but it was a good point for everybody to learn, right? ^t-00-01-27

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-02-02.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:02</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=122" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Corporates over at <span id="ent-org-cracker-barrel-t-00-02-02"><a href="/entities/org-cracker-barrel.md">Cracker Barrel</a></span> effed around, and they found out pretty quickly that that old man on the logo, that inanimate old man that was with the cracker and the barrel, actually had more meaning to the public than their entire corporate division. They were ready to just walk away from it all because they got rid of the old man and his barrel. Now, I raise this only to say that I have seen multiple political organizations within recent years, especially when money starts pouring in, right? There's this like arrogance that sets in, and they start to delude themselves into believing that they're smarter than their customers, that they're smarter than their audience, so to speak, right? ^t-00-02-02

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-02-46.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:46</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=166" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Like the magic is actually the corporate structure. Audiences, I want to be very clear, will catch a vibe pretty quickly. Audiences are smart; they're perceptive. They will sense when something is off. And the harder that you try to convince them that their senses are not real and that they are imagined, the more obvious it actually becomes to them that their suspicions are correct. Something's not right. Now, to just keep up with the same analogy<a href="/events/event-2025-09-08-charlie-kirk-group-chat-reveals-losing-2m-jewish-d.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><a href="/events/event-2025-09-08-charlie-kirk-group-chat-reveals-losing-2m-jewish-d.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2025-09-08-charlie-kirk-group-chat-reveals-losing-2m-jewish-d-t-00-02-46"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-08-charlie-kirk-group-chat-reveals-losing-2m-jewish-d.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-46"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk) was essentially the old man on the <span id="ent-org-cracker-barrel-t-00-02-46"><a href="/entities/org-cracker-barrel.md">Cracker Barrel</a></span> logo.

That is obvious; it is abundant. If you're able to think thoughts, you recognize that something is very wrong with the story that has been presented to the public. And I think that what the public doesn't understand, and I count myself among the public, is why it seems as though <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-03-29"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> executives—and I'll say "seems"—are not even remotely interested in challenging that official narrative. I'm not interested in challenging it publicly, at least. In fact, I think it was an X user that pointed out; he put it rather bluntly when he said, "So they want us to forgive<span id="event-event-2025-09-08-charlie-kirk-group-chat-reveals-losing-2m-jewish-d-t-00-03-29"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-08-charlie-kirk-group-chat-reveals-losing-2m-jewish-d.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-03-29"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>, but to attack the people that are trying to solve the murder of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-29"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk)?" ^t-00-03-29

It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel good. Threats of lawsuits. We're collecting evidence of it. What are we even talking about? And I want to say that what's been bothering me in particular are the micro lies. It seems that they're suddenly in the business of telling micro lies: tiny little misrepresentations, tiny little half-truths that right out of the gate seem altogether unnecessary. It really makes me wonder, who are they protecting exactly? You'll see oftentimes they and other influencers will invoke <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-04-15"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> as the reason that it's not appropriate to ask questions. It's just not appropriate while <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> is still mourning for you guys to ask any questions. ^t-00-04-15

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-04-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=298" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I'm just gonna come back at you with some common sense. What sort of widow wouldn't want people to investigate the assassination of their husband? She has not explicitly said that, but the influencers are invoking that. Right, they're invoking like, "You just—it's not appropriate right now for people to be asking questions." That's what I mean when I say they are David hogging us, okay. You could also use another example: somebody that was on the right, <span id="ent-person-kyle-kashuv-t-00-04-58"><a href="/entities/person-kyle-kashuv.md">Kyle Kashuv</a></span>. What it essentially means is that when a tragedy takes place and we are all—we are emotional, our emotions are raw—me especially. I think this was the first time where I couldn't really check my emotions. I'm just now like moving out of the grief stage. ^t-00-04-58

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-05-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=339" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** There will be people that then will try to manipulate you, right? They will try to manipulate you by using that strategy of saying, "Well, it would be really wrong. It would be really wrong for you to look beneath this layer or to ask a question about this. And it would be an injustice to <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-39"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk's (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk's) legacy, really. If you really loved him, then you shouldn't do this, okay? Because the tragedy just happened." And they did this: <span id="ent-person-david-hogg-t-00-05-39"><a href="/entities/person-david-hogg.md">David Hogg</a></span>—you're not allowed to question <a href="/entities/person-david-hogg.md">David Hogg</a>—like he suddenly became an authority. And no matter what he said, we were kind of told by the journalists that it just made perfect sense and he should go to Harvard.<span id="event-event-2025-09-18-wall-street-journal-publishes-article-featuring-al-t-00-05-39"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-18-wall-street-journal-publishes-article-featuring-al.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-05-39

And I think that that's totally fair. But then when you go beyond that, it starts to feel a little bit like you're emotionally manipulating us and that you're actually trying to silence people who have valid questions or criticisms or concerns. That strategy, like I said, it worked on me in the beginning. I was definitely completely worked by it. And I was feeling like even though I knew that they were telling white lies, that I should just allow it and instead focus my entire attention on just unpacking the federal lies. ^t-00-06-18

Over the weekend, I realized actually no—lying full stop is weird. It's weird after a tragedy. It is weird after someone that you purport to be your best friend—you're so close. Why are you telling micro lies about that person? And actually, by exposing those lies, perhaps it will reveal a bigger picture, because what would motivate it? What would actually motivate it? Now, I'll give you just one example here, and we're going to get into some stuff that's rather bombastic if I'm being frank. But one example that I bit my tongue on a couple of weeks ago was when influencers randomly went on ^t-00-06-57

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-07-35.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=455" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** a full attack—like full attack mode—against me when I very casually—you guys watching this series, very casually—mentioned that Catholics were hoping that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-35"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk) was going to take the next step and convert. Like, of course, I'm Catholic. Of course, what would be wrong with me sharing that? Everybody was sharing their stories about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk) and the conversations they were having.

Catholics were hoping that he'd take the next step because he was praying the rosary." I never said he converted, because he didn't. That<span id="event-event-1967-06-05-six-day-war-between-israel-and-arab-states-t-00-07-35"><a href="/events/event-1967-06-05-six-day-war-between-israel-and-arab-states.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> would have been dishonest. But people were somehow really angry. Somebody clearly hit the panic button. Suddenly a bunch of videos were being made disputing the narrative. ^t-00-07-35

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-08-17.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:17</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=497" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** People were going, "I knew <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-17"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk) and he was truly evangelical to his core. Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah." And I want to tell you this: it felt coordinated. It felt fake. It felt unnecessary. But most importantly, it was untrue. Okay, it wasn't true.

As has already been publicized, <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-08-17"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> took a Catholic bishop with her to pray over his body on the day that he died. ^t-00-08-17

Well, <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> is a cradle Catholic, but she ended up kind of like me. I grew up Catholic. First Communion and went to Catholic high school. But then I ended up becoming a Christian in college through a Protestant church, through a non-denominational kind of more experience. It was actually Presbyterian, and then it was kind of non-non-non-denominational. And I think <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> kind of follows that same path.

And, you know, saying that there was this heart-wrenching moment where you were worried because people were stealing stuff on the table, but also you took the SD card out and not the very expensive camera—which is, if you were worried about stealing and theft, maybe you would take the camera. But more importantly, there is—he says that the feds—that he gave it to the feds, right?

Why didn't they release more footage at that time?

It's going to be fair for me to say that. But pastors that have a very strong political bent— something's not right there, all right? Now to tee this up, the title of his sermon is "What Has Defiled You?" And he has decided for this particular sermon to pull from Paul's letter to the Corinthians, and that specific biblical passage that he cites is chapter 7, verse 1.

No. There's also the Talmud. There's also the <span id="ent-concept-kabbalah-t-00-58-04"><a href="/entities/concept-kabbalah.md">Kabbalah</a></span>.

And so if you'd like to join the <a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a>, we're starting a new book tomorrow. ^t-00-58-04

We will wrap up this last book that we read, which is similarly terrifying, which is <span id="ent-work-the-assault-on-truth-t-00-58-47"><a href="/entities/work-the-assault-on-truth.md">The Assault on Truth</a></span>. The scales will fall from your eyes if you read <a href="/entities/work-the-assault-on-truth.md">The Assault on Truth</a>—to understand how they will lie to protect the most evil people in the entire world. You have to destroy your belief system about <span id="ent-person-sigmund-freud-t-00-58-47"><a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a></span>, and then you're ready to learn about what <a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a> actually—what his major contribution was—and that's the book we're diving into next. <a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a> and the <span id="ent-concept-jewish-mystical-tradition-t-00-58-47"><a href="/entities/concept-jewish-mystical-tradition.md">Jewish Mystical Tradition</a></span> is the name of that book by <span id="ent-person-david-bakan-t-00-58-47"><a href="/entities/person-david-bakan.md">David Bakan</a></span> that we will be starting on tomorrow's <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-58-47"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>. Lauren Hulin writes, "You mentioned the suspicious way so many of the individuals surrounding <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-58-47"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk's (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk's) case are new to their role. ^t-00-58-47

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-00-59-29.md" class="timestamp-link">00:59:29</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=3569" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I live in <span id="ent-gpe-dallas-t-00-59-29"><a href="/entities/gpe-dallas.md">Dallas</a></span>, and I noticed after the Ice shooting that Daniel Cato, the <a href="/entities/gpe-dallas.md">Dallas</a> police chief, is new to the role as of April. We are all being lied to." Yeah, it's almost like they're like actors. You know what I mean? You're going to just play the role of sheriff when we do this thing. You're going to play the role of this, and everyone's going to be so new. It's pretty lame. It is pretty lame. Again, questions—we're allowed to ask them. Exposed to Truth writes, "I have been a Catholic my whole life and attended a non-denominational church once and found it to be cringy like that pastor that you showed the video of. Keep fighting for truth. I'm sure <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-59-29"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk) is cheering you on from heaven, praying for you." You know, actually, to tell you how emotional I was after <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk's (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk's) death—was really just not myself, obviously. But I was upset. ^t-00-59-29

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-01-00-09.md" class="timestamp-link">01:00:09</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=3609" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I was almost upset with my priest, because I went on Sunday and I expected him to like say something about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-01-00-09"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk)—which is not what he should be doing. Like, you can dedicate a Mass to somebody, but he didn't say anything about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk). And I was like, oh—like, I don't like that. And now that I've removed from that, I actually appreciate that. That is what I actually find that I love about the Catholic religion: there's no political bent there. Like, that is what I love. And I attend, you know, the Latin Mass. And what I was upset with, I now really appreciate in retrospect—that you know, there's no drop of politicism when you're in the room. Jennifer Barney writes, "I admire you so much. It's easy to drop something and go with the flow. Don't drop this. Something is not right. Thank you, <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> (<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-01-00-09"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> Owens), for being our voice." I'm grateful. I'm actually so grateful I can be your voice. ^t-01-00-09

And again, I'm so grateful to <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-01-00-55"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>. I think he's also one of our voices. He immediately interjects, and he's like, "Well, let's be fair here. The feds have lied about everything—always. So why should we think this is different? Especially when they're dropping these weird text messages." So yeah, I'm grateful that you guys trust me to be your voice. And obviously you guys, we're kind of all on the same squad here. So it's because of the information that you're giving me that I'm able to even platform it. So I owe—I have—so much gratitude for you guys as well. Every morning I start the day with gratitude, and I always say how grateful I am ^t-01-00-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-01-01-35.md" class="timestamp-link">01:01:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=3695" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** for the platform that I have been given by God and the people that have invested in me by just watching and hearing what I'm saying and standing up for me when I can't stand up for myself because I'm being attacked from every which direction. So from the bottom of my heart, I do want to say thank you to you guys. Moderator Marzi writes, "Rob O'Neill, the guy who shot Bin Laden, questions the story of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-01-01-35"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk) on Piers Morgan's show. Also the South African ambassador to <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-01-01-35"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span> was found dead in a <span id="ent-gpe-paris-t-01-01-35"><a href="/entities/gpe-paris.md">Paris</a></span> hotel." Oh no, <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a>. <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a>. It's hot right now, <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a>. <a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a> is... You guys already know. Look, I want to say this. I want to say this. Make sure I read all of this. Oh, iBudget also asked, "What's the update on your Australian visa status? I want to answer that real quickly. ^t-01-01-35

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ozWJz2spBcI/t-01-02-20.md" class="timestamp-link">01:02:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozWJz2spBcI&t=3740" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Your Australian fans need you." The Supreme Court of <span id="ent-gpe-australia-t-01-02-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-australia.md">Australia</a></span> heard—I don't think it's called the Supreme Court; you guys call it something else, but it is your Supreme Court—heard our arguments, and we are still awaiting a decision. Obviously we can't rush them in their decision. So you will be the first to know when we hear back. Speech is on the line, but of course, we will always respect the decision of any country. We've never been in trouble. So it's weird that I can't travel to <a href="/entities/gpe-australia.md">Australia</a>. It's very strange to me. Everybody else can travel to <a href="/entities/gpe-australia.md">Australia</a> that's been in tons of trouble. But that is the power of truth when it is spoken. That is what is so amazing. All of the money in the world that <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-01-02-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> has, the money that they spent on influencers, people that have been assassinated by trying to get them to register under <span id="ent-law-fara-t-01-02-20"><a href="/entities/law-fara.md">FARA</a></span>, presidents—everything that they have done— ^t-01-02-20

That is why free speech is important, right? That is why it is the single thing that they want to attack first—is because truth when spoken— that's Christ. Christ is truth, right? It is that powerful. And that's something to be amazed by—to be amazed that they are scrambling, and they want us to stop speaking and to stop communicating and to shut down communications. It shows you the power—the power of Christ, truly. I will say in closing and going back to <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-01-03-04"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">France</a></span>: if I found <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-01-03-04"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a></span>'s penis, I will find who killed <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-01-03-04"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk) Kirk (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk) Kirk). ^t-01-03-04
