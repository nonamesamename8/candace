Happy Tuesday. I gotta tell you something. <span id="ent-org-twitter-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-twitter.md">Twitter</a></span>, or X, it hasn't really been that fun in a really long time. I think <span id="ent-person-elon-musk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-elon-musk.md">Elon Musk</a></span> clearly gave it away to the military, and we now have to suffer these military bot farms calling for war with <span id="ent-gpe-iran-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-iran.md">Iran</a></span>. But last night, the platform was exceptional. It was amazing. The tears that were being shed all over the place. I mean, I really picked out the best responses to me dropping the text <span id="claim-claim-bb2cc178c7d1-t-00-00-00">messages. It was hilarious. Anyway, <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> has responded to the release of the messages, so we are going to watch that.<a href="/claims/claim-bb2cc178c7d1.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> Spoiler alert: they were real, of course. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-00-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=39" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And on top of that, a <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-39"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> donor has published a public letter regarding me, and I was truly touched by it. I think you will be too, so I wanna share that. Welcome back to Candace. My little sister called me this morning, and she was like, "Candace, your podcast right now is like the show <span id="ent-work-succession-t-00-00-39"><a href="/entities/work-succession.md">Succession</a></span> on HBO." You guys know<span id="event-event-2025-10-06-candace-owens-releases-screenshots-of-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-39"><a href="/events/event-2025-10-06-candace-owens-releases-screenshots-of-charlie-kirk.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> this show, which is about how all of the heirs are supposed to be kind of fashioned after Rupert Murdoch's throne. ^t-00-00-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-01-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=82" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** All the siblings are fighting one another to see who will it be? Who will it be that gets this empire? That really made me chuckle. I think that should be our new show intro. Yes, yes, yes. Who will succeed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-22"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>? Who shall inherit the <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-01-22"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> throne? You know what, you guys? The best part of all of this for me is unlike those ill-begotten heirs on the show, I have 0% interest in <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s empire. I'm not motivated by the idea of carrying on his torch. ^t-00-01-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-02-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=125" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Not for a single moment did I think any person could carry on his torch. If you thought you could, you clearly did not know <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was, in fact, an anomaly in the system. It happens rarely. And yeah, I don't know that I will live to see another person like him. I want you guys to know something. I want to share this with you. You can take it or you can leave it, but <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was betrayed. I know this. I've known this really since the first second, but I rarely have vivid dreams. And I did in fact have a very vivid one over the weekend. In fact, the last time that I had a super vivid dream, I was pregnant. It tends to happen a lot to women when they're pregnant. ^t-00-02-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-02-46.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:46</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=166" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But in that dream from <span id="ent-date-2023-t-00-02-46"><a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a></span>, my former producer on the show and I were standing in the control room, and she told me that she was 26 weeks pregnant. This is in the dream. And she told me exactly what month the baby was coming. I asked her in the dream, "Is it a boy? Is it a girl?" And she said, "It's a boy." I woke up, and I immediately texted my producer in real life, and I said, "Hey, you're pregnant. Just so you know, it's a boy." And then she found out that she was pregnant one week later. She had no idea when I texted her. And it's something that we reflected on a couple of months later because she was just totally shocked looking back on it. And this is our text chain from <a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a>. You can see. She said, "You texted me June 16th, and I think I got pregnant June 26." "This is crazy. ^t-00-02-46

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-03-30.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:30</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=210" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And it's going to be a boy." "It's nuts." I said, "I'm telling you, your baby visited me." It was an insanely vivid dream. He was on his way. And she said, "That is so bizarre. My mom also texted me that week saying that she had a dream I was pregnant." I said, "I haven't had a dream that vivid since. It's been my only vivid dream this entire pregnancy." I believe people can communicate in dreams on their way in and on their way out of this world. I similarly, like I just said, had a vivid dream this weekend, and <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> came to me, and he told me that he was betrayed. And so for me, you don't have to believe that, but I do believe that. And it was the immediate sense I got actually, ^t-00-03-30

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-04-11.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=251" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** and I don't know who exactly it is that betrayed him. But I also felt in the dream that it is soon going to be revealed—that it's actually inevitable that it is going to be revealed—that there is nothing and no one that is going to stop the truth from coming out, and it is going to have international consequences. Take that to the bank. Quote me on that. Women tend to have a stronger intuition about people, I would say. I think it was the writer-producer <span id="ent-person-conrad-flynn-t-00-04-11"><a href="/entities/person-conrad-flynn.md">Conrad Flynn</a></span> that recently went on to <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-04-11"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>'s show, and he discussed that phenomenon in the context of the persecution of Christ. He's talking about Pontius Pilate's wife warning him not to persecute Jesus. Take a listen to that portion of their conversation. (Clip: <a href="/entities/person-conrad-flynn.md">Conrad Flynn</a> and <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a>) ^t-00-04-11

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-04-56.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:56</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=296" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Conrad Flynn:** And if you look at Pontius Pilate, at some point he flips, and he's like, "You know, this guy is innocent. My wife is having dreams about this man." That's another thing that's underreported in history: wife as soothsayer slash dreamer. I mean, your wife has many times been like, "I have a bad feeling about this guy, <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>." "Don't have him on your show." And her intuition is such that even though there's no necessarily hard evidence, you know, it's your wife's take on stuff. You don't ignore it. But that's... ^t-00-04-56

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-06-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=366" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It's actually really funny because I'm recapping conversations that I've had with <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-06-06"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> where I'm like, "I don't know why you trust that person at all. He's obviously a bad guy." And he's like, "Really? I like him, but I had a really nice dinner with him." Anyways, obviously what they're accurately describing—especially between a husband and a wife, definitely my relationship with my husband—I can say that from almost the very moment that I learned that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was not going to make it, I said to George through tears that he was betrayed. And now we're all just sort of on this journey to find out by whom. So I released a text message yesterday—dropped it on the world—and it caused (and this is putting it mildly) a lot of panic. As I said, the chatter on X was top tier. ^t-00-06-06

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-06-51.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:51</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=411" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Emphasis on the tears because there were a lot of tears being shed by everyone who was discounting me. "She's this. She's that. She's lying." "<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-51"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> never changes mind." "He was committed to <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-06-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> to the day he died." "In fact, he almost died for <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a>." That was the vibe they were putting down. I was getting angrier and angrier and angrier, but self-control always pays off. There were moments on X where people were—after this text message was revealed—almost like bargaining: "Like, please, this can't be real." "Let me show you. They're making fake messages themselves." "This is how easy it is to make a fake message. This cannot be real." They were accusing, deluding themselves into believing whatever was necessary for them not to accept the reality that I was telling the truth. ^t-00-06-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-07-35.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=455" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Of course, I was telling the truth. Here's just a few of my favorites. This is Village Crazy Lady, who I love—Mel—who was responding to an absurdity that was being presented by Ashton Forbes. Mel said, "These losers are down so bad right now that they are literally using their own attack lines for defense." Ashton Forbes wrote, "He's been absolutely maniacal. First off, Candace has no credibility. Second, there's a bunch of <span id="ent-org-telegram-t-00-07-35"><a href="/entities/org-telegram.md">Telegram</a></span> group chat scams that claim to be real people. I was briefly in touch with one <span id="ent-person-elon-musk-t-00-07-35"><a href="/entities/person-elon-musk.md">Elon Musk</a></span>." Oh, really? You were in touch with <a href="/entities/person-elon-musk.md">Elon Musk</a> on <a href="/entities/org-telegram.md">Telegram</a>? "Third, if you discount the text messages between <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-07-35"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> and his trans furry lover, you cannot take these at face value.<span id="event-event-2025-09-12-authorities-apprehend-suspect-tyler-robinson-33-ho-t-00-07-35"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-12-authorities-apprehend-suspect-tyler-robinson-33-ho.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-07-35

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-08-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=500" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Lastly, even if the text messages were real, they mean literally nothing related to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s death. I find it scary how Candace is building a literal cult. Soon, they'll be drinking Kool-Aid in sync with—I don't even know if that says 31 Atlas—to be sent to heaven." I think that might be a cult, actually. That's how I'm not in a cult at all—so much I don't even recognize. It was probably a very big cult's name. And I love that Mel replies and says, "Bro, if I got scammed in a <span id="ent-org-telegram-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/org-telegram.md">Telegram</a></span> group chat by '<span id="ent-person-elon-musk-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/person-elon-musk.md">Elon Musk</a></span>' quote-unquote, I'd take that ish to my grave." Britta—you can see she's also replying. He was replying to Britta: "No soup for Knowles" if you want to bring that right back up. She wrote, "By the way, she used to work for <span id="ent-person-seth-dillon-t-00-08-20"><a href="/entities/person-seth-dillon.md">Seth Dillon</a></span>." ^t-00-08-20

She wrote, "Is <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> posting fake group chat screenshots to conveniently back up her narrative that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-04"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was dropping the pro-<span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-09-04"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> cause and inviting <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> to the <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-09-04"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a></span> stage?"

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-09-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=583" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** We all know she's the first to run her mouth, and she wrote, "Because I don't give an F about <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-09-43"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span> and her postpartum psychotic rants. Even if those texts are real, it still does not mean that <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-09-43"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> killed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-43"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>." I never said that. "<a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a> makes content for low IQ people who don't understand how criminal investigations work. It's going to be hilarious when she is sued by <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-09-43"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a></span> in addition to McCrone's wife." Yes, bankrupt her for telling the truth. Do it. Do it. Bankrupt her. Yeah. When you are down bad—just like Mel says—when they're really down bad, nothing is left. You just sue. ^t-00-09-43

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-10-21.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:21</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=621" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Anyways, back to how unhinged the chatter was on X generally speaking. I laughed out loud. Everybody uses the term "blitzkrieg." Even in the NFL, football teams say "blitzkrieg." Yes, it relates. Um, back to Germany—it's a bombardment strategy. So that's why we use it when you're going to bombard. And so I called it blitzkrieg week because we're just dropping a bunch of bombs, and Britta decided to take that literally. She said, "Candace thinks it's cute to use Nazi terminology and make a <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-10-21"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> pun while she incites further harassment of <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a> employees by implicating them in <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-21"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s death. It's a sick game for her." ^t-00-10-21

I have no idea why <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a> is being just invoked. It's like these people just get drunk and beat <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a> when they get home. I don't know what is happening and why she's being dragged into anything that I say, but it's exceptional that they're now looking—they're so desperate. German words—you can't even say "blitz" means lightning, "Krieg" means war. Last I checked, people are still allowed to speak German, and last I checked, everybody uses the terminology "blitz," "blitzkrieg."

Yeah, so it's—it has been so frustrating to have people blow up about this, and you know, we've stated—I've certainly stated publicly—the reason I haven't waited on things is I am an eyewitness to events, and they said, "Don't comment on things because anything you say can mess that up." I don't want to mess up any trial for the person who did this. That's a thousand percent right. And I will say, I wasn't an eyewitness. I was not there.

I am sure he had very little sleep. And like I say, never the fun thing to be the spokesperson and also to be involved in the story. I can tell you right off the bat: he is telling the truth. He was not the person who shared that message with me. He also should know that he was not the only person who sent that message and sent messages around. So there are a lot circulating, some videos that are circulating. And yeah, he's being honest about that portion.

We actually spoke literally the night before his tragic and untimely death. I was on a small Zoom<a href="/claims/claim-b5f5479ef70b.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> call with him and a couple others. We were literally talking through this topic. I was giving <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> advice for how to message on this issue on his forthcoming campus tour. He kind of jokingly mentioned to me—he was like, 'Josh, I'm going to mention your book, <span id="ent-work-israel-and-civilization-t-00-24-12"><a href="/entities/work-israel-and-civilization.md">Israel and Civilization</a></span>, and it's so good.' And that was literally our last conversation. It's just so tragic. This letter that he wrote to the prime minister, Chris—I read back in June or July or so. And there were so many people in the aftermath of his horrific assassination—<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-24-12"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span>, folks like that—who were saying that, oh, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was turning on <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-24-12"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>. ^t-00-24-12

But this letter that he wrote to <span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-24-50"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Bibi</a></span> Netanyahu, Chris—literally begins—the first sentence of the letter is (I'm paraphrasing here, but it's a close paraphrase), 'As a Christian, one of my greatest joys in life is making friendships with the Jewish people and defending the state of <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-24-50"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>.'" That's literally the opening sentence of this letter. Filth, okay? ^t-00-24-50

I don't understand it. I can't comprehend it. Whatever that is that lives in him does not live in me. There was no truth in him. Obviously there was no truth in <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-25-20"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span>. He could have said, "Well, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-25-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was going through—48 hours earlier." Yeah, he refused to do that. In fact, I'm quite alarmed with what I know: that there are three people who said that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> communicated 24 hours before he died that he thought they were going to kill him. Now I find it rather alarming that <a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a> is similarly saying, "Oh, the night before." So you spoke to him the night before. Did he communicate that to you, <a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a>? Did he? I'm interested. ^t-00-25-20

There will be no place that you can hide. Anyways, I want you guys to know that I was feeling so inspired by <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-25-58"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span>'s utter lack of human decency that I went ahead this week and sent around a life insurance policy of sorts—a package rather—to people that I trust: a package filled with text messages, emails, private communications, videos, and private legal documents. ^t-00-25-58

People that are trying to bankrupt me—trying to bankrupt me and my family—that are threatening us, to sue us. Everything that <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-26-42"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span> said was so real, okay? I'm now at that point where you look back and you go, "Man, <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a> was right." He was really saying something about what it takes to leave. You know, to fight for custody of your own soul. Just leave me alone. Let me say what I believe, and you say what you believe. Fight fair. Why do you always have to make this threat to bankrupt people? ^t-00-26-42

It's necessary. And I highly recommend every single person that is out there—that has a platform and is going through things and scared—do the same. Send everything around to about eight people that you trust. And I mean, I've arranged it. I sent it to journalists—text messages and screenshots—to people ranging from <span id="ent-person-max-blumenthal-t-00-27-17"><a href="/entities/person-max-blumenthal.md">Max Blumenthal</a></span> to Andrew Tate.

We have been proven right so many times in the recent past, right? Whether we're speaking about <span id="ent-event-covid-19-pandemic-t-00-27-54"><a href="/entities/event-covid-19-pandemic.md">COVID</a></span>—people that had to actually take a stance before the government then suddenly admits: 'Oh yeah, we were lying. We were lying about this. We were lying about that." We feel it all right now. The feds are lying. That is beyond obvious, which is why I was very happy to hear former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill explain this plainly when he went on Piers Morgan's show the other day. Let's take a listen to what he had to say. (Clip: Rob O'Neill) ^t-00-27-54

Do we not guard rooftops anymore? There's been assassinations, assassination attempts all over the world. Why aren't we looking at rooftops? And then when I was sent the video at the same message where they said <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-28-35"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was just shot— when I watched that horrific video—he was obviously dead before he hit the ground. But the questions immediately started to come to me. That was not an entry wound that we saw. We saw an exit wound. So where'd that bullet come from? You don't bleed like—and I've shot guys closer than the camera was— an entry wound doesn't look like <span id="claim-claim-4f0c84441d8d-t-00-28-35">that. An exit wound does. Why did his shirt move the way it did? When I've shot people, their shirts didn't move like<a href="/claims/claim-4f0c84441d8d.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> that. And then the initial reaction was, "Well, he was obviously wearing body armor, and it was deflection." ^t-00-28-35

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-29-19.md" class="timestamp-link">00:29:19</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=1759" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Rob O'Neill:** One, no, he wasn't wearing body armor. And two, it doesn't deflect like that off of body armor. Why was his shirt moving from right to left? Why were people being interviewed saying, "Yeah, they came from my left to right—from his right to left"—immediately shut down? <span id="claim-claim-4c392223617c-t-00-29-19">And then did they tear the crime scene down immediately? Just right off the bat from seeing it—knowing<a href="/claims/claim-4c392223617c.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> he was dead—saying a lot of this is bad. Not even getting into the soliloquy of text messages that 22-year-olds don't send their trans lover. So immediately, the official story sounds like it needs to be investigated. But now the whole crime scene is gone. They paved over it. Nothing to see here. ^t-00-29-19

The soliloquy of the text messages that 22-year-olds do not send their lovers. They're lovers. Yes, that's kind of the main point, guys. We have been working off a lot of tips, and so much more is going to be exposed, and we're gonna get into that more tomorrow. I do wanna give you a quick update on Lance Twigg. And like I said, we know that the feds are lying to us. The question is: why are the feds lying to us? The answer is always the same. The feds only lie to cover their own tracks. They are protecting themselves and their bosses. Who are their bosses? Who is "they"? Anyways, take a big—a little bit of a break here because I want to read some sponsors. First and foremost, <span id="ent-org-riverbend-ranch-t-00-29-56"><a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a></span>. I tell you guys about them all the time.

Each year, <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones, without antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. ^t-00-30-40

It's an incredible scientific breakthrough to support our long-term health, wellness, and our healthy aging. Based on over 100 studies, we know that C15 strengthens our cells and is a key healthy aging nutrient which helps slow biological aging at the cellular level. When our cells don't have enough C15, they become fragile, and they age faster. Thankfully, Fatty15 repairs age-related damage to cells, protects them from future breakdown, and activates pathways in the body that help regulate our sleep, cognitive health, and naturally repair our mechanisms. Fatty15 is a science-backed, award-winning, patented, 100% pure C15 supplement. ^t-00-32-02

Fatty15 has three times more cellular benefits than Omega-3 or fish oil. It comes in a reusable glass bamboo jar, and refills are shipped right to your door. Fatty15 is on a mission to optimize your C15 levels to help support your long-term health and wellness—especially as you age.

But I want to tell you that <span id="claim-claim-02966660e9cb-t-00-34-55">I maintain—I actually believe—that this was a military hit that involved foreign actors and also literal actors.<a href="/claims/claim-02966660e9cb.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> I believe that that day ran something akin to JFK's assassination. I believe that therefore there were multiple decoys on the ground.

I do not believe that the person who ran across the Losey rooftop killed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-35-37"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. I think it was another decoy. I do not believe that shot came from a <span id="ent-org-lozier-center-t-00-35-37"><a href="/entities/org-lozier-center.md">Losey center</a></span> at all. And obviously we all know that decoy <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-35-37"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span> didn't kill <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. And I received an interesting tip about him as well: that he's much more connected than what meets the surface. He potentially has connections to <span id="ent-org-the-federal-government-t-00-35-37"><a href="/entities/org-the-federal-government.md">the federal government</a></span>—familial connections to <a href="/entities/org-the-federal-government.md">the federal government</a>—and we are prodding that.

Call it a hunch. I think <span id="claim-claim-34c0222f102e-t-00-36-12">it's much more likely that Lance Twigg is the one that is walking in that maroon shirt. His build<a href="/claims/claim-34c0222f102e.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> is nothing like <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-36-12"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>'s build. Lance Twigg is thinner. And obviously I'm speculating here, but I believe <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> was involved, and he was in fact driving around campus on that day—therefore assisting in the costume changes, likely picking up clothing. ^t-00-36-12

And what was he seen doing? As I told you: dumping clothing in the cemetery beside that Dairy Queen. So I think that is what his involvement is limited to. That was his job: to get rid of clothing. It's completely nonsense to think that a person who had never killed anyone was high on adrenaline after a kill and decided to eat Dairy Queen. That doesn't even make sense biologically speaking. There was going to be an adrenaline rush that kicks in after you kill ^t-00-36-53

It's why they are freaking out about that Dairy Queen leak because it disrupts their narrative. One of many things that disrupts their narrative. But what about Lance Twigg, right? This roommate—man, something about him. The roommate of <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-37-27"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> is, I think, federally protected.

Well, according to his family, that's just not true. According to his family, he was raided, and he was angry about that raid. And yet he was instantly released back into their care within six hours. Isn't that something? They had no idea what was happening. They were going off of Mike—the mysterious detective <span id="ent-person-mike-mitchell-t-00-38-46"><a href="/entities/person-mike-mitchell.md">Mike Mitchell</a></span>'s tip. They had no confession. They have <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-38-46"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> walking in peacefully because he doesn't want to die. And you're telling me Lance Twigg—for whatever reason—you released him immediately back into custody? No, they lied.

Now, the feds are staging this entire operation, so that would follow. And if you're trying to get a conviction, you gotta be like, "And we found this in his house: the note underneath the keyboard." So convenient—but he destroyed it. He took a picture of it, but then he destroyed it.

Obviously illegal. They were not informed that the locks were being changed. So it gives us two options: it was either Lance, or it was the feds. I was wondering: you know, if you're Lance and you really got swept up in this and you're so shocked that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-40-07"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> did this, are you speaking to your family about that?

The government has us completely distracted with photos of people who are not even the same person. I never for a second thought the person that was in the maroon shirt was the same as the person that was walking with the limp. It's completely foolish and ridiculous. I can also tell you something else. We received a tip—which I vetted—that on the day of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-40-52"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination, you know, immediately <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-40-52"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span> gets up and says, "I did it, I did it, I did it," and he kind of gets dragged. ^t-00-40-52

And he told multiple nurses and doctors that he did it because he was being paid to do it. He said he had not been paid yet, but he was going to receive payment. He didn't know from whom.

I wanted to share that with you as some other explosive things that we have found out that the feds have not shared—other people that they were questioning that they did not share—people that similarly have been told to be quiet about everything.

You know, like I—when I expressed to you that I felt that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-53-30"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s life was like The Truman Show— and then I know that's how you guys felt because we were—we were just expecting a fight. We were just expecting a fight. And instead it seems like the very things that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was fighting— lies, no matter what they were—somehow were being platformed and allowed. So thank you, John. Thank you, Irina. I cried last night reading that. I almost cried on air there reading it again. I needed it. ^t-00-53-30

I'm really excited about everything. And also, I want to add to this: Thank you guys—not just John and Irina for being the first donors that took a public stance. But before they did this, it was all of you guys at home, truly. The tags fighting for me in the comments when I was being smeared—when they even tried to wipe away my friendship: "Like she hasn't spoken to him since 2015." It was you guys. Like you—this letter is for you. Every time he says "Candace," he means all of us. All of us did this. So anyways, let me tell you guys about Tax Network <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-54-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>. Maybe you owe back taxes. Maybe your tax returns are not filed. Maybe you forgot to file for an extension. ^t-00-54-10

Many of us are relying on credit cards to cover essentials. If that debt is piling up for you, you're not alone. Americans collectively owe one trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing but hesitated because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. Well, there's good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan—a solution designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate—which means one predictable monthly payment—giving you peace of mind. The loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started with no upfront or hidden fees. Call American Financing and start saving today. ^t-00-55-38

First comment that we have is from Jennifer. Jennifer writes: "Do we know anything about the security team that was supposed to keep <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-57-49"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> alive?" I do. I have everybody's names—the people that we couldn't identify. Jennifer continues: "So many questions. Since the MO was out there due to <span id="ent-person-donald-trump-t-00-57-49"><a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Trump</a></span>, why wasn't this taken into consideration?

Corey Henry writes: "Give me the Kool-Aid in a juice box LMAO" regarding Ashton Forbes' cult comment. Yeah, it was totally crazy. I don't know what—I like. Yeah, maybe we're in a cult of truth. I don't know. Like, what's it called? Maybe Christianity? I mean, like... I want to tell the truth, so there's that. Sarah D. writes: "Keep going, Candace. Love from <span id="ent-gpe-australia-t-00-58-31"><a href="/entities/gpe-australia.md">Australia</a></span>." Thank you, Sarah.

And I only have a platform because I keep telling the truth, you know? If I had lied—if I had sold my soul, which many people have done—I wouldn't have earned your trust. And so, yeah, it comes at a cost. It certainly comes at a cost. The last two weeks have been very hard, but it also comes at an even more amazing reward. Justine Lowe writes: "As soon as you said he was betrayed, I knew it was true. My female intuition at work—brought me to tears and prayed for your safety." Thank you. He was. He was.

Amy writes: "Most Holy Theotokos, bless and protect the handmaid of God, Candace, and her family. Candace, so many of us in the Orthodox Christian community are praying for you.

And I want to be clear: I'm not saying that as a potshot to other denominations. But it feels like there's been a lot of persecution, and a lot of this for some reason has involved—as I showed you yesterday—you know, pastors that have been a part of this, like part of spreading these lies. And that is—it's not good. It's just not good to have pastors using the Bible to lie. It's just not okay. Maheen Siddiqui writes: "I think it would be interesting to do a deep dive into how the term 'Judeo-Christian' came about. I'm aware of it. It seems to be a very convenient word for <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-01-00-26"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>."

I was working for <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-01-01-09"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a></span> entities. So I don't fault us our ignorance. That is how the deception is thick, you know? And we're finally piercing through that layer for the first time. Will Wallace writes: "Decoy boy, please reach out to Candace people for the tea. Gang gang is inquiring." We feel like we know, but we don't know now, right? I agree. Eldah MJ writes: "Rooting for you from Malaysia and praying for your safety. You are so brave." Thank you.

Yeah, I think we have to be brave. And I'm a real Christian. I know this life is not it. I know it's not it. And in fact, people I know have intentionally been trying to convince us that this is it so that they can further commit you to their matrix—to get you to agree to sell your soul, to get you to agree to lie because you're so worried about things that are in this world. I know that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-01-01-52"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s soul was removed from his body, and I know that he's watching, and I keep that in mind.

Linda writes: "Girl, you made me cry. God bless you. I'm praying for you. Ave Maria." Thank you. John and Irina made me cry, so it's really their fault. If you want to be angry at anybody, you can be angry at John and Irina for writing that. I did. I felt the Holy Spirit in those words. I really did. It's how we're all feeling. Turtle Mama writes: "I enjoy listening to your content, and I feel so at peace with the information that you share as truth. Sending prayers for Mississippi and stay safe." Thank you so much, Turtle Mama. We're all actually doing this thing. So thank you guys for supporting me on this journey. Thank you for all of you guys that have signed up at CandaceOwens.com, bought yourself a hat, a t-shirt, joined our CIA—the decentralized—which is more of a threat, by the way.

And that's why I sent out that little packet to people that I trust, and I sent screenshots to Max.
