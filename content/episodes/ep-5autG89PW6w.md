**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. Happy Tuesday. I gotta tell you something. Twitter, or X, it hasn't really been that fun in a really long time. I think Elon Musk clearly gave it away to the military, and we now have to suffer these military bot farms calling for war with Iran. But last night, the platform was exceptional. It was amazing. The tears that were being shed all over the place. I mean, I really picked out the best responses to me dropping the text messages. It was hilarious. Anyway, Turning Point USA has responded to the release of the messages, so we are going to watch that. Spoiler alert: they were real, of course. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=39" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-00-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And on top of that, a Turning Point USA donor has published a public letter regarding me, and I was truly touched by it. I think you will be too, so I wanna share that. Welcome back to Candace. My little sister called me this morning, and she was like, "Candace, your podcast right now is like the show Succession on HBO." You guys know this show, which is about how all of the heirs are supposed to be kind of fashioned after Rupert Murdoch's throne. ^t-00-00-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=82" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-01-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All the siblings are fighting one another to see who will it be? Who will it be that gets this empire? That really made me chuckle. I think that should be our new show intro. Yes, yes, yes. Who will succeed Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Who shall inherit the Turning Point throne? You know what, you guys? The best part of all of this for me is unlike those ill-begotten heirs on the show, I have 0% interest in Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s empire. I'm not motivated by the idea of carrying on his torch. ^t-00-01-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=125" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-02-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Not for a single moment did I think any person could carry on his torch. If you thought you could, you clearly did not know Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was, in fact, an anomaly in the system. It happens rarely. And yeah, I don't know that I will live to see another person like him. I want you guys to know something. I want to share this with you. You can take it or you can leave it, but Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was betrayed. I know this. I've known this really since the first second, but I rarely have vivid dreams. And I did in fact have a very vivid one over the weekend. In fact, the last time that I had a super vivid dream, I was pregnant. It tends to happen a lot to women when they're pregnant. ^t-00-02-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=166" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-02-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But in that dream from 2023, my former producer on the show and I were standing in the control room, and she told me that she was 26 weeks pregnant. This is in the dream. And she told me exactly what month the baby was coming. I asked her in the dream, "Is it a boy? Is it a girl?" And she said, "It's a boy." I woke up, and I immediately texted my producer in real life, and I said, "Hey, you're pregnant. Just so you know, it's a boy." And then she found out that she was pregnant one week later. She had no idea when I texted her. And it's something that we reflected on a couple of months later because she was just totally shocked looking back on it. And this is our text chain from 2023. You can see. She said, "You texted me June 16th, and I think I got pregnant June 26." "This is crazy. ^t-00-02-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=210" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-03-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And it's going to be a boy." "It's nuts." I said, "I'm telling you, your baby visited me." It was an insanely vivid dream. He was on his way. And she said, "That is so bizarre. My mom also texted me that week saying that she had a dream I was pregnant." I said, "I haven't had a dream that vivid since. It's been my only vivid dream this entire pregnancy." I believe people can communicate in dreams on their way in and on their way out of this world. I similarly, like I just said, had a vivid dream this weekend, and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) came to me, and he told me that he was betrayed. And so for me, you don't have to believe that, but I do believe that. And it was the immediate sense I got actually, ^t-00-03-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=251" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-04-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** and I don't know who exactly it is that betrayed him. But I also felt in the dream that it is soon going to be revealed—that it's actually inevitable that it is going to be revealed—that there is nothing and no one that is going to stop the truth from coming out, and it is going to have international consequences. Take that to the bank. Quote me on that. Women tend to have a stronger intuition about people, I would say. I think it was the writer-producer Conrad Flynn that recently went on to Tucker (Tucker Carlson)'s show, and he discussed that phenomenon in the context of the persecution of Christ. He's talking about Pontius Pilate's wife warning him not to persecute Jesus. Take a listen to that portion of their conversation. (Clip: Conrad Flynn and Tucker Carlson) ^t-00-04-11

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=296" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-04-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** And if you look at Pontius Pilate, at some point he flips, and he's like, "You know, this guy is innocent. My wife is having dreams about this man." That's another thing that's underreported in history: wife as soothsayer slash dreamer. I mean, your wife has many times been like, "I have a bad feeling about this guy, Tucker (Tucker Carlson)." "Don't have him on your show." And her intuition is such that even though there's no necessarily hard evidence, you know, it's your wife's take on stuff. You don't ignore it. But that's... I have ignored it. You're like, "I've actually never listened to that." I know. I mean, I've been married 34 years as of Saturday. And it's like a joke in my house. "You know, I told you he was bad." I don't know. ^t-00-04-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=340" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-05-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** He's hilarious. He's like a good guy to me. That's hilarious. You'd be the Pontius Pilate where she's like, "Don't arrest this man. I had a dream." And you're like, "Whatever. I'm doing my work right now." I'm very shallow, so someone who's amusing or fun to have dinner with—I just get swept away. I like that guy. You know what I mean? You're like, "Brabus was amazing on that podcast. I got to have him on." "He's fantastic." ^t-00-05-40

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=366" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-06-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's actually really funny because I'm recapping conversations that I've had with Tucker (Tucker Carlson) where I'm like, "I don't know why you trust that person at all. He's obviously a bad guy." And he's like, "Really? I like him, but I had a really nice dinner with him." Anyways, obviously what they're accurately describing—especially between a husband and a wife, definitely my relationship with my husband—I can say that from almost the very moment that I learned that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was not going to make it, I said to George through tears that he was betrayed. And now we're all just sort of on this journey to find out by whom. So I released a text message yesterday—dropped it on the world—and it caused (and this is putting it mildly) a lot of panic. As I said, the chatter on X was top tier. ^t-00-06-06

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=411" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-06-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Emphasis on the tears because there were a lot of tears being shed by everyone who was discounting me. "She's this. She's that. She's lying." "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never changes mind." "He was committed to Israel to the day he died." "In fact, he almost died for Israel." That was the vibe they were putting down. I was getting angrier and angrier and angrier, but self-control always pays off. There were moments on X where people were—after this text message was revealed—almost like bargaining: "Like, please, this can't be real." "Let me show you. They're making fake messages themselves." "This is how easy it is to make a fake message. This cannot be real." They were accusing, deluding themselves into believing whatever was necessary for them not to accept the reality that I was telling the truth. ^t-00-06-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=455" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-07-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Of course, I was telling the truth. Here's just a few of my favorites. This is Village Crazy Lady, who I love—Mel—who was responding to an absurdity that was being presented by Ashton Forbes. Mel said, "These losers are down so bad right now that they are literally using their own attack lines for defense." Ashton Forbes wrote, "He's been absolutely maniacal. First off, Candace has no credibility. Second, there's a bunch of Telegram group chat scams that claim to be real people. I was briefly in touch with one Elon Musk." Oh, really? You were in touch with Elon Musk on Telegram? "Third, if you discount the text messages between Tyler Robinson and his trans furry lover, you cannot take these at face value. ^t-00-07-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=500" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-08-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Lastly, even if the text messages were real, they mean literally nothing related to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s death. I find it scary how Candace is building a literal cult. Soon, they'll be drinking Kool-Aid in sync with—I don't even know if that says 31 Atlas—to be sent to heaven." I think that might be a cult, actually. That's how I'm not in a cult at all—so much I don't even recognize. It was probably a very big cult's name. And I love that Mel replies and says, "Bro, if I got scammed in a Telegram group chat by 'Elon Musk' quote-unquote, I'd take that ish to my grave." Britta—you can see she's also replying. He was replying to Britta: "No soup for Knowles" if you want to bring that right back up. She wrote, "By the way, she used to work for Seth Dillon." ^t-00-08-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=544" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-09-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So this is the usual chatter, a group of people. She wrote, "Is Candace posting fake group chat screenshots to conveniently back up her narrative that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was dropping the pro-Israel cause and inviting Candace to the TPUSA stage?" "I'm just asking questions." All fair. We allow questions. We even allow diagnoses. We're chill. We're on the side of truth. We are so chill. Laura Loomer, who is legally just—you know—not allowed to own a gun because she's a literal lunatic, had the nerve to post this about me. When somebody called her out, Morgan Ariel said, "Laura Loomer hasn't made a single post about Candace Owens reporting on Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s group messages." ^t-00-09-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=583" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-09-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We all know she's the first to run her mouth, and she wrote, "Because I don't give an F about Candace Owens and her postpartum psychotic rants. Even if those texts are real, it still does not mean that Israel killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." I never said that. "Candace Owens makes content for low IQ people who don't understand how criminal investigations work. It's going to be hilarious when she is sued by TPUSA in addition to McCrone's wife." Yes, bankrupt her for telling the truth. Do it. Do it. Bankrupt her. Yeah. When you are down bad—just like Mel says—when they're really down bad, nothing is left. You just sue. ^t-00-09-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=621" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-10-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Anyways, back to how unhinged the chatter was on X generally speaking. I laughed out loud. Everybody uses the term "blitzkrieg." Even in the NFL, football teams say "blitzkrieg." Yes, it relates. Um, back to Germany—it's a bombardment strategy. So that's why we use it when you're going to bombard. And so I called it blitzkrieg week because we're just dropping a bunch of bombs, and Britta decided to take that literally. She said, "Candace thinks it's cute to use Nazi terminology and make a Turning Point pun while she incites further harassment of TPUSA employees by implicating them in Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s death. It's a sick game for her." ^t-00-10-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=663" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-11-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And out of nowhere, Megyn Kelly needs to stop making excuses for this vile behavior. I have no idea why Megyn Kelly is being just invoked. It's like these people just get drunk and beat Megyn Kelly when they get home. I don't know what is happening and why she's being dragged into anything that I say, but it's exceptional that they're now looking—they're so desperate. German words—you can't even say "blitz" means lightning, "Krieg" means war. Last I checked, people are still allowed to speak German, and last I checked, everybody uses the terminology "blitz," "blitzkrieg." Washington Post certainly does when they're describing things that are happening at the White House. But now this is how desperate they are for anything—grasping at straws. ^t-00-11-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=707" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-11-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Nick Fuentes, our routine federal informant, writes this: "Why did she sit on this for four weeks and then censor the other names?" So just grasping at straws. Just grasping at straws here. Follow that up by taking a stab at Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who's dead: "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said he had no choice to leave the pro-Israel cause because a Jewish donor stopped giving him millions of dollars." What a coincidence. "He had his great epiphany about Israel after they stopped paying him to shill." Speaking of paying people to shill, it's why I didn't take one minute—or one sentence rather—of him trying to eulogize Charlie (Charlie Kirk) seriously, because that right there is the real Nick Fuentes. The Quartering jumped in. He says, "A serious question: ^t-00-11-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=748" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-12-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Let's assume the texts are real and that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was 100% serious and not just being sarcastic—which is totally possible. What exactly does this prove? Think before you reply." "What does it prove other than someone close to him was fine leaking his texts?" That's been their new talking point: "How dare you leak text messages?" And finally, this is just funny, so we're going to show you this. Community Notes for the win. The Misfit Patriot writes, "I will give Candace every single shekel Israel has paid me for my posts if she can prove those text messages are real." Update, says Community Notes: "Andrew Kolvet confirmed the screen grab was real." Of course it was real. I mean... I would have to be the dumbest person ever. ^t-00-12-28

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=792" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-13-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** First off, I'm not even inclined towards tech, but also would have to be an absolute moron to try to figure out how to manufacture text messages for the purpose of releasing them to then probably get sued by every person that was not in the chat. Like I'm just like, "Hey, Josh Hammer received this message." That'd be so dumb. But like I said, these people were desperate for it not to be real because they've been lying so hard about everything. They've just been lying, and they have some egg on their face now. And reality hit them pretty quickly this morning when Andrew Kolvet, Turning Point's spokesperson, confirmed that the messages were in fact real. He did this on the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) show. ^t-00-13-12

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=830" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-13-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And actually, I don't think it's dramatic to state that this may be the first respectable measure taken by Turning Point USA executives since the passing of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—like the first respectable response. And yeah, I thought that that was—I will—I will compliment that. Just the action of Andrew Kolvet addressing it head-on instantly was good. So let's hear Andrew Kolvet in his own words. (Clip: Andrew Kolvet) ^t-00-13-50

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=857" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-14-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** But I want to take the start of this show to address some of the things that have been going around on public—namely about a group text chain that has been made known and released by Candace Owens. And I just want to address it head-on because that was a text grab, a screen grab that I had shared uh... with people, so it—it is authentic. And I want to go into it because actually—and really excited that the truth is out there. I first want to say the reason I—I didn't share that screen grab publicly is because it was a private—it was a private exchange, and I felt like it didn't necessarily comport with things that were already public. I wanted to not betray my friend's trust in that way. ^t-00-14-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=902" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-15-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** But I did share it with some people in government because it happened really quick. It took 33 hours for authorities to get their suspect. And in those first moments, we wanted no stone unturned. We wanted to leave nothing unturned. So I shared it with a few people. Don't know where it went from there, apparently. But here we are. One of the reasons, Blake, that I'm glad to have this now public—it was not mine to share publicly—but you know, one of the criticisms we've received is that we don't care, we're not investigating every lead, we're not looking under every stone, and that somehow we're just like, you know, sweeping things under the rug. ^t-00-15-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=944" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-15-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** And when I say that we want justice for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) more than anybody else, I really mean it, and no stone unturned. I mean, I don't know if you want to chime in on that part alone, but I have more to say. Yeah, so it's—it has been so frustrating to have people blow up about this, and you know, we've stated—I've certainly stated publicly—the reason I haven't waited on things is I am an eyewitness to events, and they said, "Don't comment on things because anything you say can mess that up." I don't want to mess up any trial for the person who did this. That's a thousand percent right. And I will say, I wasn't an eyewitness. I was not there. I flew to Utah immediately to be with the family and the team, but I was not an eyewitness. So there's that. ^t-00-15-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=986" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-16-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** But I am aware that in my role as spokesman for Turning Point USA—which is another hat I wear—that things I say, I'm cognizant of the fact that things I say could negatively impact an ongoing investigation. But I will weigh in specifically on this issue of Israel because I know there's a lot of fascination. And I just want to say that, you know, we have to let free speech be our North Star here, okay? Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was adamantly free speech, and I am not personally going to impugn anybody's character who is asking questions and looking for answers, all right? And I will say that that text chain is consistent with ^t-00-16-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=1027" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-17-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** public frustrations that he voiced many times. And I know, Blake, you were in the trenches on a lot of this stuff because we were workshopping how we were going to do the tour and what we were going to get asked about Israel—what was he going to say—and this is consistent with things that he told his friends, people that are, you know, in the wider movement about his wrestle that he was going. And so I just want to say, like, what is the truth about the way Charlie (Charlie Kirk) felt about Israel? Well, it's complicated, and it's nuanced, and it was a wrestle that was going on for months, and it's probably somewhere between the Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) letter and the text. So what do we think? ^t-00-17-07

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=1067" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-17-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, obviously you can tell he's anxious. You can tell he's nervous speaking about this. I am sure it was positively frantic at Turning Point USA yesterday. I am sure he had very little sleep. And like I say, never the fun thing to be the spokesperson and also to be involved in the story. I can tell you right off the bat: he is telling the truth. He was not the person who shared that message with me. He also should know that he was not the only person who sent that message and sent messages around. So there are a lot circulating, some videos that are circulating. And yeah, he's being honest about that portion. I personally, as someone who knows Andrew Kolvet, wanna express how I feel. I hold it against him actually that he didn't share it with me. ^t-00-17-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=1111" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-18-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He knew—I cried on the phone with Andrew. He knew how I was feeling. And then I went under a very—well, you could say a blitzkrieg, right?— a heavy bombardment from people who he knows hated Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who tried to stop Charlie (Charlie Kirk), people who had no issues showing up to his memorial. I mean, really gross stuff who were attacking me. And he could have at least provided some cover. Now, I'm not saying that I need help, but sometimes it's nice to offer somebody a lifeboat when they're being attacked for telling the truth, right? So I do want to say that. Also, I'm glad that Andrew responded correctly because I was going to say this when Blake's like, "Well, you know, the investigation is ongoing." That text message has nothing to do with an investigation whatsoever. ^t-00-18-31

I've never stated that Israel killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Anybody that's been watching this investigative series—we've come up—I mean, there hasn't even been an Israeli name that's popped up in this investigation. There's only been one Jewish person, I think, that's popped up thus far in this investigation, which is George Zinn, decoy boy. So they're just saying that. They're just saying that. I just wanted to say that he was under a tremendous amount of pressure. Now, regarding the other things that are circulating that have not been publicized yet—and people should know that there is an underground movement of truth-tellers in this moment, okay? ^t-00-19-15

We just don't like the way it feels. The vibes are off. I will respect—even though obviously that statement was prepared—I will respect the fact that Andrew says what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have said. And for the first time, I feel that's been expressed: that we have to let free speech be our North Star. And I'm not so sure that the people—some of the people that are donating to Turning Point USA—believe that. In fact, I'm certain some of them don't believe that. Obviously, we wouldn't have that text message if they all believed that. ^t-00-19-58

So please, Andrew, make sure that Tyler Bowyer and Alex Clark get the internal memo about free speech. I wanna say one more thing rather explosively: Three people told me off-record—two people who have this in a written communication from Charlie (Charlie Kirk), one who is a Turning Point USA donor, and I would say very much one of the white knights in this. ^t-00-20-43

He told these people, "I think they're going to kill me," okay? He did not express that to me. So I am telling you this based off the testimony of three people. And I am saying this because I hope that these people—who I think are good—will be inspired to come forward with that. And again, those conversations I had were off-record. I honor that. If I say it's off-record, it stays off-record.

Now, to answer—to give the obvious answer—to federal informant Nick Fuentes' question: the reason that I waited to reveal the text messages is because I'm not a child. Like I said, I have a lot more. I'm not an idiot, and I have self-control, and I understand that time is always going to be on the side of truth. Time is on the side of truth. Liars? No. That's the reality.

Just a few hours before I dropped that text chain, Josh Hammer was concerning himself with what he's been doing since Charlie (Charlie Kirk) caught the bullet in his neck. He has been spreading lies, saying that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never flinched on Israel, right? Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never flinched. Oh my God, these people like Gettys—they're lying. 48 hours before, Josh Hammer was on that text thread. And that did not stop him from keeping up the propagandist effort when he went on a show yesterday—before I dropped the messages—and said this. (Clip: Josh Hammer) ^t-00-23-28

We actually spoke literally the night before his tragic and untimely death. I was on a small Zoom call with him and a couple others. We were literally talking through this topic. I was giving Charlie (Charlie Kirk) advice for how to message on this issue on his forthcoming campus tour. He kind of jokingly mentioned to me—he was like, 'Josh, I'm going to mention your book, Israel and Civilization, and it's so good.' And that was literally our last conversation. It's just so tragic. This letter that he wrote to the prime minister, Chris—I read back in June or July or so. And there were so many people in the aftermath of his horrific assassination—Candace Owens, folks like that—who were saying that, oh, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was turning on Israel. ^t-00-24-12

But this letter that he wrote to Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) Netanyahu, Chris—literally begins—the first sentence of the letter is (I'm paraphrasing here, but it's a close paraphrase), 'As a Christian, one of my greatest joys in life is making friendships with the Jewish people and defending the state of Israel.'"

In fact, I'm quite alarmed with what I know: that there are three people who said that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) communicated 24 hours before he died that he thought they were going to kill him.

Do we not guard rooftops anymore? There's been assassinations, assassination attempts all over the world. Why aren't we looking at rooftops? And then when I was sent the video at the same message where they said Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was just shot— when I watched that horrific video—he was obviously dead before he hit the ground. But the questions immediately started to come to me. That was not an entry wound that we saw. We saw an exit wound. So where'd that bullet come from? You don't bleed like—and I've shot guys closer than the camera was— an entry wound doesn't look like that. An exit wound does. Why did his shirt move the way it did? When I've shot people, their shirts didn't move like that. And then the initial reaction was, "Well, he was obviously wearing body armor, and it was deflection." ^t-00-28-35

Why were people being interviewed saying, "Yeah, they came from my left to right—from his right to left"—immediately shut down? And then did they tear the crime scene down immediately? Just right off the bat from seeing it—knowing he was dead—saying a lot of this is bad. Not even getting into the soliloquy of text messages that 22-year-olds don't send their trans lover. So immediately, the official story sounds like it needs to be investigated. But now the whole crime scene is gone. They paved over it. Nothing to see here. ^t-00-29-19

They are fantastic. The black Angus beef is famous for its great flavor. Riverbend Ranch has taken black Angus beef to a whole new level because over the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones, without antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. ^t-00-30-40

It is born in the USA, raised in the USA, processed in the USA. Their meat is aged to perfection for 21 days and shipped directly from their ranch to your home.

But I want to tell you that I maintain—I actually believe—that this was a military hit that involved foreign actors and also literal actors. I believe that that day ran something akin to JFK's assassination. I believe that therefore there were multiple decoys on the ground. I do not believe—just so I'm clear here—that the person who was walking up the stairs killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-34-55

I do not believe that the person who ran across the Losey rooftop killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I think it was another decoy. I do not believe that shot came from a Losey center at all. And obviously we all know that decoy George Zinn didn't kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And I received an interesting tip about him as well: that he's much more connected than what meets the surface. He potentially has connections to the federal government—familial connections to the federal government—and we are prodding that. It's getting interesting. ^t-00-35-37

Call it a hunch. I think it's much more likely that Lance Twigg is the one that is walking in that maroon shirt. His build is nothing like Tyler Robinson's build. Lance Twigg is thinner. And obviously I'm speculating here, but I believe Tyler Robinson was involved, and he was in fact driving around campus on that day—therefore assisting in the costume changes, likely picking up clothing. ^t-00-36-12

And what was he seen doing? As I told you: dumping clothing in the cemetery beside that Dairy Queen. So I think that is what his involvement is limited to. That was his job: to get rid of clothing. It's completely nonsense to think that a person who had never killed anyone was high on adrenaline after a kill and decided to eat Dairy Queen. That doesn't even make sense biologically speaking. There was going to be an adrenaline rush that kicks in after you kill ^t-00-36-53

It's why they are freaking out about that Dairy Queen leak because it disrupts their narrative. One of many things that disrupts their narrative. But what about Lance Twigg, right? This roommate—man, something about him. The roommate of Tyler Robinson is, I think, federally protected. I especially think that because we learned some more interesting facts about him. ^t-00-37-27

Anyways, I can tell you guys—I can break this for you—that the government—and this would implicate Governor Cox and whoever else was a part of that press conference the morning after, the 33 hours after they apprehended Tyler Robinson—the government lied when they said, "Lance—you know—I'm obviously paraphrasing here—he came in peacefully. He handed over everything." I mean, the whole depiction was like he was just so shocked that his boyfriend could do something like this, ^t-00-38-02

Well, according to his family, that's just not true. According to his family, he was raided, and he was angry about that raid. And yet he was instantly released back into their care within six hours. Isn't that something? They had no idea what was happening. They were going off of Mike—the mysterious detective Mike Mitchell's tip. They had no confession. They have Tyler Robinson walking in peacefully because he doesn't want to die. And you're telling me Lance Twigg—for whatever reason—you released him immediately back into custody? No, they lied. He was not being compliant and walking in and showing them everything. ^t-00-38-46

Now, the feds are staging this entire operation, so that would follow. And if you're trying to get a conviction, you gotta be like, "And we found this in his house: the note underneath the keyboard." So convenient—but he destroyed it. He took a picture of it, but then he destroyed it. Everybody knows if you want to destroy something so it never sees a light of day, you take a picture of it so it lives forever in the iCloud. ^t-00-39-30

Obviously illegal. They were not informed that the locks were being changed. So it gives us two options: it was either Lance, or it was the feds. I was wondering: you know, if you're Lance and you really got swept up in this and you're so shocked that Tyler Robinson did this, are you speaking to your family about that? My gosh, I imagine you want to speak to your family. No, no—it seems Lance has similarly been in an unknown location since the raid. ^t-00-40-07

I would say that suggests that he's pretty arrogant right now in this moment. He's not fearful of anything. Like I said, the sense I am getting is we are watching a play, right? The government has us completely distracted with photos of people who are not even the same person. I never for a second thought the person that was in the maroon shirt was the same as the person that was walking with the limp. It's completely foolish and ridiculous. I can also tell you something else. We received a tip—which I vetted—that on the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, you know, immediately George Zinn gets up and says, "I did it, I did it, I did it," and he kind of gets dragged. ^t-00-40-52

And he told multiple nurses and doctors that he did it because he was being paid to do it. He said he had not been paid yet, but he was going to receive payment. He didn't know from whom. That's interesting. Decoy Boy told medical staff apparently he was just singing—just telling everybody who would listen—that he did it because payment was going to be promised to him if he did do it. What does that tell us? We should definitely dig into George Zinn. ^t-00-41-37

I'm not saying they are. But yeah, why wouldn't he know? I mean, make that make sense. Why wouldn't George Zinn know where the payment was coming from? Yeah. Anyways, you guys, we are on the case. I wanted to share that with you as some other explosive things that we have found out that the feds have not shared—other people that they were questioning that they did not share—people that similarly have been told to be quiet about everything. And let's be clear: they are not asking everyone to be silent because they are seeking a conviction against Tyler Robinson. ^t-00-42-22

The feds are covering their own tracks. All right, guys. I'm gonna pivot here, and I wanna read you something. I wanna be perfectly clear that despite all appearances over the last two weeks, it has been a very difficult time for me. Obviously, normally when I'm covering a story, I'm bombastic, and I feel brave and focused because I am speaking about someone that has nothing to do with me. ^t-00-43-05

I'm going to be honest: even Donald (Donald Trump)'s non-reaction—not making any demands for truth regarding this investigation—deeply upsets me. It deeply upsets me because I know how much Charlie (Charlie Kirk) loved Donald (Donald Trump). So I was just so—I was happy. It brought literal tears to my eyes when a donor from Turning Point USA—a donor that actually then unlocked a whole ^t-00-43-38

We need to be in the UK," and he was like, "Well, I know somebody who I could maybe have set up an event. We can start Turning Point UK," and that event was when I first laid eyes on George—not when I spoke to him, but when I actually first laid eyes on him. That donor issued a public statement. And I think he will be the first of many donors that might make a public statement. And he made this statement in my favor. This was written by him and his wife—two wonderful people: John and Irina Mappin. ^t-00-44-22

Like, I read this, and I said to myself, "I couldn't have written this better myself with all the time in the world." John and Irina write: "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) built Turning Point USA on transparency, free speech, and a relentless pursuit of truth. We are witness to that. If Candace Owens had been assassinated, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have torn apart every lie and devoted every working day and night to uncovering the full truth. He would not have trusted the authorities to deliver justice. He would have demanded it from the rooftops. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would not have waited for the funeral or memorial to happen. He would have gotten to work immediately. ^t-00-45-01

Consider this: Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not sleep for several days and several nights just to ensure that JD Vance became the vice presidential nominee. And although that job was supremely important for the country and its future, it was still ultimately simply helping to secure a job promotion. Candace is working to get to the truth of who killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and why they did it. Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s execution is an assassination with potentially far-reaching political consequences for America and the world. What we have seen so far beggars belief: a crime scene apparently completely destroyed in days and plenty of evidence that simply does not add up. ^t-00-45-45

The truth, when known—and we believe it will be known—will have far-reaching international consequences. The very idea that someone could be convicted and could receive the death penalty when there remains even the slightest shadow of doubt or shred of uncertainty that they may not be guilty of that crime—and that Christian souls would tolerate that possibility—is anathema to all the teachings of Christ. ^t-00-46-26

It would go against every constitutional principle that he lived, fought, and died for. Erika is in mourning. May God bless her and her family. Please give her and her family time to grieve. Any civilized culture—Christian or otherwise—allows a grieving widow 40 days of mourning to make peace with the Lord and to respect the departed. Those people who truly love her would gladly grant her all the space she needs. We certainly do. But we are growing rather sick and ashamed of seeing people criticize Candace for doing her level best to get to the bottom of and to the truth of what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on that day. ^t-00-47-02

She has an army of truth seekers worldwide who are helping her in her search and her research. This is a truly new and modern phenomenon that has never happened before. This is not 1963, and boomers need to get used to it. In our view, the official investigation should be immediately ordered by the appropriate legal authority to proactively share everything they know with Candace and her selected team. That is, if truth and real understanding of who decided to assassinate Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and why is the sincere objective. That would go some way towards restoring public trust in the system. ^t-00-47-46

They are the actions of the highest order of patriotism. Candace's actions are service to the whole country and to the world. Beyond that, they are truly providential, divinely inspired, and metaphysical. There is a relationship between truth and all living things. There is a relationship between truth and God. Right now, Turning Point USA is at a vital moment. If we continue to witness the mistreatment and the suppression of a young woman and a mother of four young children who is doing everything she can to help get to the truth about who decided that her friend and fellow freedom fighter Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had to die, they will lose the country and the world. ^t-00-48-31

Candace's extremely valid point that hers has so far been one of the only public voices from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s closest friends questioning the absurdity of some of the communications regarding what happened and demanding clarity is well made. And frankly, that point alone is shocking to the world. We have been receiving calls from senior Republicans and from Turning Point donors who agree with her all last week, and they started up again this week. They agree with Candace, but seeing the attacks that she is experiencing, they are terrified to voice their views publicly. Is that really where we are in 2025? Few people following the matter believe the official version—the virgin version. ^t-00-49-14

That statistic alone is an awful commentary on the state of the official investigation. The world wants truth. The world—Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and those who truly loved him and knew his purposes—certainly deserve justice. But justice needs not just to be done. It needs to be seen to be done justly. I want to read that sentence again because it's very powerful: "Justice needs not just to be done. It needs to be seen to be done justly." It must be truthful. It must be fair, and it must be clean. If there are videos, show them. If there is evidence, show it. The world is not going to accept anything less. This is not about who is right or wrong or whose theory is correct. ^t-00-49-59

If the current theory for the shooter is true, then okay. If that is a lie, then we need to know. Every episode of Candace's show since Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died—her heartfelt emotional tribute to her exceptional journalism—has been incredible, and anyone who cares for the truth and who wants to know who killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk) for real should watch every episode in its sequence. The fact is that we are being told—as his friends or simply as people who had never heard of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) before his assassination—simply does not make sense to the vast majority. It feels like gaslighting. It feels like we are being lied to. It is not hard to tell the truth to the public or to present the clear facts that illustrate the truth clearly. Many extremely ethical people helped to build Turning Point and all associated groups—Turning Point Action and Turning Point Faith. ^t-00-50-43

We know many of them. Ethical people will not stand for lies or injustice—either privately or publicly. The existing and future donors who were friends of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s and those he loved deserve no less. But please spare us the absurd and evil suppression of suggesting that Candace should not be doing exactly what she is doing. She is doing no more and no less than what her friend Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have done for her. Her actions are far more reasonable and explicable than an assassin's bullet to the throat. Consider for a moment the evil of possibly allowing the conviction of a potentially innocent party with the death penalty. ^t-00-51-28

In this sense, Christianity and a leading Christian democracy are now on trial. There's a special place in eternity reserved for those who would allow such an injustice. If Turning Point and those Charlie (Charlie Kirk) left in charge—if Turning Point and those who Charlie (Charlie Kirk) left in charge failed to stay true to the principles and purposes on which Charlie (Charlie Kirk) founded it and with which he and Candace originally breathed life into it during its formative years—then Turning Point will end up like MySpace. ^t-00-52-06

I believe that God has other plans for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and for his legacy. A cover-up of the truth is not—in my view—part of God's plans. I believe that people of goodwill from all over the world will ensure that. Keep going, Candace. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is walking with you every step of the way. He loves you deeply, and you are right about your friendship with him. Never at any time through all the challenges that the political arena and life brought did he ever withdraw his friendship from you, Candace.

Many of us are relying on credit cards to cover essentials. If that debt is piling up for you, you're not alone. Americans collectively owe one trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing but hesitated because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. Well, there's good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan—a solution designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate—which means one predictable monthly payment—giving you peace of mind. The loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started with no upfront or hidden fees. Call American Financing and start saving today. ^t-00-55-38

First comment that we have is from Jennifer. Jennifer writes: "Do we know anything about the security team that was supposed to keep Charlie (Charlie Kirk) alive?" I do. I have everybody's names—the people that we couldn't identify. Jennifer continues: "So many questions. Since the MO was out there due to Trump (Donald Trump), why wasn't this taken into consideration? Were drones offered and/or declined? Did they do a drill run-through that morning?" Amir Odom—hey, what's up? Thank you. He has a great YouTube channel: Amir Odom. He writes: "Before we judge Candace for thinking that there's hidden agendas, we have to admit history has given her every reason to." Absolutely. There are. Politics is a nasty business, Amir. ^t-00-57-49

Corey Henry writes: "Give me the Kool-Aid in a juice box LMAO" regarding Ashton Forbes' cult comment. Yeah, it was totally crazy. I don't know what—I like. Yeah, maybe we're in a cult of truth. I don't know. Like, what's it called? Maybe Christianity? I mean, like... I want to tell the truth, so there's that. Sarah D. writes: "Keep going, Candace. Love from Australia." Thank you, Sarah. Steve writes: "A major victory in defending Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s true legacy. We stand with you, Candace. The truth will come out. When it does, it will shake the foundations of the world." I believe it. You believe it. We all believe it. John and Irina believe it. We feel it, you know? Like we're fighting, and it feels... There's a finality to it. ^t-00-58-31

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=3555" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:59:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-59-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Like, this had to happen, and the demons are frantic, and they're angry. And I only have a platform because I keep telling the truth, you know? If I had lied—if I had sold my soul, which many people have done—I wouldn't have earned your trust. And so, yeah, it comes at a cost. It certainly comes at a cost. The last two weeks have been very hard, but it also comes at an even more amazing reward. Justine Lowe writes: "As soon as you said he was betrayed, I knew it was true. My female intuition at work—brought me to tears and prayed for your safety." Thank you. He was. He was. RN Explorer writes: "Thank you for fighting for the truth. I believed you from the beginning. I'm crying as you read that letter." ^t-00-59-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=3599" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:59:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-00-59-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I'm glad you cried. Because I was like, "Not twice in the same year." If I'm gonna be caught crying. But yeah. "You are laying your life and fighting for the truth for your friend." Amy writes: "Most Holy Theotokos, bless and protect the handmaid of God, Candace, and her family. Candace, so many of us in the Orthodox Christian community are praying for you. Lord, have mercy on us all." Yep. ^t-00-59-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=3626" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:00:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-01-00-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You know, it has also been great to feel the Orthodox and the Catholic energy rising. And I want to be clear: I'm not saying that as a potshot to other denominations. But it feels like there's been a lot of persecution, and a lot of this for some reason has involved—as I showed you yesterday—you know, pastors that have been a part of this, like part of spreading these lies. And that is—it's not good. It's just not good to have pastors using the Bible to lie. It's just not okay. Maheen Siddiqui writes: "I think it would be interesting to do a deep dive into how the term 'Judeo-Christian' came about. I'm aware of it. It seems to be a very convenient word for Israel." I don't think any of the core values or their views on Jesus are shared. ^t-01-00-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=3669" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:01:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-01-01-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It definitively is not. You know, we inherited it. We were all in public schools. We all thought the same thing. I was working for Zionist entities. So I don't fault us our ignorance. That is how the deception is thick, you know? And we're finally piercing through that layer for the first time. Will Wallace writes: "Decoy boy, please reach out to Candace people for the tea. Gang gang is inquiring." We feel like we know, but we don't know now, right? I agree. Eldah MJ writes: "Rooting for you from Malaysia and praying for your safety. You are so brave." Thank you. Donna writes: "I'm not crying. You're crying, Candace." I know you were crying. I felt the Holy Spirit in every word that you pressed today. ^t-01-01-09

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=3712" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:01:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-01-01-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Godspeed, and may He bless you eternally for what you are doing—the potential sacrifice of your life and those around you. Yeah, I think we have to be brave. And I'm a real Christian. I know this life is not it. I know it's not it. And in fact, people I know have intentionally been trying to convince us that this is it so that they can further commit you to their matrix—to get you to agree to sell your soul, to get you to agree to lie because you're so worried about things that are in this world. I know that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s soul was removed from his body, and I know that he's watching, and I keep that in mind. When it gets hard, I keep in mind that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is watching. ^t-01-01-52

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=3752" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:02:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-01-02-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I know—I feel that he's with me, and he's proud that somebody who cared about him is fighting. Boredom Took Over writes: "You are literally my spirit animal and have given me the motivation to push forward on my dream. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is so proud of you, love. Please don't give up on us, and these fakes should be scared. You are the storm." Thank you. We are the storm because I'm telling you: I could not do it without you guys and my family, and they've just been amazing. Luna writes: "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) also told Dr. Frank Turk right before his death—when they were having a convo about upping his security—that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) knows—quote-unquote—'they want him dead.' Frank shared this on his podcast following Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s death." That makes four. Yeah, he knew. He knew he was going to be killed. Who did he think was going to kill him? That's the question. ^t-01-02-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5autG89PW6w&t=3796" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:03:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-5autG89PW6w/t-01-03-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I'm glad to hear that Frank Turk shared that. Linda writes: "Girl, you made me cry. God bless you. I'm praying for you. Ave Maria." Thank you. John and Irina made me cry, so it's really their fault. If you want to be angry at anybody, you can be angry at John and Irina for writing that. I did. I felt the Holy Spirit in those words. I really did. It's how we're all feeling. Turtle Mama writes: "I enjoy listening to your content, and I feel so at peace with the information that you share as truth. Sending prayers for Mississippi and stay safe." Thank you so much, Turtle Mama. We're all actually doing this thing. So thank you guys for supporting me on this journey. Thank you for all of you guys that have signed up at CandaceOwens.com, bought yourself a hat, a t-shirt, joined our CIA—the decentralized—which is more of a threat, by the way. If it's centralized, you can just whack it. ^t-01-03-16

And that's why I sent out that little packet to people that I trust, and I sent screenshots to Max. I'm like, "Everyone who is threatening me behind the scenes— all that stuff, using lawfare to threaten me or free speech—like we're now all attached," okay? So there we go. I recommend that everybody does that. Send it to people on the left. Send it to people on the right. I love that people on the left and right are finally coming together. Can I say that as well? Gosh, we are over time for the book club. Hopefully people are on this, so they know why we're late to the book club—which we have tonight as we begin this introduction to this book, which they will not reprint. What is a must-read? ^t-01-04-00

So anyways, you guys, I'll see you over on CandaceOwens.com. ^t-01-04-43
