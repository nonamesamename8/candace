**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. Happy Monday. Erika Kirk (Charlie Kirk's wife), man. That—she really is just the moment. The speech that she gave—everybody was just wowed by her. I felt my energy personally, like last night going into that. I was effectively like soaring in the air above the convention center, like a dragon above, waiting for Erika to just be like, "And I was just gonna come down and swoop in out of nowhere." All the politicians, all the fake people—everyone was just gonna be in that moment toast. But she didn't call for war. Erika did not call for war. In fact, she did the exact opposite, which is what was so stunning. It was unbelievable. The forgiveness that she granted, the strength that it took for her to call for that forgiveness— ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=44" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-00-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** it was unmatched, and it really made a difference. And I was being serious when I tweeted that. I think it was— the most consequential speech in American history, a message that everyone needed to hear, including myself—a message of complete submission to Christ. And by the way, later on, we're also going to discuss another kind of submission to Christ, which is submitting yourself to truth. Kash Patel (Kash Patel) has now come out and issued a statement fully capitulating to the public—the public insistence that they're lying to us. They are so clearly lying to us about what happened on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) lost his life. Nothing they've told us thus far makes any sense, and somehow it's only getting worse. So welcome back. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=86" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-01-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Let's jump right into this. I have to say, any woman that can get on stage and meaningfully say that they forgive the person who killed their husband that quickly— you are truly a better person than me, because I've just been so angry, so angry. And yet she was able to, through tears—and obviously you could tell how difficult that moment was for her— but she arrived at forgiveness, and she did it in front of the entire world. ^t-00-01-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=130" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-02-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I think that every single person should watch that speech. Truly, they should watch that speech. They should watch Tucker Carlson's (Tucker Carlson) speech. I don't think even showing you clips of it—I'm gonna show you one—could do it justice. You should watch it in its entirety. The emotion, the message of it. And you can obviously see why Charlie (Charlie Kirk) fell in love with her. I remember meeting Erika. We were at... Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I were in New York for something or another, and he was falling for her hard, but he wanted to play it cool. He wanted to play it cool, so he's like, "Come meet her at Del Frisco's in New York City." And I came there, and she was just lovely. She was genuinely such a nice person. I was like, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk), just go for it." Just go for it. And he did go for it. And last night, I really do think that the entire world needed to hear her message. ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=173" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-02-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** What you took from it, how you could apply it to your life— is up to you. But specifically, the part that she shared that provided me with so much peace—and I needed to hear it, truly—was when she explained that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not suffer. Because that—thinking about that is... I just—I really shed so many tears over it, just thinking that he suffered even for a moment. It was my favorite part of her speech, so I'm gonna play that right now. (Erika Kirk clip) ^t-00-02-53

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=202" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-03-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** One moment Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was doing what he loved: arguing and debating on campus, fighting for the gospel and truth in front of a big crowd. And then he blinked. He blinked and saw his Savior in paradise. And all the heavenly mysteries were revealed to him. ^t-00-03-22

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=244" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-04-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I mean, that—it's just beautiful. And to really think about that—that he just blinked and then he was with the Lord. And it is just a fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) just loved the Lord. It was constantly, like I told you, going through the conversations and how much he would just say, "I need to pray about it. I need to pray about it. I need to pray about it," wanting to marry Erika. First thing he said—which I think I showed you guys last week—and Erika is correct. It is important to remember that message of forgiveness that we have within ourselves. And it sometimes feels very hard to do that, but we are called upon to forgive people, to forgive our enemies—even in moments that it seems impossible or extraordinary to do so. ^t-00-04-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=281" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-04-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But it is also important—it's not really a "but," but I want to assert that it is also important to remember that what Christ is, as I said at the top of this show— is truth, right? Christ is truth. And we are not getting the truth right now of what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on 9-10. And to be very clear, I am going to need it. I demand it. In fact, I'm now currently working on a minute-by-minute timeline, which I will have for you guys later this week, of what exactly happened in the seconds and minutes following Charlie (Charlie Kirk) getting shot. I need to know. I need to follow bodies. I've already been able to, as I asked over the weekend, locate George Zinn in the crowd. ^t-00-04-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=325" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-05-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It seems a bit suspicious to me how far he was and then suddenly they take him through a pathway. I mean, that's him right there. Thank you to the person that sent this picture. But then I find him on video, and I'm trying to understand how he made it down the pathway and was taken through to the same area that they had just taken Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in the car. I have a lot of questions, and each and every one of them will be answered by the end of this investigation. And I also want to put it to you this way: so much more has come to light that I have not yet presented. I am working with other journalists—different aspects—asking them, "Hey, you look into this. I'm going to look into that." ^t-00-05-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=365" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-06-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And the first thing that I think I should make abundantly clear is I am relieved that Erika Kirk is at the head of Turning Point USA, because just like I alluded to last week—and which I will double down on now—I believe that people within that company betrayed Charlie (Charlie Kirk), okay? That's just what I believe right now. And I want to make sure that I have these facts entirely on my side before I tell you guys more. I will say, if you are a rat on a ship, you should probably flee now. I recommend it. Anyways, you guys, on Friday we did an episode. ^t-00-06-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=407" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-06-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I wanna be clear: I didn't think that that episode was going to have the reaction that it did, but I am grateful. We were unpacking the footage that was going viral of the guy that was taking down the camera—which was directly behind Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) head—a mere four minutes after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot. Everybody thought that it was very suspicious. I recognized the individual and reached out, had a conversation, saw the footage, and made the promise that I was not going to share it—although I said to you, I encouraged them to share it. I believe that the reason everybody is a conspiracy theorist is because people don't share truth, right? Once you share everything, there's no room for conspiracy. ^t-00-06-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=449" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-07-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And when I was sharing what I saw, I was doing so because I was just thinking that, you know, this could help. Like, this can obviously remove people from their conspiracies. And then it kind of occurred to me that what I shared was a bigger deal than I had imagined—by saying that I didn't see any blood. And that is a fact. I did not see any blood. In fact, the only blood that I did see at all—I'm talking about blood on the back—was on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) hand, on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) left hand, which—as many people have been saying—means that the blood moved forward. We don't need to get into all of the gore. ^t-00-07-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=487" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-08-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But what I didn't expect thereafter was for the Turning Point USA spokesperson, Andrew Coltvet, to issue this statement as people were asking questions like, "Hey, how is that possible? How was there nothing in the back if this is the gun that was used?" Andrew Coltvet tweeted this over the weekend. (Andrew Coltvet tweet) "I want to address some of the discussion about the lack of an exit wound with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I'm usually not interested in delving into most of this kind of online chatter, and I apologize that this is somewhat graphic. But in this case, the fact that there wasn't an exit wound is probably another miracle, and I want people to know. I just spoke with the surgeon who worked on Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in the hospital. ^t-00-08-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=530" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-08-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He said the bullet, quote, 'absolutely should have gone through,' which is very, very normal for a high-powered, high-velocity round. 'I've seen wounds from this caliber many times, and they always just go through everything. This would have taken a moose or two down, an elk, et cetera,' end quote. And then now this is Andrew: 'But it didn't go through. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) body stopped it. I mentioned to his doctor that there were dozens of staff, students, and special guests standing directly behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on the other side of the tent, and he replied, "It was an absolute miracle that someone else didn't get killed." ^t-00-08-50

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=569" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-09-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** His bone—referring to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—was so healthy and the density was so, so impressive that he's like the Man of Steel. It should have just gone through and through. It likely would have killed those standing behind him too. In the end, the coroner did find the bullet just beneath the skin. Even in death, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) managed to save the lives of those around him. Remarkable and miraculous." End statement. Now, first I want to say this, because people were attacking Andrew Coltvet immediately: I want to say that it is good to remember that this is Andrew Coltvet's literal job. ^t-00-09-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=606" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-10-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, he is a PR agent. He runs a PR company, and his job is to respond to online chatter and online questions. And sometimes it may not even be what you want to say. In fact, it should never actually—if you're doing your job—be necessarily what you want to say. He also was very close to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So I would imagine that he's under a tremendous amount of pressure. The company is moving in a different direction. These are—we are still just over a week after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) lost his life—and he has to be the messenger. Who is directing that message? We don't know, but his job can't be easy at this moment, okay? If I say to my PR agent, "I want you to make this statement," he works for the company. ^t-00-10-06

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=650" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-10-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** My PR person just has to make a statement, okay? So I think I would like to just respond to what is being said objectively, rather than to attack Andrew Coltvet's character. That aside, the statement objectively feels to me like the manipulation of a Christian audience, right? They know Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) audience is Christian. And therefore what they're selling to us is: "We—you should believe. You're a believer, right? As a Christian, you believe in miracles, right? Like, you believe in Christ and the miracles that Jesus performed, right? Well, then you should just believe this." There's something about that that I don't like. I don't like that. ^t-00-10-50

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=695" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-11-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I don't like just, "This was a miracle, and that should just be the end, and no more questions should be asked." Yes, the conservative base is filled with Christians, but also the conservative base is filled with a lot of hunters, okay? People that hunt, and they know weapons, and they know how weapons work, and they know how weapons don't work. And this particular statement to me does not pass the sniff test. Now, again, when I shared that information, I had assumed they were going to say the angle went through this way. I did not imagine they were just going to say that it was a miracle. Alex Jones—he immediately took to X live. This began trending. ^t-00-11-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=736" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-12-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The statement began trending, and he jumped onto X, and he responded to that statement, saying this. Take a listen. (Alex Jones clip) ^t-00-12-16

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=746" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-12-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** The spokesperson for TPUSA just posted two hours ago that they talked to the coroner and that Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was shot with .30-06 in the left side of his neck and that he's a man of steel and that the bones in his neck that are like chicken bones stopped a bullet that travels 2,500 feet a second out of the barrel—at 200 yards, depending on the grain of the cartridge and the rest of it. Probably hit him at 1,900 feet per second. ^t-00-12-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=788" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:08</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-13-08.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** I've shot hogs at 500 yards—.30-06, right to the side. Tiny hole, blows a four-inch hole out to the side. We're talking two feet of a hog. Boom. Hit him in the head—brain completely blows up. They just said he got shot with a .30-06 and that it didn't go through. Yeah, it's a lot. ^t-00-13-08

And here's the thing: if you were going to bring me to the argument that this truly was a miracle, it probably would not be in the midst of a circumstance where the feds are lying. That is like, "Not now," right? Because it could be a miracle also ^t-00-13-34

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=835" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-13-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** that Tyler Robinson decided to take a break at Dairy Queen and issue some texts that sound like they were written in 1822 and tell every single... It could just be a miracle, right—for the feds—and go through every single detail of exactly how he planned it, why he planned it, including his MAGA dad—who's been extra MAGA lately, that he doesn't actually live with, and nobody knows why the dad is extra MAGA lately— and explaining where to find the weapon. And just a miracle that he happened to leave this letter that has since been disappeared—but they, you know, he took a picture; his lover took a picture of it. It could just all be one big federal miracle. ^t-00-13-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=878" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-14-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But I'm not inclined to believe that at this moment, okay? I'm not inclined to believe any of this at this moment, and so we press on, okay? And because Alex and many other people—and hunters and conservatives—were going, "Yeah, no." I mean, people were even posting videos of them shooting to show what that damage would be like. Kash Patel (Kash Patel) then made an extraordinary move. And I would say I would refer to this as a capitulation to online sleuths. He tweeted this. (Kash Patel tweet) ^t-00-14-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=913" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-15-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "Here, as the Director of the FBI, I am committed to ensuring the investigation into Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination is thorough and exhaustive, pursuing every lead to its conclusion. The full weight of America's law enforcement agencies are actively following the evidence that has emerged, but our efforts extend beyond initial findings. We are examining every facet of this assassination. We are meticulously investigating theories and questions, including the location from where the shot was taken, the possibility of accomplices, the text message confession and related conversations, Discord chats, the angle of the shot and bullet impact, ^t-00-15-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=954" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-15-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** how the weapon was transported, hand gestures observed as potential signals near Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at the time of his assassination, and visitors to the alleged shooter's residence in the hours and the days leading up to September 10, 2025. Some details are known today, while others are still being pursued to ensure every possibility is considered. Our primary focus is to complete this investigation and deliver justice. To protect the integrity of the investigation and subsequent prosecution, we cannot release every piece of information that we have to the public right now. ^t-00-15-54

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=986" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-16-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We will ensure every question is addressed at the appropriate moment regarding specific details, such as questions about the plane that allegedly turned off its transponder after departing from an airport near the assassination site. We can share updates when answers are confirmed. After interviews with the pilot, in consultation with the FAA, we determined the transponder was not turned off. Incomplete flight data in rural areas caused the apparent gap. The entire FBI mourns the loss of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). We will not rest until justice is served, and our investigation into this assassination will continue until every question is answered." Okay, so first thing that I can very quickly debunk is when he says that they looked into the transponder thing ^t-00-16-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1029" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-17-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** and, yeah, we checked it out, and actually they just lost service. Okay. That disputes what the plane owner themselves—he identified himself, Derek Maxfield—and issued a long statement on Instagram where he said that they got permission to—you know—turn off services, which are transponder services, and they got that permission from the air traffic controller. So it can't be both. It can't be, "No, it never happened; they just lost service," and Derek Maxfield saying, "No, we had communication with the ATC—which is air traffic control—and what we did followed guidelines." So that's already a problem. Secondly, ^t-00-17-09

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1072" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-17-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** saying that you're not going to release information because you want to protect the integrity of the investigation while also releasing those ridiculous text messages that looked like somebody was having fun on TikTok and making, you know, a ridiculous skit— I don't feel like the investigation has much integrity, or the feds in general have any integrity, after you guys gaslit us about Jeffrey Epstein. So if you want us to restore credibility to the feds, I would allow the mommy sleuths to take over. That's my opinion. I'd get in touch and allow the internet to do what the internet does, because now you're answering everything that we brought up. ^t-00-17-52

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1116" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-18-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Not me—we—because it is because of the entire world paying attention, sending tips. I'm grateful to God that I have a platform to be able to share that information and to encourage it. But this is just coming from regular people around the world. And now you guys are—it feels like—playing defense because you have not been playing offense. So yeah, that would be my free advice. That's not going to be listened to. While I have your attention, I do have a few more questions that could be answered—or maybe some leads that you guys could be exploring—if you will. Because once we began learning about that house next door that's been vacant and is owned by UVU, ^t-00-18-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1159" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-19-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** and once we began looking into the witnesses and finding a common last name and looking into Caldera Engineering as we did last week—again, not implying that they did anything wrong, just telling you factually that that witness whose footage ended up in the hands of TMZ runs an engineering company that has a presence worldwide, and they specialize in making these valves— ^t-00-19-19

Because if you just want to shut down someone's pipeline—let's say you want to shut off water or you want to shut off gasoline—yeah, it makes sense why the government would want to be controlling pipelines and valves. But anyways, I started to ask myself: oh, well, did anybody look into whether or not there was anything under Charlie (Charlie Kirk) when he was shot, right? ^t-00-19-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1223" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:20:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-20-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Because if we aren't accepting the narrative that that particular gun at that distance didn't pass through, and yet for whatever reason the feds scrambled to repave that area—maybe, as some people have speculated, he was shot from a closer distance— I started wondering: was there an access point to any valves? Were there any pipelines that could have been under Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? And as it turns out, I looked at some old pictures of where he was sitting, and there was a massive pipeline that was almost exactly behind where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was sitting. Here's that. Maybe it's a water pipeline. I don't know, but there it is under the flag. ^t-00-20-23

They're like, "Hey, yeah, there's like a whole underground thing there." And to your right, you're observing those two little boxes, and they told me that that was a trap door. Now, I'm not implying someone popped up and shot Charlie (Charlie Kirk), but that's a close-up of that area. I'm just implying that there's an entire underground there. And I remember when I looked at the footage; I felt like it was coming up. I don't know anything about ballistics. I'm not an expert. But if there was a hatch door nearby, then we can assume—as we should always assume with colleges, obviously stadiums—there's always an underground path. ^t-00-21-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1308" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:21:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-21-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So I'm wondering if the federal government has explored the possibility that somebody could have been under Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and done that. While everyone's looking around and thinking that a shot went off from here, if that was just maybe like decoy number two and actually Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot from beneath him—which then could maybe explain why there was no exit wound. Again, I'm theorizing because I have a right to. I have a right to think. And that is interesting to me. Where does it go? Where do the tunnels underneath UVU lead to, right? That's an interesting question. Maybe everyone's looking up when we should be looking below, right? ^t-00-21-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1350" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:22:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-22-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Maybe we should be looking below if there is this interest in pipelines. And I saw that actually where he was sitting, there's a whole irrigation system that's managed by the university. And so there's definitively stuff beneath Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Again, I don't know anything about ballistics, but I've been very clear that we will be exploring every lead until we get a proper answer for what happened. And I think that that would probably be an interesting one for the feds to explore, because within 48 hours—I mean, was it 48 hours, Skyler?— they decided to instead pave that area—repave it. Do we have footage of that? Here we go. Yeah, no, they kind of did the opposite here. ^t-00-22-30

And I feel like that was a little soon. So I don't know if things can be unpaved—I'm sure they can—but maybe exploring a tunnel network would be a good start. And I will leave it at that before we get into the absurd. I didn't think it could be more absurd than last week in the matters that I have been attacked. But over the weekend, somebody reported me to the FBI and the CIA. And I'm not going to prison alone. I'm taking all of you guys first. Let me tell you guys about PreBorn, because I've watched too many people who I'm close to be vilified for standing up for truth.

I don't want to water down what I believe in to be palatable. Not that I've ever been accused of doing that. But it is true that silence is not kindness. Silence is consent. And right now, the greatest silence that is being had right now is around the lives that are ended before they even take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we should act like it. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For just $28, you can provide a free ultrasound to a woman that is in a crisis and considering an abortion. $28 will help her see the life inside of her, to give her the truth that we know that our current culture will not.

I mean, last week was insane. I got to the point where I just went—I just shrugged. I just Kanye shrugged. I'm like, "Okay." I don't know what to say. But this was just so funny. I had to share it. I have been meaningfully reported to the FBI and the CIA. And I want to be very clear: you guys are all complicit. Just this weekend—this is real. A real live tweet came from Laura Loomer, our resident psycho. ^t-00-26-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1618" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:26:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-26-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** She tweeted this. (Laura Loomer tweet) She's been attacking me nonstop. "As part of her grift to monetize the murder of her quote-unquote best friend, Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), Candace Owens (Candace Owens) is selling a CIA line of merchandise that is called the Candace Intelligence Agency, which rips off the CIA name and logo. It is a federal felony to use the CIA seal without license." She then cites the code and reads it—sends a quote from it, rather—pulls it, and then says, "You are likely breaking the law with your CIA merch, Candace (Candace Owens). The CIA can technically sue to get Candace (Candace Owens) to stop using their logo. It's really disrespectful to Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) and the CIA." ^t-00-26-58

Now, as everybody who watches this show knows, we've been selling that merch since before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got assassinated. So we just continued our show with the merch that we already sold for our show. Obviously, our parody off of the CIA—which is perfectly legal, obviously—was related to the fact that we're always investigating things. So don't let the truth get in your way when you're smearing somebody. But the audacity to actually tag the Director of the CIA and ask us to go to prison or to get into trouble is just—I think it really highlights: they're insane. ^t-00-27-37

It is reaching new levels. I love the guy who then tweeted under her. This was so good. He just said, "Look at Amazon committing all of these quote-unquote federal felonies." And then he says, "F Israel-first Laura Loomer," as just a little side note. And then he shows all the T-shirts on Amazon because—like, obviously you can buy yourself an FBI costume for Halloween if you'd like to. But that wasn't enough, because last week was that insane. Like, they just tried to wipe away years of my life by pretending—completely fictionalized— that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I had a breakup, right? Eric Bolling did this. He said—I even... I don't know if he was even sober on that program because he said he hadn't seen me— ^t-00-28-21

He interviewed me in 2020. So that was weird. But they were clearly—the call went out to just make up something that never happened. Never happened. I never had a falling out with Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). And so this guy—Awesome Jew, who I heard was also in the Hamptons with Bill Ackman and that group of people who went out there—he then tries to cleverly release a text message between Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) and an unknown individual. The text message has no date; it has no time. And I'm going to tell you why that is, and I'm going to tell you exactly when that text message had to have occurred. But him releasing this tweet spectacularly backfired. ^t-00-29-05

Look at this message. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) talking trash about Candace (Candace Owens)—except he's not at all. Instead, what the message did is that it proved exactly what I was saying: that donors and Zionists were attempting to control his speech, my speech, and who he platformed. So these are the text messages that he shared. And he wrote: "Exclusive: a close friend of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) shared these messages." I'm going to guess it's either Seth Dillon or Josh Hammer. Could not be, but I'm just putting that out there because of the style of the messages. And he says he was never wavering on Israel, and they are active— he was actively pushing back on Candace Owens's (Candace Owens's) false narrative. Now, these are the messages he shared. (Text messages) ^t-00-29-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1833" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:30:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-30-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** This is the friend of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in blue. He writes: "I watched the podcasts. Candace (Candace Owens) needs to say two things, and this will stop in its tracks. They are fundamental conservative principles. And she didn't say either: quote, 'Israel is not committing a genocide.' Second quote: '30 dead, raped, kidnapped, and beheaded Americans in Gaza makes the fight in Gaza America First.' And then he ends it by saying: 'This is not Ukraine.'" He's literally saying what I have to say to make something stop in its tracks, right? And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) writes: "This is right. I'm really trying to help her." What else is he going to say to this person? ^t-00-30-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=1874" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:31:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-31-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And then—but it's that second message that I can tell you exactly what the context was, because I was messaging Charlie (Charlie Kirk) about it. And I can tell you the timeframe and why they wiped it: because it's from 2023. He then writes: "It doesn't come natural to her because I truly think she doesn't understand saying that Muslims are forced to live in a Muslim quarter in Israel." And that betrays the timeline. Okay. So what clearly happened in this text chain is that I tweeted—this is when it all started for me, and I started getting threats that I had to take it back if I wanted my life back—and he's kind of saying that there, right? "This will all stop." I tweeted that genocide is always wrong. Here's the exact tweet. (Candace Owens tweet) "No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever. ^t-00-31-14

I can't believe this even needs to be said or is even considered the least bit controversial to state." That tweet was me responding to something that Brian Mast said in Congress. He said, "There's no such thing as an innocent Palestinian life." That was grotesque. So I then started getting peer-pressured to correct the tweets, to apologize for the tweet—at the time I was at The Daily Wire—that I needed to understand why my tweet was wrong. Dave Rubin instantly replied and said something about Israel—even though I didn't mention Israel in the tweet. And by itself, it was... I still stand by that tweet, guys, years on. And I was being inundated. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was being inundated. Like, "How could she say this? How dare she say this thing? ^t-00-31-57

And then I hosted somebody who was a Zionist on my show, and that's what he's referring to: the conversation that I had with Ami Kozak. And clearly Charlie (Charlie Kirk) probably said to him, "You can watch this to get her viewpoints." "Candace (Candace Owens) is not anti-Semitic." And that guy is not having it. He is incensed, and he is saying, "Here are the words that we have to hear from Candace (Candace Owens)." The reason they stripped that and didn't put the date—that it was 2023—is because it destroys the narrative that they're trying to put out: that me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had a falling out. Because obviously I went on tour with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at the beginning of 2024, and I spoke at their conference in the summer of 2024. ^t-00-32-41

Rather, what happened was Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was peer-pressured by these same individuals for me not to speak at AmFest, and I was just like, "Dude, I don't even care"—which is what I told you. Now, in terms of his statement there that Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) viewpoints were not changing at all—these are not words that I put in Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) mouth. You can just go back and watch the things that he was saying. He hosted a sit-down—which was incredible, actually—to discuss what anti-Semitism is and what anti-Semitism is not. It was a town hall of sorts with students. Gen Z—as Megyn Kelly (Megyn Kelly) said—you can't find anybody beneath the age of 30 that supports Israel. That's a fact. ^t-00-33-19

People are tired of it. We're tired of being bullied. For me, they behaved like a mafia. There's no other way to say it. My livelihood was being threatened. And then eventually—obviously—I lost my job. Behind the scenes, telling me what I had to say if I wanted to—I don't know—still be welcomed into the circle. And I made a conscious decision to not be welcomed. I don't wanna be around people that are behaving like that—that are speaking like the way that person is speaking. "Here's what she needs to say." Who are you? I don't need to say anything. My statement was fine. Genocide is always wrong, okay? It's just always wrong. ^t-00-34-04

They wanted me to apologize. I was being told I needed to issue a public statement to apologize for the tweet that I just read to you. Genocide is always wrong. Wackadoodle. Anyways, let's hear Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) in his own words. This is from July of this year. He was hosting a town hall about anti-Semitism. Skyler, let's first run the clip of—just before we get into the AIPAC clip—just him discussing with Gen Z anti-Semitism. Take a listen. (Charlie Kirk clip) ^t-00-34-47

He was doing the thing that the people in charge hate most, which is calling for them to repent. So how is Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) message different? And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a political person who was deeply interested in coalition building and in getting the right people in office because he knew that vast improvements are possible politically.

Politics, at its core, is a process of critiquing other people and getting them to change. Christianity—the gospel message, the message of Jesus—begins with repentance.

First, I wanna tell you guys about Nimi Skincare, because I know a lot of you guys ask me what I use to keep my skin looking healthy and glowing. And the answer is simple. It is Nimi Skincare. It's a part of my daily routine—also my nightly routine. If your skin is starting to show signs of aging—like fine lines creeping in, your skin is starting to sag a bit, or it's tired or uneven, or you feel like you're just kind of losing that youthful glow—then you should definitely try Nimi's anti-aging skincare line. Their products have worked wonders on me. Nimi's three-step anti-aging routine is packed with powerful, clinically-backed ingredients that work. ^t-00-45-51

If that debt is piling up, then you are not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing, but maybe hesitated to do so because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. There's good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC—which can have varied interest rates—the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment, giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes a 10-minute phone call to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now. ^t-00-47-20

"Also, the children that spoke yesterday sounded highly rehearsed on their quote-unquote experience." Okay, so to the first portion: I can tell you that I know Jack Posobiec. He has always been very solid with me. I mean, always. And Jack Posobiec—by the way—every single time that I have been attacked publicly, particularly over the declaration that Christ is King, it's like a trigger for Jack Posobiec. He goes hard in the paint. If you say you can't say "Christ is King," Jack Posobiec wants to go to war immediately—him and his brother. And that's great. So he's like a crusader. ^t-00-48-44

So I do know that he was a naval intelligence officer. He's never denied that. And if he is an intelligence officer that is still active, then I got to tell you—he's good. I like Jack. I like Jack. And I can only tell you my experience with people. If I uncover something about him, then I'm going to come for his whole life. But I like Jack.

I will say this: I would argue that in terms of the free markets, like, you go with your product: "You say, 'I'm pro-Israel. I'm running this business.'" They are losing—badly, badly. There's no question about that. Everyone can see it everywhere. And it's because of how they behave, right? The gaslighting, the threats, the intimidation. "We can control your life. We can call, and we'll create a firestorm so you won't be able to hit the stage at AmFest." People can see that, and they don't like that behavior. So when you do that—and then also say that you're the good guys— it doesn't ring true. ^t-00-50-57

And the fact that people immediately thought that—and I wasn't the person who said this—but immediately thought that Israel was suspicious really shows you that they have lost all goodwill with the American people. And that's—again—because of what they're doing: their actions in Gaza. So I would agree with you that they've lost a lot since losing Charlie (Charlie Kirk), because he was kind of the last person who said, "I am pro-Israel." And he actually was somebody who had a presence across all of these universities. ^t-00-51-39

There's probably some radar you can buy to see where the tunnels are. You're just a student on the campus. If it's legal—obviously. I have no idea if it's legal. Do not do anything illegal.

My dad was a plumber, and I know that there's got to be a whole network under there if they're supporting a waterfall in that amphitheater style. It's like a whole thing.

This person writes: "The internet is back in Palestine, and people are speaking out." Yep. And I have been somebody that has spoken out, and it came at great risk. And I am very happy that I did. I have no regrets. I was happy to be canceled from anything to say what I felt in my heart to be true. And that is also the lesson of the story of Christ. You know—you have to tell the truth.

If that wasn't relevant, Andrew wouldn't have said it. What does it mean?" I think she knows everything. She's his wife. What is a wife? Everything she said on stage yesterday: a confidant—every secret that the world is not meant to know about Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). She knows about Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). Who was stressing him out? Why did you lay your head next to your wife or your husband? My husband knows everything there is to know about me. And so, yeah—there's no question that she knows everything. I saw people that were going: "Erika Kirk is going on—I think—Alex Clark's show." And they were tweeting it at me. I think it was Laura Loomer. She's totally wacky. "Oh, you'll see." See what? I don't lie for this reason, okay? ^t-00-57-12

I didn't say 150 million was offered because I don't know the exact amount Benjamin Netanyahu offered him. I said 150 million dollars I was told Benjamin Netanyahu gave for Operation Mockingpastor. Remember when all the pastors one weekend got up on stage and were like, "Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) and Candace Owens (Candace Owens)?" That is what I was told. That was 150 million dollars went into that. But I definitively made the statement that Benjamin Netanyahu offered Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) a boatload of money, and he rejected it. So she will respond to that. I said that Catholics were excited—hopeful about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-57-53

Like, we are Christians—we should be— no matter what—defending one another. He obviously didn't convert, but also the nastiness towards Catholics just needs to stop—point blank. I mean, Erika Kirk was raised in a Catholic family, so that was a strange thing to have people react so crazy. I don't lie because I always know that eventually daylight comes in, and things get exposed. And so I'm excited to hear her speak about the pressure that he was under—as was alluded to by Alex Clark—to speak about whether or not he was offered more money—whether he lost money, which he did. ^t-00-58-36

I mean, there was more than just him—obviously—but he was getting pressure from donors. I mean, I think he said it on a show. So, yeah—daylight is always the best disinfectant. Anyways, you guys—thank you for all the support. We're going to have an incredible week. More stuff to reveal to you. If you want to support the show, if you want to go to prison—you can go to CandaceOwens.com and buy a CIA parody shirt—because you're going with me. I'm not going alone. I'll do it. I'll do hood rat stuff. I want to do it with my friends. So if you buy it, then I'm going to report you to Laura Loomer—who will report you to the CIA. ^t-00-59-15
