Happy Monday. <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s wife), man. That—she really is just the moment. The speech that she gave—everybody was just wowed by her. I felt my energy personally, like last night going into that. I was effectively like soaring in the air above the convention center, like a dragon above, waiting for <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> to just be like, "And I was just gonna come down and swoop in out of nowhere." All the politicians, all the fake people—everyone was just gonna be in that moment toast. But she didn't call for war. <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> did not call for war. In fact, she did the exact opposite, which is what was so stunning. It was unbelievable. The forgiveness that she granted, the strength that it took for her to call for that forgiveness<span id="event-event-2025-09-12-assassination-site-area-repaved-within-48-hours-of-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-12-assassination-site-area-repaved-within-48-hours-of.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>— ^t-00-00-00

And I was being serious when I tweeted that. I think it was— the most consequential speech in American history, a message that everyone needed to hear, including myself—a message of complete submission to Christ. And by the way, later on, we're also going to discuss another kind of submission to Christ, which is submitting yourself to<span id="event-event-2025-09-22-kash-patel-issues-fbi-statement-on-thorough-kirk-a-t-00-00-44"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-22-kash-patel-issues-fbi-statement-on-thorough-kirk-a.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> truth. <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash Patel</a></span> has now come out and issued a statement fully capitulating to the public, the public insistence that they're lying to us.

Nothing they've told us thus far makes any sense, and somehow it's only getting worse. So welcome back. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-01-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=86" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Let's jump right into this. I have to say, any woman that can get on stage and meaningfully say that they forgive the person who killed their husband that quickly— you are truly a better person than me, because I've just been so angry, so angry. And yet she was able to, through tears—and obviously you could tell how difficult that moment was for her— but she arrived at forgiveness, and she did it in front of the entire world. ^t-00-01-26

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-02-10.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=130" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I think that every single person should watch that speech. Truly, they should watch that speech. They should watch <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a>'<span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">s</a></span> speech. I don't think even showing you clips of it—I'm gonna show you one—could do it justice. You should watch it in its entirety. The emotion, the message of it. And you can obviously see why <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> fell in love with her. I remember meeting Erika. We were at... <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and I were in <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york.md">New York</a></span> for something or another, and he was falling for her hard, but he wanted to play it cool. He wanted to play it cool, so he's like, "Come meet her at Del Frisco's in <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-city-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york-city.md">New York City</a></span>." And I came there, and she was just lovely. She was genuinely such a nice person. I was like, "<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, just go for it." Just go for it. And he did go for it. And last night, I really do think that the entire world needed to hear her message. ^t-00-02-10

But specifically, the part that she shared that provided me with so much peace—and I needed to hear it, truly—was when she explained that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-53"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> did not suffer. Because that—thinking about that is... I just—I really shed so many tears over it, just thinking that he suffered even for a moment. It was my favorite part of her speech, so I'm gonna play that right now. (<span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-02-53"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> clip) ^t-00-02-53

And then he blinked. He blinked and saw his Savior in paradise. And all the heavenly mysteries were revealed to him. ^t-00-03-22

And to really think about that—that he just blinked and then he was with the Lord. <span id="claim-claim-04f508351dcf-t-00-04-04">And it is just a fact that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-04"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> just loved the Lord.<a href="/claims/claim-04f508351dcf.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> It was constantly, like I told you, going through the conversations and how much he would just say, "I need to pray about it. I need to pray about it. I need to pray about it," wanting to marry Erika. First thing he said—which I think I showed you guys last week—and Erika is correct. It is important to remember that message of forgiveness that we have within ourselves. And it sometimes feels very hard to do that, but we are called upon to forgive people, to forgive our enemies—even in moments that it seems impossible or extraordinary to do so. ^t-00-04-04

Christ is truth. And we are not getting the truth right now of what happened to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-41"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> on 9-10. And to be very clear, I am going to need it. I demand it. <span id="claim-claim-1ddc27edef1c-t-00-04-41">In fact, I'm now currently working on a minute-by-minute timeline, which I will have for you guys later this week, of what exactly happened in the seconds and minutes following <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> getting shot.<a href="/claims/claim-1ddc27edef1c.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> I need to know.

I mean, that's him right there. Thank you to the person that sent this picture. But then I find him on video, and I'm trying to understand how he made it down the pathway and was taken through to the same area that they had just taken <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-25"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> in the car. I have a lot of questions, and each and every one of them will be answered by the end of this investigation. And I also want to put it to you this way: so much more has come to light that I have not yet presented. I am working with other journalists—different aspects—asking them, "Hey, you look into this. I'm going to look into that.<span id="claim-claim-bd31cc6e8f71-t-00-05-25">"<a href="/claims/claim-bd31cc6e8f71.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> ^t-00-05-25

That's just what I believe right now. And I want to make sure that I have these facts entirely on my side before I tell you guys more. I will say, if you are a rat on a ship, you should probably flee now. I recommend it. Anyways, you guys, on Friday we did an episode. ^t-00-06-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-06-47.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:47</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=407" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I wanna be clear: I didn't think that that episode was going to have the reaction that it did, but I am grateful. We were unpacking the footage that was going viral of the guy that was taking down the camera—which was directly behind <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) head—a mere four minutes after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-47"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was shot. Everybody thought that it was very suspicious. I recognized the individual and reached out, had a conversation, saw the footage, and made the promise that I was not going to share it—although I said to you, I encouraged them to share it. I believe that the reason everybody is a conspiracy theorist is because people don't share truth, right? Once you share everything, there's no room for conspiracy. ^t-00-06-47

Like, this can obviously remove people from their conspiracies. And then it kind of occurred to me that what I shared was a bigger deal than I had imagined—by saying that I didn't see any blood. And that is a fact. I did not see any blood. <span id="claim-claim-61bac5fe98e3-t-00-07-29">In fact, the only blood that I did see at all—I'm talking about blood on the back—was on <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-29"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) hand, on <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) left hand, which—as many people have been saying—means that the blood moved forward.<a href="/claims/claim-61bac5fe98e3.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> We don't need to get into all of the gore. ^t-00-07-29

He runs a PR company, and his job is to respond to online chatter and online questions. And sometimes it may not even be what you want to say. In fact, it should never actually—if you're doing your job—be necessarily what you want to say. He also was very close to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. So I would imagine that he's under a tremendous amount of pressure. The company is moving in a different direction. These are—we are still just over a week after <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> lost his life—and he has to be the messenger. Who is directing that message? We don't know, but his job can't be easy at this moment, okay? If I say to my PR agent, "I want you to make this statement," he works for the company. ^t-00-10-06

So I think I would like to just respond to what is being said objectively, rather than to attack <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span>'s character. That aside, the statement objectively feels to me like the manipulation of a Christian audience, right? They know <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) audience is Christian. And therefore what they're selling to us is: "We—you should believe. You're a believer, right? As a Christian, you believe in miracles, right? Like, you believe in Christ and the miracles that Jesus performed, right? Well, then you should just believe this." There's something about that that I don't like. I don't like that. ^t-00-10-50

Yes, the conservative base is filled with <span id="ent-concept-christians-t-00-11-35"><a href="/entities/concept-christians.md">Christians</a></span>, but also the conservative base is filled with a lot of hunters, okay? People that hunt, and they know weapons, and they know how weapons work, and they know how weapons don't work. And this particular statement to me does not pass the sniff test. Now, again, when I shared that information, I had assumed they were going to say the angle went through this way.

Meaning that like, okay, we vote; we're citizens, but a separate group gets higher priority because of whatever reasons. "You look like you want to chime in." "That the entirety of the idea of a PAC is to represent a group, but the fact that we're allowing a group that doesn't even represent American interests to influence the people who are supposed to be representing us—I have a huge problem with.<span id="claim-claim-9be6bab99ee6-t-00-39-17">" "And that's why I've said this before, and a lot of people don't like when I say it: I actually think there's probably like 20 representatives between Senate and the House who I think are actually fully doing the work of the American people and don't have the i<a href="/claims/claim-9be6bab99ee6.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>nterests of some group pulling their sway." ^t-00-39-17

So that's a dangerous conversation to be hosting, is what I want to say. It's a very dangerous conversation to be hosting. It is incredible that he is—in his own words—six weeks ago, and they're just lying. To that young ethnically Jewish kid who said he was converting to Catholicism—amazing. If the spirit of what he was saying—if he was the leader and was the spokesperson in the political realm for the Jewish people—they would go a lot further. They would go a lot further. ^t-00-40-37

It's almost like they try to make you think you're in a psychosis, right? It's a level of gaslighting you've never seen before. It's like, "How could you say...

And I held the line. I said, "I'm not apologizing. If me saying genocide is always wrong brought tears to their eyes, then these people are demons." Like, what? Like, excuse me? So that's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it. And I also just want to say that <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-42-43"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a></span> was amazing last night as well. I know he's catching a lot of flak, but his message was very important. He shared the story of Christ and that these people who plot and lie and, you know, censor and pass laws—all it ever does inevitably is the exact opposite of what they're hoping that it does. And that really is the lesson of the Lord. That is the lesson of all of the plots failing. ^t-00-42-43

He was doing the thing that the people in charge hate most, which is calling for them to repent. So how is <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) message different? And <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was a political person who was deeply interested in coalition building and in getting the right people in office because he knew that vast improvements are possible politically. But he also knew that politics is not the final answer. It can't answer the deepest questions, actually. That the only real solution is Jesus. ^t-00-43-32

Politics, at its core, is a process of critiquing other people and getting them to change. Christianity—the gospel message, the message of Jesus—begins with repentance. Christianity calls upon you to change. Our core prayer—given to us by Jesus, the Lord's Prayer— demands that we forgive other people. But preceding that is a request for our forgiveness. ^t-00-44-16

Meditate on what we've done wrong, how we've fallen short. And then it becomes possible to forgive other people. That is a call to change our hearts from Jesus. And that is the only way forward." ^t-00-44-54

I'm not going to stop unless <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-45-12"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> asks me to stop—as I have said—or my father or my husband asks me to stop—because truth matters. And I think it is amazing that <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> found it in her heart to forgive, but it is also my belief that there are more people involved that are in need of forgiveness. Okay. Like I said, a lot more that I have found out. And I want to be really methodical about releasing information, but this one—they chose the wrong person. They chose the wrong person to take out. ^t-00-45-12

First, I wanna tell you guys about Nimi Skincare, because I know a lot of you guys ask me what I use to keep my skin looking healthy and glowing. And the answer is simple. It is Nimi Skincare. It's a part of my daily routine—also my nightly routine. If your skin is starting to show signs of aging—like fine lines creeping in, your skin is starting to sag a bit, or it's tired or uneven, or you feel like you're just kind of losing that youthful glow—then you should definitely try Nimi's anti-aging skincare line. Their products have worked wonders on me. Nimi's three-step anti-aging routine is packed with powerful, clinically-backed ingredients that work. ^t-00-45-51

It boosts collagen production; it reduces fine lines and wrinkles; it locks in moisture; and brightens for a healthy glow. And here's what I love the most: not only do the products deliver results, but Nimi is proudly American made. Every formula is crafted right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-46-36"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>—rivaling the best Korean skincare brands in quality—while staying true to our values of faith, family, and freedom. Right now Nimi is giving my listeners 15% off your order if you use the code Candace15 at checkout. But this offer ends soon. So do not wait to go to NimiSkincare.com today. Stock up on the three-step anti-aging routine and see the results for yourself. Support a brand that shares our values and take care of your skin at the same time. Visit NimiSkincare.com and use code Candace15. Also, let me remind you guys about American Financing, because the cost of everything is still out of control. ^t-00-46-36

If that debt is piling up, then you are not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing, but maybe hesitated to do so because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. There's good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC—which can have varied interest rates—the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment, giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes a 10-minute phone call to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now. ^t-00-47-20

"Also, the children that spoke yesterday sounded highly rehearsed on their quote-unquote experience." Okay, so to the first portion: I can tell you that I know Jack Posobiec. He has always been very solid with me. I mean, always. And Jack Posobiec—by the way—every single time that I have been attacked publicly, particularly over the declaration that Christ is King, it's like a trigger for Jack Posobiec. He goes hard in the paint. If you say you can't say "Christ is King," Jack Posobiec wants to go to war immediately—him and his brother. And that's great. So he's like a crusader. ^t-00-48-44

I'm running this business.'" They are losing—badly, badly. There's no question about that. Everyone can see it everywhere. And it's because of how they behave, right? The gaslighting, the threats, the intimidation. "We can control your life. We can call, and we'll create a firestorm so you won't be able to hit the stage at AmFest." People can see that, and they don't like that behavior. So when you do that—and then also say that you're the good guys— it doesn't ring true. ^t-00-50-57

I was happy to be canceled from anything to say what I felt in my heart to be true. And that is also the lesson of the story of Christ. You know—you have to tell the truth. You have to accept the punishment. And Christ will get you through it. ^t-00-53-40

I just haven't been able to catch you live." I didn't know that. I did not know that you don't even use a screwdriver to take that apart. They're... look—they're doing their best, okay?
