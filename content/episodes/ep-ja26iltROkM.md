Happy Monday. <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s wife), man. That—she really is just the moment. The speech that she gave—everybody was just wowed by her. I felt my energy personally, like last night going into that. I was effectively like soaring in the air above the convention center, like a dragon above, waiting for <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> to just be like, "And I was just gonna come down and swoop in out of nowhere." All the politicians, all the fake people—everyone was just gonna be in that moment toast. But she didn't call for war. <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> did not call for war. In fact, she did the exact opposite, which is what was so stunning. It was unbelievable. The forgiveness that she granted, the strength that it took for her to call for that forgiveness<span id="event-event-2025-09-12-assassination-site-area-repaved-within-48-hours-of-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-12-assassination-site-area-repaved-within-48-hours-of.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>— ^t-00-00-00

And I was being serious when I tweeted that. I think it was— the most consequential speech in American history, a message that everyone needed to hear, including myself—a message of complete submission to Christ. And by the way, later on, we're also going to discuss another kind of submission to Christ, which is submitting yourself to<span id="event-event-2025-09-22-kash-patel-issues-fbi-statement-on-thorough-kirk-a-t-00-00-44"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-22-kash-patel-issues-fbi-statement-on-thorough-kirk-a.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> truth. <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash Patel</a></span> has now come out and issued a statement fully capitulating to the public, the public insistence that they're lying to us. They are so clearly lying to us about what happened on the day<span id="event-event-2025-07-01-charlie-kirk-hosts-town-hall-discussing-anti-semit-t-00-00-44"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-01-charlie-kirk-hosts-town-hall-discussing-anti-semit.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-21-tucker-carlson-speaks-at-convention-honoring-charl-t-00-00-44"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-21-tucker-carlson-speaks-at-convention-honoring-charl.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> lost his life. Nothing they've told us thus far makes any sense, and somehow it's only getting worse. So welcome back. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-01-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=86" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Let's jump right into this. I have to say, any woman that can get on stage and meaningfully say that they forgive the person who killed their husband that quickly— you are truly a better person than me, because I've just been so angry, so angry. And yet she was able to, through tears—and obviously you could tell how difficult that moment was for her— but she arrived at forgiveness, and she did it in front of the entire world. ^t-00-01-26

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-02-10.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=130" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I think that every single person should watch that speech. Truly, they should watch that speech. They should watch <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a>'<span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">s</a></span> speech. I don't think even showing you clips of it—I'm gonna show you one—could do it justice. You should watch it in its entirety. The emotion, the message of it. And you can obviously see why <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> fell in love with her. I remember meeting <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. We were at... <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and I were in <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york.md">New York</a></span> for something or another, and he was falling for her hard, but he wanted to play it cool. He wanted to play it cool, so he's like, "Come meet her at Del Frisco's in <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-city-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york-city.md">New York City</a></span>." And I came there, and she was just lovely. She was genuinely such a nice person. I was like, "<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, just go for it." Just go for it. And he did go for it. And last night, I really do think that the entire world needed to hear her message. ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-02-53.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:53</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=173" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** What you took from it, how you could apply it to your life— is up to you. But specifically, the part that she shared that provided me with so much peace—and I needed to hear it, truly—was when she explained that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-53"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> did not suffer. Because that—thinking about that is... I just—I really shed so many tears over it, just thinking that he suffered even for a moment. It was my favorite part of her speech, so I'm gonna play that right now. (<span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-02-53"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> clip) ^t-00-02-53

And then he blinked. He blinked and saw his Savior in paradise. And all the heavenly mysteries were revealed to him. ^t-00-03-22

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-04-04.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:04</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=244" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I mean, that—it's just beautiful. And to really think about that—that he just blinked and then he was with the Lord. And it is just a fact that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-04"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> just loved the Lord. It was constantly, like I told you, going through the conversations and how much he would just say, "I need to pray about it. I need to pray about it. I need to pray about it," wanting to marry <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-04-04"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. First thing he said—which I think I showed you guys last week—and <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> is correct. It is important to remember that message of forgiveness that we have within ourselves. And it sometimes feels very hard to do that, but we are called upon to forgive people, to forgive our enemies—even in moments that it seems impossible or extraordinary to do so. ^t-00-04-04

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-04-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=281" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But it is also important—it's not really a "but," but I want to assert that it is also important to remember that what Christ is, as I said at the top of this show— is truth, right? Christ is truth. And we are not getting the truth right now of what happened to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-41"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> on 9-10. And to be very clear, I am going to need it. I demand it. In fact, I'm now currently working on a minute-by-minute timeline, which I will have for you guys later this week, of what exactly happened in the seconds and minutes following <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> getting shot. I need to know. I need to follow bodies. I've already been able to, as I asked over the weekend, locate <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-04-41"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span> in the crowd. ^t-00-04-41

I mean, that's him right there. Thank you to the person that sent this picture. But then I find him on video, and I'm trying to understand how he made it down the pathway and was taken through to the same area that they had just taken <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-25"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> in the car. I have a lot of questions, and each and every one of them will be answered by the end of this investigation. And I also want to put it to you this way: so much more has come to light that I have not yet presented. I am working with other journalists—different aspects—asking them, "Hey, you look into this. I'm going to look into that." ^t-00-05-25

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-06-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=365" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And the first thing that I think I should make abundantly clear is I am relieved that <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-06-05"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> is at the head of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-06-05"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, because just like I alluded to last week—and which I will double down on now—I believe that people<span id="event-event-2025-09-21-erika-kirk-delivers-forgiveness-speech-at-conventi-t-00-06-05"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-21-erika-kirk-delivers-forgiveness-speech-at-conventi.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> within that company betrayed <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, okay? That's just what I believe right now. And I want to make sure that I have these facts entirely on my side before I tell you guys more. I will say, if you are a rat on a ship, you should probably flee now. I recommend it. Anyways, you guys, on Friday we did an episode. ^t-00-06-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-06-47.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:47</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=407" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I wanna be clear: I didn't think that that episode was going to have the reaction that it did, but I am grateful. We were unpacking the footage that was going viral of the guy that was taking down the camera—which was directly behind <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) head—a mere four minutes after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-47"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was shot. Everybody thought that it was very suspicious. I recognized the individual and reached out, had a conversation, saw the footage, and made the promise that I was not going to share it—although I said to you, I encouraged them to share it. I believe that the reason everybody is a conspiracy theorist is because people don't share truth, right? Once you share everything, there's no room for conspiracy. ^t-00-06-47

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-07-29.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:29</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=449" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And when I was sharing what I saw, I was doing so because I was just thinking that, you know, this could help. Like, this can obviously remove people from their conspiracies. And then it kind of occurred to me that what I shared was a bigger deal than I had imagined—by saying that I didn't see any blood. And that is a fact. I did not see any blood. In fact, the only blood that I did see at all—I'm talking about blood on the back—was on <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-29"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) hand, on <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) left hand, which—as many people have been saying—means that the blood moved forward. We don't need to get into all of the gore. ^t-00-07-29

How was<a href="/events/event-2025-09-20-andrew-kolvet-tweets-explanation-of-no-exit-wound.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a> there nothing in the back if this is<span id="event-event-2025-09-20-andrew-kolvet-tweets-explanation-of-no-exit-wound-t-00-08-07"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-20-andrew-kolvet-tweets-explanation-of-no-exit-wound.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> the gun that was used?" <a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a> tweeted this over the weekend. (<a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a> tweet) "I want to address some of the discussion about the lack of an exit wound with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-07"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. I'm usually not interested in delving into most of this kind of online chatter, and I apologize that this is somewhat graphic. But in this case, the fact that there wasn't an exit wound is probably another miracle, and I want people to know. I just spoke with the surgeon who worked on <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> in the hospital. ^t-00-08-07

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-08-50.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:50</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=530" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He said the bullet, quote, 'absolutely should have gone through,' which is very, very normal for a high-powered, high-velocity round. 'I've seen wounds from this caliber many times, and they always just go through everything. This would have taken a moose or two down, an elk, et cetera,' end quote. And then now this is <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-08-50"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew</a></span>: 'But it didn't go through. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) body stopped it. I mentioned to his doctor that there were dozens of staff, students, and special guests standing directly behind <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-50"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> on the other side of the tent, and he replied, "It was an absolute miracle that someone else didn't get killed." ^t-00-08-50

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-09-29.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:29</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=569" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** His bone—referring to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-29"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>—was so healthy and the density was so, so impressive that he's like the Man of Steel. It should have just gone through and through. It likely would have killed those standing behind him too. In the end, the coroner did find the bullet just beneath the skin. Even in death, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> managed to save the lives of those around him. Remarkable and miraculous." End statement. Now, first I want to say this, because people were attacking <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-09-29"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span> immediately: I want to say that it is good to remember that this is <a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a>'s literal job. ^t-00-09-29

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ja26iltROkM/t-00-10-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja26iltROkM&t=606" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, he is a PR agent. He runs a PR company, and his job is to respond to online chatter and online questions. And sometimes it may not even be what you want to say. In fact, it should never actually—if you're doing your job—be necessarily what you want to say. He also was very close to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. So I would imagine that he's under a tremendous amount of pressure. The company is moving in a different direction. These are—we are still just over a week after <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> lost his life—and he has to be the messenger. Who is directing that message? We don't know, but his job can't be easy at this moment, okay? If I say to my PR agent, "I want you to make this statement," he works for the company. ^t-00-10-06

So I think I would like to just respond to what is being said objectively, rather than to attack <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span>'s character. That aside, the statement objectively feels to me like the manipulation of a Christian audience, right? They know <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) audience is Christian. And therefore what they're selling to us is: "We—you should believe. You're a believer, right? As a Christian, you believe in miracles, right? Like, you believe in Christ and the miracles that <span id="ent-person-jesus-christ-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/person-jesus-christ.md">Jesus</a></span> performed, right? Well, then you should just believe this." There's something about that that I don't like. I don't like that. ^t-00-10-50

Yes, the conservative base is filled with <span id="ent-concept-christians-t-00-11-35"><a href="/entities/concept-christians.md">Christians</a></span>, but also the conservative base is filled with a lot of hunters, okay? People that hunt, and they know weapons, and they know how weapons work, and they know how weapons don't work. And this particular statement to me does not pass the sniff test. Now, again, when I shared that information, I had assumed they were going to say the angle went through this way. I did not imagine they were just going to say that it was a miracle. <span id="ent-person-alex-jones-t-00-11-35"><a href="/entities/person-alex-jones.md">Alex Jones</a></span>—he immediately took to X live.

Again, I don't know anything about ballistics, but I've been very clear that we will be exploring every lead until we get a proper answer for what happened.

It's a part of my daily routine—also my nightly routine.

Every formula is crafted right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-46-36"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>—rivaling the best Korean skincare brands in quality—while staying true to our values of faith, family, and freedom.

If that debt is piling up, then you are not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at <span id="ent-org-american-financing-t-00-47-20"><a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a></span>, but maybe hesitated to do so because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. There's good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC—which can have varied interest rates—the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment, giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes a 10-minute phone call to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call <a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a> and start saving now. ^t-00-47-20

Nobody knows, but I would like to see the tunnel network. Hey, I don't know how you do that. There's probably some radar you can buy to see where the tunnels are. You're just a student on the campus. If it's legal—obviously. I have no idea if it's legal. Do not do anything illegal. I don't know if you can just buy... All I know is that the laser stuff that I use to see if there's a stud in the wall—and that's perfectly legal. ^t-00-52-17

As you guys can see, I am— I was never going to be an engineer in life. Clearly, I was never going to be an engineer in life. But I do know a little bit about plumbing. My dad was a plumber, and I know that there's got to be a whole network under there if they're supporting a waterfall in that amphitheater style. It's like a whole thing. They have a whole thing on their website on <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-53-01"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> about how the irrigation is maintained and who's in charge of it. I would like people to look into that. Enough said. All right, let's get into some comments from today. Marzi—thank you for that donation. Marzi writes: "Dark forces want us to fight amongst each other. We need to come together and fight this evil." ^t-00-53-01

Marzi continues: "Netanyahu is using <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-53-40"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) death to distract us from the ongoing genocide in <span id="ent-gpe-gaza-t-00-53-40"><a href="/entities/gpe-gaza.md">Gaza</a></span>."

This person writes: "The internet is back in <span id="ent-gpe-palestine-t-00-53-40"><a href="/entities/gpe-palestine.md">Palestine</a></span>, and people are speaking out." Yep. And I have been somebody that has spoken out, and it came at great risk. And I am very happy that I did. I have no regrets. I was happy to be canceled from anything to say what I felt in my heart to be true. And that is also the lesson of the story of Christ. You know—you have to tell the truth. You have to accept the punishment. And Christ will get you through it. ^t-00-53-40

Hurricane Ian writes—oh, hurricane, but spelled "hurrican": "What happened to the screwdriver? They said they found it on the roof—even though you don't use a screwdriver to take that rifle apart." No way. I didn't even realize that. Sorry if you've talked about this. I have not. I don't think so. "I've watched all your videos—been meaning to ask you. I just haven't been able to catch you live." I didn't know that. I did not know that you don't even use a screwdriver to take that apart. They're... look—they're doing their best, okay? They're doing their best to come up with a story that works, and none of them do.

God bless and protect you." Yeah, I mean—I thought his speech was not the direction that I would have gone in had I been invited to speak. I am not saying, yeah, like he's guilty about something. But I am saying that like a lot of people had that feeling having watched his speech. And, of course, I think he was a Marine in the past before... I don't know. I really don't know what to say about that. He gave the speech that he wanted to give, and nothing in my research has come up about—thus far has come up about—<span id="ent-person-frank-turek-t-00-55-02"><a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank Turek</a></span>.

And as the <span id="ent-org-daily-mail-t-00-55-47"><a href="/entities/org-daily-mail.md">Daily Mail</a></span> pointed out, I raged and raged about that. I freaked out and threw everything—threw my toys out of the pram. Payne Revere writes: "Why didn't the local police department treat it like it was a crime scene? Two: on what basis is the FBI involved?" That's a good point. "Three: intel recruits heavily from the LDS—that is a fact—Latter-day Saints, Church of Latter-day Saints. And apparently they recruit from that particular campus—which I found out—which is interesting." Again, we'll get into all that this week.

Look—I think by the time we're done investigating this, we're gonna have a lot of questions about who had the audacity to honor him last night. I think so. I'm just feeling it.

Why did you lay your head next to your wife or your husband? My husband knows everything there is to know about me. And so, yeah—there's no question that she knows everything. I saw people that were going: "<span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-57-12"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> is going on—I think—<span id="ent-person-alex-clark-t-00-57-12"><a href="/entities/person-alex-clark.md">Alex Clark</a></span>'s show."

I didn't say 150 million was offered because I don't know the exact amount <a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> offered him. I said 150 million dollars I was told <a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> gave for Operation Mockingpastor. Remember when all the pastors one weekend got up on stage and were like, "<a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-57-53"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a></span> and <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-57-53"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Owens</a></span>?" That is what I was told. That was 150 million dollars went into that. But I definitively made the statement that <a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> offered <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-57-53"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Kirk</a></span> a boatload of money, and he rejected it.

He obviously didn't convert, but also the nastiness towards Catholics just needs to stop—point blank. I mean, <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-58-36"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> was raised in a Catholic family, so that was a strange thing to have people react so crazy. I don't lie because I always know that eventually daylight comes in, and things get exposed. And so I'm excited to hear her speak about the pressure that he was under—as was alluded to by <span id="ent-person-alex-clark-t-00-58-36"><a href="/entities/person-alex-clark.md">Alex Clark</a></span>—to speak about whether or not he was offered more money—whether he lost money, which he did. ^t-00-58-36

I mean, there was more than just him—obviously—but he was getting pressure from donors. I mean, I think he said it on a show. So, yeah—daylight is always the best disinfectant. Anyways, you guys—thank you for all the support. We're going to have an incredible week. More stuff to reveal to you.
