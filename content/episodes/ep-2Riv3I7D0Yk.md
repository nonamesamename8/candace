That's an expression, obviously, that we use a lot. And I have this thing where I always have to go back and research and figure out why we use common expressions, because nobody actually thinks about those things anymore. Well, this one is pretty obvious. It refers to when soldiers would use a petard—essentially a bucket-shaped explosive device packed with gunpowder, effectively a bomb—to blow up the gates and wall fortifications of their enemies. They'd light the fuse. They would be hoisted by their own bombs. And that's exactly what is happening right now to <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-01-27"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span> for weeks after the assassination of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-27"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. ^t-00-01-27

And it actually reminds me of my favorite story ever. So it was about 2,000 years ago in <span id="ent-gpe-jerusalem-t-00-04-50"><a href="/entities/gpe-jerusalem.md">Jerusalem</a></span>, and Jesus shows up and he starts talking about the people in power, and he starts doing the worst thing that you can do, which is telling the truth about people, and they hate it. And they just go bonkers. They hate it. And they become obsessed with making him stop. This guy's got to stop talking. We've got to shut this guy up. ^t-00-04-50

We must make him stop talking. And there's always one guy with the bright idea, and I can just hear him say, I've got an idea. Why don't we just kill him? That'll shut him up. That'll fix the problem. It doesn't work that way. It doesn't work that way. Everything is inverted, and the Beatitudes tell it, I think, the most crisply. Everything is sort of the opposite of what you think it's going to be. That is a fact. ^t-00-05-26

This is kind of the beginning of kind of the last kind of foray into so-called criminal justice reform. And even back then, there was a lot of chatter among my more liberal classmates about how, you know, incarceration and prisons lock you up. You know how all of this just racist is—kind of like it is an old kind of symbol of a white patriarchal, colonialist, imperial society there—and how the ultimate goal is basically to defund the prisons. And then, you know, if some people are going to commit some violent crimes, you know, essentially let the chips fall where they may. Well, you know, this is when the chips fall where they may. But most American people have not lost their minds. ^t-00-09-35

So I decided to do what I always do rather than say what he definitely meant or what he didn't mean. I decided to just create a micro timeline of <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-10-26"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span>'s tweets.

This is what <a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a> tweeted. He tweeted a total of nine times on <a href="/entities/date-september-4th.md">September 9th</a>, and you can gather what was going on that day from his tweets.

It's a very common political talking point. It is absolutely not a typical or a regular political talking point or debate regarding public executions. We don't—we don't talk about that often. It's an exceedingly specific ask, right? Usually reserved to a visceral response to something that you have seen and in the moment, right? <span id="ent-person-matt-walsh-t-00-13-03"><a href="/entities/person-matt-walsh.md">Matt Walsh</a></span>—actually, we're prepping the show—I said I will guarantee you that when that footage got dropped, which was on September 5th, four days earlier, <a href="/entities/person-matt-walsh.md">Matt Walsh</a> would have tweeted this person should be publicly executed. And by the way, he did. He didn't. He said, "We can't keep living like this. ^t-00-13-03

This guy had multiple previous arrests. He should have already been serving 30 years in the labor camp. This is the only way, as our ancestors knew. We've tried compassion and restorative justice, and this is the result. It was inevitable." So <span id="ent-person-matt-walsh-t-00-13-45"><a href="/entities/person-matt-walsh.md">Matt Walsh</a></span> then went on his show and further explained that already contextualized tweet, and he explained how men have a visceral response when you see somebody being victimized—a woman being victimized in that way that <span id="ent-person-irina-zarutska-t-00-13-45"><a href="/entities/person-irina-zarutska.md">Irina</a></span> was. So we decided, for good measure, that we should check to see if maybe it was something regular that <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-13-45"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span> also spoke about, which is public executions. ^t-00-13-45

The first time that he tweeted about a public execution was back in 2013. And he said it in reference—I'm sorry, in <span id="ent-date-2022-t-00-14-29"><a href="/entities/date-2022.md">2022</a></span>—and he said it in reference to the Boston Marathon bombing terrorist account.

And for that reason, I am saying that this would have been an appropriate scenario for a public execution." Emotions are running high. You are visceral, and you're learning things. You're seeing and you're learning those things in the moment. As I said, that would make sense in its context. I also want to remind you that <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-15-07"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span> is a lawyer by training. He was at one point the editor-at-large of <span id="ent-org-the-daily-wire-t-00-15-07"><a href="/entities/org-the-daily-wire.md">the Daily Wire</a></span>, and he is currently the senior editor-at-large at <span id="ent-org-newsweek-t-00-15-07"><a href="/entities/org-newsweek.md">Newsweek</a></span>.

He certainly understands you don't just send out a standalone tweet at nine o'clock p.m., and everyone's just gonna go, "What are you referring to?" He knows the public is not going to comprehend what he means outside of him providing some further context. And I will also add here that it is not particularly helpful that <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-15-51"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span> as an individual is obsessively angry.

Which kind of metaphor? Can you run that tweet again? I do know a little bit about metaphors and similes. "Jew hatred is inherent in European DNA." How's that for a metaphor, guys, for you? Because I thought metaphor might be "fire hair" to describe somebody who's red-headed. Oh, no, it's not literally fire. It's fire, fire red.

I mean, it's like, hey, he literally says his last thing he said to me actually was like, "I'm just gonna plug your book." What he wanted to do on this tour was just to plug <a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a>'s book. And it's so sad that he never had the opportunity to plug <a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a>'s book. Now let's keep with this interview because he's going to be asked more specifically about certain characters in the movement that are trying to quote-unquote hijack <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s legacy by telling the truth, and remarkably, he is going to work—I swear—he's going to work on his book again.

The hatred is deep; it's sinister; it's evil. And they have sent virtually every foot soldier that they have available to attack us repeatedly, right? Or attack us repeatedly, make videos.

"I can't comment on <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-47-43"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> because it's quite obviously a freak show.

And I'm coming out of the grief stage and realizing I think that was an element of this: to send a signal to shoot him in the throat, right?

They are dangerous, and they are haughty, and they are growing increasingly desperate. And panicked people that are evil in this way are not people that you wanna play with, right?

She comes out and says, 'Yeah, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-53-36"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was calling me, wanting me out of his events again and all the rest of it, and he was also really concerned about the <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-53-36"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> lobby coming after him.' And they said, 'You're a liar. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> didn't like you. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> didn't call you. He didn't text you.' And so she let him set up for a few weeks and then released it: the text. And then she said, 'Yeah, he was really upset with the <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a> lobby and said he was breaking with them entirely. He wouldn't be bullied by them.' In the weeks before he was killed, they said, 'You're a liar. That's not true.' So she released those two days ago. Now she says she has the proof, and it's text messages ^t-00-53-36

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-54-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:54:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=3260" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Alex Jones:** that he feared for his life in the two days of—or the day before he was killed. And predictably they're already saying she's a liar. And she's going to release those. And she's also sent out the dead man's switch— just like <span id="ent-person-james-o-keefe-t-00-54-20"><a href="/entities/person-james-o-keefe.md">James O'Keefe</a></span> did to myself and a few others right before he released the stuff on Prince Andrew—which is dangerous, by the way—proving that he indeed raped the girls and covered it up.

Man's a champion. But the point is, is that this is a real dead man's switch. She has sent out to the Tate brothers, <span id="ent-person-dave-smith-t-00-55-04"><a href="/entities/person-dave-smith.md">Dave Smith</a></span>, <span id="ent-person-max-blumenthal-t-00-55-04"><a href="/entities/person-max-blumenthal.md">Max Blumenthal</a></span>, <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-55-04"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>, and others. Well, I'm trying to get her on for weeks. I'm a little bummed out she didn't send it to me, because I'd like to stand with her, but we do stand with her. So they're already out saying she's a liar. She's going to release that. Now, this doesn't prove <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-55-04"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> killed him or a lobby around that, because I've seen no evidence. You know, they said in security detail it was <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israeli</a>. They weren't. ^t-00-55-04

I said you can certainly say <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-55-50"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>'s a suspect, but I said, 'I need to see proof. We need to figure out the ballistics and who really shot him and all that before we then, you know, start saying, okay, you know, motive.' I mean, you can always look at motive, but first with the forensic situation: are they covering it up? What's the ballistics? That's just where I am. I'm not gonna just say something because people think it. But when she releases this, she's got it. Make no mistake. Just like she keeps bringing the goods. And she just sets the hook with the worm on it or puts the mousetrap out with the cheese on it. And they come out and say, 'You're a liar.' And she goes, 'Boom.' 'You're a liar.' Boom. 'You're a liar.' Boom. 'You're a liar.' ^t-00-55-50

Bam. The show. And she'll let them, you know, for a week or so kind of stew and say she's a liar. And then she'll just release it. And then what she's saying is, 'You kill me, it doesn't matter. It's coming out.' And the word is he specifically thought <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-56-35"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> was going to kill him." Even <span id="ent-person-michael-savage-t-00-56-35"><a href="/entities/person-michael-savage.md">Michael Savage</a></span> first—a few months ago—said, "Netanyahu needs to go on my show."

He didn't say it was off-record. It was during the break. So there are a lot of groups that want <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-56-35"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> killed. He was defeating the Democrats with <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-56-35"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a></span>. ^t-00-56-35

So I see them as the motive, and they said we want <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-57-17"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> dead. They said they celebrated when he was dead. He had like six trantifa say, "<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> be dead tomorrow." Then they said, "See, we told you." And that was in the town. So, you know, we got trantifa—the tranny <span id="ent-org-antifa-t-00-57-17"><a href="/entities/org-antifa.md">Antifa</a></span>—running around, engaged in all sorts of violence everywhere.

And it's really just been this insane behavior of covering up and lying that makes us question things. Like that's the reality. And by the way, questioning things doesn't mean that we have any proof that that happened, which is why we've been actually reticent to say that. But they're not acting right.

I also do want to add here—show you a clip before we get into some of your comments—that it's also very good to not extend to everyone that is Jewish the viewpoints of this very radical sect that has a lot of power in America. People like <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-58-39"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span> don't get fired when they explicitly express that, you know, they hate white people, whatever.

And I always say I'm grateful that I did, because when you engage into politics, what you see is so ugly that you just go, "Oh my gosh, coming into stereotypes. You're living up every stereotype." But what you're seeing is the stranglehold of <span id="ent-org-aipac-t-00-59-21"><a href="/entities/org-aipac.md">AIPAC</a></span>. It is a political organization. And I always say if you look at any lobby in D.C., it'll make you hate someone, right? Pharmaceutical lobby will make you hate the pharmaceutical companies. The Jewish lobby will make you hate Jews. The black caucus will make you hate black people. And so people that go to D.C. are incredibly corrupt. Money rules them, and they become powerful. Power corrupts. Absolutely.

I liked it because it made Jews seem cool, but that was also kind of confusing. Because I was like, okay, how did we go from crossing the desert to now being known as generally frail?

It's funny, and it's good to remind yourself that politics is serious all the time, but most of the people do not behave like psychopaths, and they're very funny and can make fun of themselves. Uh, are going to read a couple sponsors before I get to you guys' comments. We're going to tell you first of all about Home Title Lock because if you are a homeowner, need to listen to this. The FBI has been warning homeowners about a type of real estate fraud on the rise, which is title theft. This type of theft doesn't happen by breaking down your doors and stealing your stuff. It happens with just a one-page document, a forged signature, and it gets filed to the county. And if your title—which is a legal record of your ownership—gets transferred out of your name, criminals can use your ownership to drain your equity or even sell your property. And you won't even know about it until you start getting collection notices or foreclosure notices in the mail. ^t-01-01-42

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-01-02-26.md" class="timestamp-link">01:02:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=3746" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock so that you can protect your equity and find out today if you're already a victim. You can use my promo code CANDACE at HomeTitleLock.com, and you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock protection. That's 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes, and if fraud occurs, their U.S.-based restoration team will spend up to $1 million to fix it. Again, HomeTitleLock.com, promo code CANDACE. I also want to tell you guys about American Financing because the cost of everything is still out of control. Many people are relying on credit cards to cover essentials. If that debt is piling up, you should know you're not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing, but maybe hesitated because you didn't want to give up your low mortgage rate. ^t-01-02-26

Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment. It'll give you peace of mind. The loan will allow you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing loan mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started with no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now. Call 800-795-1210—that's 800-795-1210—or visit AmericanFinancing.net slash Owens. ^t-01-03-11

But that transition is tough on our skin sometimes. The end of the summer sun, the new autumn wind can leave us feeling tired, dry, dull. If you're looking in the mirror and you're feeling like your skin has lost its radiance with the season, then I should tell you about my absolute go-to: Neeme Skincare. Neeme is the reason that my skin stays clear, firm, glowing, no matter what the weather brings. Their three-step anti-aging routine is perfect—a perfect defense for the seasonal shift. It's packed with powerful clinically backed ingredients that work to restore your skin's barrier—which is exactly what you need to fight off that dry autumn air. It boosts collagen production. It helps with those fine lines. It locks in deep moisture, and it brightens your complexion, bringing back that healthy glow that you had during the summer. ^t-01-03-47

They always say, "There's a Trump tweet for everything," and then people will pass it around for certain situations. Do you think that that is what he was doing in the context of what was going on that day, which was really the focus of his tweets seemed to be talking about <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-01-05-12"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>—as always—and going after <span id="ent-gpe-qatar-t-01-05-12"><a href="/entities/gpe-qatar.md">Qatar</a></span> and <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-01-05-12"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>, as always. What are you guys thinking? Corey Henry, thank you for that donation. "Hey, sister from another mother, hire more security. I fear for you now. Please stay safe. Prayers for you and yours.

He actually outright purchased a security company, and it didn't matter. And they didn't do anything. It clearly was an act of vanity. They should never be allowed to work again because why would you not have—I mean, he's a sitting duck. The amount that he was paying for that security for them to not check rooftops. You could have someone actually requiring that you have access to rooftops. You could have one of your guys on a rooftop. Wouldn't that be a good idea? I don't know. I just—I don't understand it. Kelly Gibbs writes, "My Catholic bestie and I keep you in our prayers." Thank you, Kelly, for this gift. "Rosary and divine mercy. I pray that our Lord and Lady protect you and your family, give you wisdom, and safeguard the pearl of great price: the faith passed down from the apostles." Thank you so much. ^t-01-05-57

And like I said, <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> has fantastic people that worked and signed up to work for that company and dedicated their time with that company—whether even volunteers, people on college campuses—because they believed in truth, and they knew they were getting it from <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-01-06-41"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>.

And to the extent that they do that, fantastic. They will have an ally in me. I never attacked <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-01-07-18"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> because it came from <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a>. And I saw what it took to build that company because I was a part of building that company. But to the extent that we feel that they've become so corporate that they're not answering our questions or making us feel ashamed for asking these questions or just like feeling like they don't care about getting to truth— I think it was very sloppy what <span id="ent-person-tyler-bowyer-t-01-07-18"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-bowyer.md">Tyler Bowyer</a></span> did on X. He was accusatory; he called people names. To that extent, they won't survive. That is just a reality. I can't fix that, right? ^t-01-07-18

It will feel to them like a betrayal to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-01-08-03"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s legacy. 'Cause that's how it feels to me, right? We're all feeling it together. That's the point. And so we offer this as a course correction for them. You know, I want to believe that they're just grieving in a weird way, that they have a ton of things on their plates. Maybe they're fearful for their own lives. I don't know. But if that were the truth, they could still get the truth out to other people. And that is something I want you to know that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was remarkable at. And that's why I always say spend a <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. Never took the bait on people saying, "He's this; he's this." <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was very good at knowing he's the guy they'll get in the room.

I mean, he was—as someone put it today—he was a maestro. He really was. He's like, "That's the drum, you know, so we're going to need the bass. You're going to need to be the strings. I'm going to play this, and we are—we're going to have a symphony." They're not working with the fighters. It feels like they're working with the feds. They've said explicitly they're working with the feds. So I don't know what to make of that, but I hear you. I hear you, and I feel the same way. I want <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-01-08-45"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> to survive, but I want them to be truthful first.

And it's a parody because we don't want to be in the CIA. We think there's a lot of corruption there. Actually, I'm hoping one day my team will let me have the green hat. They never sent it to me. So hopefully if you know someone—somebody get me that green CIA hat because it's actually—people are tagging me in, and I don't have it. And it's really nice. Other than that, you guys, thank you so much for your support, and we'll see you tomorrow. ^t-01-15-04
