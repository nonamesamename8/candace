**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. Happy Wednesday. Sorry, we're running late today. I'm starting homeschooling, so still getting adjusted to the new schedule. Where should we begin? Okay, well, Josh Hammer, because that's certainly getting a little more interesting, maybe a bit darker than we had anticipated. Because just 16 hours before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated, he mysteriously retweeted a 2013 tweet from Donald Trump calling for public executions. Now I have tried, and I don't feel that there is any way that I can confidently explain to you guys why he tweeted that, least of all in the context of him having already admitted that he and a rabbi in Israel had a long talk with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) the night before he died—something he was very proud of. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=44" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-00-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Also, Dinesh D'Souza has jumped into the mix. Welcome, Dinesh D'Souza. He is joining every commentator who hates Candace (Candace Owens). That's nice that he has entered the fray. He's got some things to say to me. We're gonna discuss it because it's weird. And I'm also going to explain to you why, more formally, at least why I decided to activate an effective kill switch. I want you guys to pay attention because this is really important. Welcome back to Candace (Candace Owens). ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=87" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-01-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Hoisted by his own petard. That's an expression, obviously, that we use a lot. And I have this thing where I always have to go back and research and figure out why we use common expressions, because nobody actually thinks about those things anymore. Well, this one is pretty obvious. It refers to when soldiers would use a petard—essentially a bucket-shaped explosive device packed with gunpowder, effectively a bomb—to blow up the gates and wall fortifications of their enemies. They'd light the fuse. They would be hoisted by their own bombs. And that's exactly what is happening right now to Josh Hammer for weeks after the assassination of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-01-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=130" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-02-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Josh Hammer obsessively and shamelessly accused people of lying, people of grifting, people of attempting to destroy Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s legacy. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was his friend, he claimed rather maniacally. That Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never once flinched on the topic of Israel. He died just loving Israel. It was like, are you kidding me? That's all he cared about. Check out just some of these tweets, by the way. This is a collage. We just don't have all day here to gather crazy Josh Hammer tweets, but you get the idea. There is a repulsive op right now to hijack Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s legacy. There is a repulsive op right now desecrating Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s memory by trying to posthumously convert him to grifterism. ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=174" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-02-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I can't believe there's something known as grifterism. I was given access to this letter a few months ago, and I read it at that time. Tucker (Tucker Carlson), Candace (Candace Owens), and other bad faith actors are lying through their teeth about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Israel. Candace (Candace Owens) and other grifters. You get that back up for a quick second. Candace (Candace Owens) and other grifters are trying to posthumously rewrite and hijack the legacy of the great Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to further their patently evil ends. There has been a repulsive op, op, op. The reality is simple. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a bridge. Like it's weird that he keeps repeating that sentence. Like I said, maniacal, obsessed. ^t-00-02-54

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=213" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-03-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And of course in the comfort of his own derangement and with the full support of the press and the silence of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s other quote-unquote friends, Josh was really acting the part of a true Pharisee. He was certain that the truth would not rise again. He was so confident he had killed it and that he could himself hijack the legacy of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Except the truth did kind of rise again. It kind of always does rise again. And the world now knows that Josh Hammer had personal intimate knowledge that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s views were changing. He lied about the Hamptons meeting. I've told you the truth from day one. Seth Dillon and Josh were personally upset with Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s defiance against the state of Israel. ^t-00-03-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=257" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-04-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Seth Dillon was the more vocal of the two parties in the Hamptons, as I said, in terms of actually pressing Charlie (Charlie Kirk), but both of them were upset about the way that they saw his viewpoints shifting, and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) was therefore correct at Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s memorial. It was definitely the correct analogy when he spoke about these sorts of individuals who plot and lie and think that they are going to be successful in, well, murdering the truth in the story of Jesus Christ. Take a listen. (Clip of Tucker Carlson:) ^t-00-04-17

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=290" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-04-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have loved this, not just because he loved large groups of people, but because ultimately he was a Christian evangelist. And it actually reminds me of my favorite story ever. So it was about 2,000 years ago in Jerusalem, and Jesus shows up and he starts talking about the people in power, and he starts doing the worst thing that you can do, which is telling the truth about people, and they hate it. And they just go bonkers. They hate it. And they become obsessed with making him stop. This guy's got to stop talking. We've got to shut this guy up. ^t-00-04-50

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=326" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-05-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** And I can just sort of picture the scene in a lamp-lit room with a bunch of guys sitting around eating hummus, thinking about what do we do about this guy telling the truth about us. We must make him stop talking. And there's always one guy with the bright idea, and I can just hear him say, I've got an idea. Why don't we just kill him? That'll shut him up. That'll fix the problem. It doesn't work that way. It doesn't work that way. Everything is inverted, and the Beatitudes tell it, I think, the most crisply. Everything is sort of the opposite of what you think it's going to be. That is a fact. ^t-00-05-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=367" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-06-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** It will always be the opposite of what we think it's going to be when you are attacking people who are telling the truth. ^t-00-06-07

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=373" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-06-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And the truth is that is now an established fact, like I said, that Josh Hammer knew that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s perspectives on Israel were changing. And since that announcement, Twitter users pointed out a very strange tweet that Josh Hammer hit send on 16 hours before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated, for no apparent reason at all. He retweeted something that President Donald Trump had sent a full 12 years ago about public executions. Here it is. Here is that retweet. Trump wrote on April 19th, 2013: "Should be public execution for all to see. You will end this bull fast." And Josh Hammer just replies and says, "Based," you can see. ^t-00-06-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=419" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-06-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** This is—we are in central time—so that's about 9:05 p.m. Eastern time. Now what is the justification for this? There might be one. I tried in earnest to at first rationalize it, right? What could have been going on that Josh Hammer decided to dig through the 2013 Twitter archives and retweet someone calling for a public execution? Well, I'll let one of the many Zionist PR agents explain it first. Yashar Ali, who, like I said, is quite literally paid to do PR for Zionists. I know this personally, on the right and on the left, tried to explain it away by kind of lying, I would say. ^t-00-06-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=455" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-07-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He tried to claim definitively that Josh was referring to the criminal who horrifically murdered the Ukrainian refugee, Irina Zarutska, in North Carolina. That was obviously a big story in the beginning of September. Yashar Ali wrote this: "Last night, Candace (Candace Owens) quote-tweeted notorious neo-Nazi Sam Parker, who pointed out that Josh Hammer, who is Jewish and was a friend of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s, elevated a Trump tweet from 2013 the day before, which called for public executions. Candace (Candace Owens), of course, would like people to believe that Josh's quote-tweet is suspicious in the context of the assassination of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). But Josh was just sharing what many conservatives were sharing and stating the day before. ^t-00-07-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=496" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-08-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's because they were talking about the horrific murder of Irina Zarutska." This is where I say that no civilized nation uses the death penalty (in parentheses, referring to his own thoughts). Now, another user then jumped on that and tried to establish a non-fact that the footage of Irina's murder was released on that day, on the 9th, and that's why Josh tweeted that. All of this is factually untrue, okay? Irina was murdered on August 22nd. Her perpetrator was arrested that same day, and the footage was released and trended on X on September 5th. Josh himself sent multiple tweets regarding the homicide, as everyone did, because, like I said, it was trending. ^t-00-08-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=540" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-09-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And when he was asked specifically about punishment, criminality, perhaps that her perpetrator should face, Josh, at no point that I could determine—whether he was on the news, whether he was on his own show, or anywhere else—did he speak about the death penalty or, you know, a public execution. Instead, as you will see, and we will show you Josh in his own words, he spoke about the double standards surrounding the media coverage of her murder and really the topic of criminality more broadly and safety in America. Take a listen to what Josh said. (Clip of Josh Hammer:) ^t-00-09-00

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=575" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-09-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** You know, Gabrielle, I'm a lawyer by training, and I remember my first year of law school back in 2013 when I was taking criminal law. This is kind of the beginning of kind of the last kind of foray into so-called criminal justice reform. And even back then, there was a lot of chatter among my more liberal classmates about how, you know, incarceration and prisons lock you up. You know how all of this just racist is—kind of like it is an old kind of symbol of a white patriarchal, colonialist, imperial society there—and how the ultimate goal is basically to defund the prisons. And then, you know, if some people are going to commit some violent crimes, you know, essentially let the chips fall where they may. Well, you know, this is when the chips fall where they may. But most American people have not lost their minds. ^t-00-09-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=616" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-10-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** Most American people stand where Donald Trump stands, which is that they want basic, basic safety. I don't disagree that we all want basic safety. ^t-00-10-16

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=626" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-10-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I just don't hear him calling for the death penalty in those days that we're leading up. So I decided to do what I always do rather than say what he definitely meant or what he didn't mean. I decided to just create a micro timeline of Josh Hammer's tweets. And it gets pretty interesting on September 9th, the day before Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. This is what Josh Hammer tweeted. He tweeted a total of nine times on September 9th, and you can gather what was going on that day from his tweets. He wakes up at 7:30 a.m.—or rather pushes the first tweet at 7:30 a.m.—and he tweets about a viral Phillies crowd scandal. This is in Eastern Standard Time, by the way. ^t-00-10-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=665" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-11-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Right after that, he tweets a link—the one that I just showed you—to his media appearance about Irina Zarutska, where he does not call for the death penalty or anything close to the death penalty. 9:23 a.m., he tweets against Tucker (Tucker Carlson), because he has to do that at least twice a day, or I don't feel like he can get on with his day. 9:29 a.m., he tweets in favor of Israel and throws shade at Donald Trump and Qatar, and all of this is related to what went on on September 9th, which is that Israel bombed Qatar for no reason, violating international law, which they tend to do a lot. But he, of course, was in favor of what they were doing. ^t-00-11-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=701" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-11-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And so he throws shade at Donald Trump and Donald Trump's relationship with Qatar, because I guess it would be okay for them to violate international law if Donald Trump wasn't friends with Qatar or something. 11:33 a.m., he tweets against Saudi Arabia because they came out and made a statement against what Israel had done. So he tweets against Saudi Arabia. And then at 3 o'clock p.m., he tweets against Tucker (Tucker Carlson) for telling the truth about Israel and 9/11. Again, he has to do that a couple of times a day. It's part of his ritual. 5:58 p.m., he tweets about the Hebrew Bible being the basis of Western civilization alongside a speech that he had given—tweets a link out. ^t-00-11-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=738" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-12-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Again, promoting himself. 5:59 p.m., he tweets a promotion of his media appearance regarding a Supreme Court decision. And then there's this three-hour break. He puts his phone down, maybe. Maybe, maybe this is a three-hour break where he speaks to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I don't know, but I know that he speaks to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at night. And then at 9:09 p.m.—again, we're talking Eastern—and Josh Hammer tweets in favor of public execution, and there's no context that is provided. So anybody telling you he for sure meant this or he for sure didn't mean this is a liar. We cannot know that. We cannot know Josh Hammer's thoughts. A couple of things that I want to point out: Josh is not saying in that tweet that he's calling for the death penalty. ^t-00-12-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=783" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-13-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** People calling for the death penalty, debating the death penalty, is a very common political debate. It's a very common political talking point. It is absolutely not a typical or a regular political talking point or debate regarding public executions. We don't—we don't talk about that often. It's an exceedingly specific ask, right? Usually reserved to a visceral response to something that you have seen and in the moment, right? Matt Walsh—actually, we're prepping the show—I said I will guarantee you that when that footage got dropped, which was on September 5th, four days earlier, Matt Walsh would have tweeted this person should be publicly executed. And by the way, he did. He didn't. He said, "We can't keep living like this. ^t-00-13-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=825" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-13-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The only solution is ruthless punishment, public execution for violent criminals, long prison sentences, hard labor. This guy had multiple previous arrests. He should have already been serving 30 years in the labor camp. This is the only way, as our ancestors knew. We've tried compassion and restorative justice, and this is the result. It was inevitable." So Matt Walsh then went on his show and further explained that already contextualized tweet, and he explained how men have a visceral response when you see somebody being victimized—a woman being victimized in that way that Irina was. So we decided, for good measure, that we should check to see if maybe it was something regular that Josh Hammer also spoke about, which is public executions. ^t-00-13-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=869" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-14-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I can tell you that it is not something that Josh Hammer regularly tweets about or discusses. The first time that he tweeted about a public execution was back in 2013. And he said it in reference—I'm sorry, in 2022—and he said it in reference to the Boston Marathon bombing terrorist account. Oh sorry, the Uvalde shooter. "The Uvalde shooter is apparently dead, but just as with the Buffalo shooter, this level of pure evil would have been another ideal time for a public execution." So to be clear, that makes sense, right? ^t-00-14-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=907" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-15-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He is in the moment, and he is saying, "I'm having a visceral reaction to the idea of another school being shot up, having another school shooting. And for that reason, I am saying that this would have been an appropriate scenario for a public execution." Emotions are running high. You are visceral, and you're learning things. You're seeing and you're learning those things in the moment. As I said, that would make sense in its context. I also want to remind you that Josh Hammer is a lawyer by training. He was at one point the editor-at-large of the Daily Wire, and he is currently the senior editor-at-large at Newsweek. Plus he hosts his own show. ^t-00-15-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=951" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-15-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** My point that I'm making here is he knows how to communicate, okay? This is not some random guy on Twitter who doesn't know that if you haven't tweeted all day about something, you can't just throw out tweets about public executions without contextualizing them, right? He certainly understands you don't just send out a standalone tweet at nine o'clock p.m., and everyone's just gonna go, "What are you referring to?" He knows the public is not going to comprehend what he means outside of him providing some further context. And I will also add here that it is not particularly helpful that Josh Hammer as an individual is obsessively angry. He is an incredibly angry little man. You can read through his tweets. He has openly expressed bigoted and prejudiced opinions against white people. ^t-00-15-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=996" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-16-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He does not view himself to be a white person. He views himself to be a separate race: Jewish. That is a fact. And it wasn't a long time ago. We don't have to go back to 2013 to hear his ideas on that. Here was a tweet from him in 2019 that he then erased regarding white people. Here's what he said: "Jew hatred is inherent in the European DNA." Okay? Just like it's inherent. If you're white, you're inherently guilty. You're inherently an anti-Semite. You're born this way. It's just in your DNA. It's credible that he said that. ^t-00-16-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=1037" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-17-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And in response, we were told that he meant it metaphorically. Which kind of metaphor? Can you run that tweet again? I do know a little bit about metaphors and similes. "Jew hatred is inherent in European DNA." How's that for a metaphor, guys, for you? Because I thought metaphor might be "fire hair" to describe somebody who's red-headed. Oh, no, it's not literally fire. It's fire, fire red. No, I don't think a metaphor would be saying explicitly and literally that hating Jews is inherent inside of white people. ^t-00-17-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=1081" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-18-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I think it's amazing that he's even allowed—like there's just no consequence. It's like, yeah, well, editor-at-large at Newsweek. What are you gonna do? Eh, it's fine. You can hate white people. We all know that. It's fine, totally fine. Anyways, that's what he thinks about you guys. Full stop. And people are maybe perhaps because of that—because of how he regularly treats people and how he regularly attacks people and how vicious he is—are not feeling particularly charitable towards him, especially having been exposed as somebody who lied so audaciously and boldly and repeatedly and unnecessarily about the pressure that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was under—pressure which Josh Hammer was a part of applying in the weeks and then in the hours leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s death. ^t-00-18-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Riv3I7D0Yk&t=1124" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-2Riv3I7D0Yk/t-00-18-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Saddens me that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was stressed and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was worried, and that the very people that were stressing him out and making him have that sense of anxiety and worry then eulogized him and lied about all that. Why lie? That's the part that the public does not understand. How can we then trust a person that lies in that way? The natural thing is for us to then wonder what else is Josh lying about? Would we trust if Josh came out and said that tweet was definitely about Irina (Irina Zarutska)? Other people pull Donald Trump tweets. Some did pull that very tweet and called for a public execution. Would you trust Josh if he came out and said, "I know I didn't contextualize it, and I know all day I was tweeting about Israel, but that one was about Irina (Irina Zarutska)." ^t-00-18-44

He bragged that he and Rabbi Wolicki had a Zoom call with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Why? Because they said Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wanted them to help him with his talking points about Israel. Now, I have to say, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was one of the most skilled debaters ever—like literally ever. Any person that I have seen actually debating on stage, I learned my debate cues from Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-19-30

But let's be real. I have no proof to the contrary because I wasn't on the Zoom call. And Josh made it clear multiple times that in his last conversation with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), Charlie (Charlie Kirk), above anything else, was really interested in Josh's book. So much so that in his literal first tweet after news broke that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had in fact died, Josh manages to bring up his book. I'm not kidding. Here's his tweet. He writes this: "I am speechless, devastated, and heartbroken. We spoke less than 24 hours ago. ^t-00-20-11

And as you saw yesterday, Josh never forgets to plug his book. He never once forgot to plug his book. A few days after Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s death, he went on JTV—which is on the global Jewish channel—to discuss that call, that last call with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), further with a host named Ollie. And here is what Josh says about his book. (Clip of Josh Hammer:) ^t-00-20-54

And we were kind of talking him through talking points and strategy and how to deal with these expected hostile questions. And you held on my book, Israel and Civilization, Ali. The last words I think Charlie (Charlie Kirk) spoke to me were— he literally said, 'You know, Josh, you know, when the Israel question comes up, I'm just going to plug your book, you know, Israel and Civilization, because I think that what you write in the book basically is how I feel as well.'"

Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was just on the phone looking for talking points, trying to navigate some choppy waters with how he was going to address these kids that had some questions about Israel. He was unflinching, but he gratefully had Josh Hammer's book and wanted to go through it and make sure that he remembered everything. This is probably also a great time—referring to that little conference call they had, whatever, a Zoom call—to tell you that that rabbi, Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, was also on the now infamous text chain.

Do you think that guy who's fighting a 140,000-front war—because he keeps picking fights and pretending he's a victim—really just has time to pick up the phone and shoot the breeze with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), whose number, according to the released letter, he didn't even have in May? So what's he calling him about? They obviously weren't close if he didn't have his number, okay? So what's he calling Charlie (Charlie Kirk) about?

He doesn't lie as audaciously and as repeatedly and tweet nearly as neurotically as Josh Hammer does, but I want you to listen to what he had to say when asked whether or not Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was turning on Israel.

Now, you spoke to him just hours before his death. Did you feel that that was the case, that he was in fact turning on Israel?" "Lidar, I was in touch with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on an almost daily basis for months, and he certainly had some disagreements with Israeli policy, and he criticized Israel where he felt appropriate. He sometimes believed things like a lot of people do that are out there in the media, and that was really the substance of our relationship: was checking on things and finding out the truth. ^t-00-29-05

But the real answer to your question is the meeting that I had with him, and the entire purpose of the meeting—called by Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) called this meeting, and it was on our schedule for weeks, and was that he was going out on a campus tour. Utah was the first stop on his new campus tour. And what a lot of people in Israel do not realize—or in the pro-Israel community do not realize—is that between 40 and 50 percent of all of the questions and challenges that he would get on these campus tours were usually about Israel, ^t-00-29-48

So he ended up being in a position where he was defending Israel all the time, and it drove him crazy because he wanted to talk about America. But he was defending Israel all the time. So in preparation for this new campus tour, he called a meeting of a few people that he trusted to talk about Israel issues and to anticipate the questions that he would be getting, the challenges that he would be getting on this campus tour, and to make sure that he had the truth and that he could formulate answers that he was comfortable with. If Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had turned on Israel, why would he even bother with a meeting like that? ^t-00-30-33

If he was turning on Israel, he would have had Candace (Candace Owens) and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) in the meeting planning to throw Israel under the bus. The entire premise of the meeting refutes that theory." ^t-00-31-11

Now that you know that Rabbi Pesach Wolicki actually mentioned both Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and Candace (Candace Owens) 48 hours earlier as they were trying to do what they always do, which is control who he is allowed to speak to, control who I was allowed to speak to back when I was within the Zionist movement and waking up and realizing something was dangerously wrong when they started to try to control my voice. It's unbelievable. It's really unbelievable to reflect on that. Now, I would say again, Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, more of a soul. He's at least acknowledging that something was going on, right? I don't think he would have been comfortable pulling the jaw. "She was great. It was amazing by my book, right? He loved every second. He's amazing. Oh my God."

He just wanted to go fight for Israel. That's kind of the vibes that they were trying to put out there. At least Rabbi Pesach Wolicki is like, he was under some pressure, okay? He's saying it softly, but he's like, he was kind of needing to have a conversation to say he's not comfortable answering these questions anymore because it doesn't feel this way anymore. He realizes something is wrong. I told you he was particularly worried that Israel was infringing upon speech in America. I have text messages to that effect.

There was nothing—there was not payment that was coming in. Was I ignorant? Yes. I've owned that a thousand times. I thought it's not relevant topic, and it seems makes sense.

And yet they want us to believe that less than 48 hours before he died, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) announces that he has no choice but to abandon the pro-Israel cause because of Jewish donors and their behavior—living up to these stereotypes.

I've never said that because on the basis of the facts that you guys are following on the show, I don't have any evidence of that. It doesn't serve me to make up an area that I can't prove, right? Why would I say that? But what I will say is that I am uncomfortable with how many lies people that support Israel have been telling in the wake of his death. ^t-00-36-16

Like Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu, the propaganda, the lies, the coming after Candace (Candace Owens). None of this was necessary. Nobody thought, when this first happened, "This is 100% Israel." 100%, it's happened in Mormon country. How come there were no Mormon people, no Mormon presidents coming out and saying, "I just want to be clear that we didn't kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk)" 24 hours after he died? 'Cause that's what Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) did. How come there were no Mormon people that started Operation Mormon Pastor or President, feeling the need to baselessly attack me? I was actually on the Mormons. ^t-00-36-55

Mormons were not offended by that at all. Because they want to know if somebody is corrupt and had something to do with this. They want to know if their church was involved in this. That's a normal response: not to say it definitely wasn't us, but rather to say, "I'm on this journey. I want to know who killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk) too, and I'm therefore going to support Candace (Candace Owens)'s efforts to find out." Exact opposite of what Israel is doing, right? That is the one disturbing fact about people that support Israel: their behavior, to put it in a way that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) put it.

Riverbend Ranch has taken the Black Angus beef to a whole new level. Over the last 35 years, the ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones and without antibiotics, and every fall the calves containing these all-genetics were turned to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. ^t-00-38-23

It's born in the USA, it's raised in the USA, and it's processed in the USA. Their meat is aged to perfection for 21 days, shipped directly from the ranch to your home. This is not your average black Angus beef. It's more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef that I've ever tasted.

Using Comet feels a bit like having a personal assistant living in your web browser that can actually do things for you across the web—doing things literally, not just giving you answers. You can ask Comet to do things, and it can click, type, search, scroll for you. And what I love most about Comet is that it can take weeknight chaos and turn it into something more simplified and stress-free, like planning a dinner. With just a few taps, you can get a personalized meal plan that's based on your family's preferences. Comet orders the groceries for me, and it gets them delivered right to the door.

I just wanna see footage of men that have their long hair—enough hair that it's up in a ponytail or a bun. There is of course a specific reason why I'm asking for that. Also there— in me scouring the earth for every piece of footage, there's an almost incomprehensible lack of footage that is coming from the left side of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), meaning if Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is facing the crowd, it would be his left side. ^t-00-42-37

They are amazing people that work at Turning Point USA—the overwhelming majority of them. And that's what sucks when corporate people at the top take a direction; those people get no say, right? This investigation is being assisted by Turning Point USA—not the execs, but Turning Point people on the ground, people that they don't even think about, smaller employees—like they deeply care about what has happened. They deeply care about finding answers regarding what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And so we never want to paint a broad picture that this is Turning Point. ^t-00-44-47

If the truth is capable of destroying your company—the truth—then does your company deserve to exist? If I'm like, "If people learn the truth about how Candace (Candace Owens) treats her employees, Candace (Candace Owens) isn't gonna have a career." If people learn the truth about what Candace (Candace Owens) does in the weekends, it will destroy her career. Like that probably means that you're not a good person or you're not a good company if the truth is a threat to you. I've heard this argument over and over. ^t-00-45-30

Do I make mistakes? Yes. I own my mistakes immediately. And I will be very quick to apologize to people when I get things wrong. But I'm not an evil person—nowhere near an evil person. And I always try to be honest. And so do not concern yourselves with people that feel threatened by truth, right? That's ridiculous.

Why is she saying this? Is this the right time? It's actually getting quite boring, I think. It's a little boring. I would almost describe their strategy as blitzkrieg.

Very convincing, by the way. He sent out a tweet to convince people they shouldn't watch me, he said. "I can't comment on Candace (Candace Owens) because it's quite obviously a freak show. It's like driving on the highway and seeing a farmer having sex with a sheep. You don't want to look, but you can't look away either. The problems begin when you try to analyze it. It is what it is."

So if that's kind of what you're selling—you know how like when you can't look away from bestiality? Dinesh, you wanna know your opinion on me? Not what's on your laptop and how they maybe blackmailed you, okay? That's not what we're interested in, Dinesh D'Souza. And he's like, "Well, I meant that as a joke." You didn't mean it as a joke. You went in seriously, and it was weird. It got weird very quickly. And we learned more about you than we learned about me. That seems to be the circumstance.

So I would say—I think Dinesh D'Souza—if you thought that that was gonna be relatable and convince people—"Yeah, I totally relate. Yeah, it's like you just can't look away from that stuff when you see it." That did not happen. That did not happen. Now, because they are seriously increasing and being—I would almost say—erratic in their behavior, obsessive, erratic, neurotic, there is a real risk here, right? ^t-00-49-08

And they never told us who specifically told them that, by the way. Now I'm wondering why they never told us who specifically told them that. I called Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I'm like, "I'm hearing—are you hearing me saying anything? I'm hearing that they're saying that we're next." And now I go, was that supposed to be a threat to me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to have us watch the public execution of a friend of ours and then to call us and to say, "You should lay low for a little bit because you guys were hearing that you guys are on a list." ^t-00-49-47

And David—Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot. This really happened. And I'm coming out of the grief stage and realizing I think that was an element of this: to send a signal to shoot him in the throat, right?

It indoctrinates you into their matrix. What I wanted to do—as I discussed yesterday and which got picked up—was to create a kill switch, right? To realize that Kanye was kind of right. Never too late to say that Kanye was right. Kanye said that in order to be free, you had to violate these contracts. You had to recognize that your voice is being controlled.

And Drew, I feel that, and I think it's important to share that information as Kanye sent me all the messages of people who were threatening him. I have them all—to information share with Max Blumenthal, with people. I mean, people all over the place—to send a package and say, "If anything happens to me and it looks suspicious, release it all." It's not even about having an opposite and equal reaction.

Man's a champion. But the point is, is that this is a real dead man's switch. She has sent out to the Tate brothers, Dave Smith, Max Blumenthal, Tucker (Tucker Carlson), and others. Well, I'm trying to get her on for weeks. I'm a little bummed out she didn't send it to me, because I'd like to stand with her, but we do stand with her. So they're already out saying she's a liar. She's going to release that. Now, this doesn't prove Israel killed him or a lobby around that, because I've seen no evidence. You know, they said in security detail it was Israeli. They weren't. ^t-00-55-04

I said you can certainly say Israel's a suspect, but I said, 'I need to see proof. We need to figure out the ballistics and who really shot him and all that before we then, you know, start saying, okay, you know, motive.' I mean, you can always look at motive, but first with the forensic situation: are they covering it up? What's the ballistics? That's just where I am. I'm not gonna just say something because people think it. But when she releases this, she's got it. Make no mistake. Just like she keeps bringing the goods. And she just sets the hook with the worm on it or puts the mousetrap out with the cheese on it. And they come out and say, 'You're a liar.' And she goes, 'Boom.' 'You're a liar.' Boom.

It's coming out.' And the word is he specifically thought Israel was going to kill him." Even Michael Savage first—a few months ago—said, "Netanyahu needs to go on my show." During the break he goes, "Man, I hope Mossad doesn't kill me." Cruz saw it; it was on the feed. He didn't say it was off-record. It was during the break. So there are a lot of groups that want Charlie (Charlie Kirk) killed. He was defeating the Democrats with TPUSA. ^t-00-56-35

So I see them as the motive, and they said we want Charlie (Charlie Kirk) dead. They said they celebrated when he was dead. He had like six trantifa say, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) be dead tomorrow." Then they said, "See, we told you." And that was in the town. So, you know, we got trantifa—the tranny Antifa—running around, engaged in all sorts of violence everywhere.

And it's really just been this insane behavior of covering up and lying that makes us question things. Like that's the reality. And by the way, questioning things doesn't mean that we have any proof that that happened, which is why we've been actually reticent to say that. But they're not acting right. And gut means something. They're not acting right. None of them are acting right. And that's not just Turning Point USA execs. And I've tried to explain it away in my head a thousand times.

But what you're seeing is the stranglehold of AIPAC. It is a political organization. And I always say if you look at any lobby in D.C., it'll make you hate someone, right? Pharmaceutical lobby will make you hate the pharmaceutical companies. The Jewish lobby will make you hate Jews. The black caucus will make you hate black people. And so people that go to D.C. are incredibly corrupt. Money rules them, and they become powerful. Power corrupts. Absolutely. It's just good to remember that. ^t-00-59-21

It's funny, and it's good to remind yourself that politics is serious all the time, but most of the people do not behave like psychopaths, and they're very funny and can make fun of themselves. Uh, are going to read a couple sponsors before I get to you guys' comments. We're going to tell you first of all about Home Title Lock because if you are a homeowner, need to listen to this. The FBI has been warning homeowners about a type of real estate fraud on the rise, which is title theft. This type of theft doesn't happen by breaking down your doors and stealing your stuff. It happens with just a one-page document, a forged signature, and it gets filed to the county. And if your title—which is a legal record of your ownership—gets transferred out of your name, criminals can use your ownership to drain your equity or even sell your property. And you won't even know about it until you start getting collection notices or foreclosure notices in the mail. ^t-01-01-42

You can use my promo code CANDACE at HomeTitleLock.com, and you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock protection. That's 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes, and if fraud occurs, their U.S.-based restoration team will spend up to $1 million to fix it. Again, HomeTitleLock.com, promo code CANDACE. I also want to tell you guys about American Financing because the cost of everything is still out of control. Many people are relying on credit cards to cover essentials. If that debt is piling up, you should know you're not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing, but maybe hesitated because you didn't want to give up your low mortgage rate. ^t-01-02-26

Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment. It'll give you peace of mind. The loan will allow you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing loan mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started with no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now.

But that transition is tough on our skin sometimes. The end of the summer sun, the new autumn wind can leave us feeling tired, dry, dull.

They always say, "There's a Trump tweet for everything," and then people will pass it around for certain situations. Do you think that that is what he was doing in the context of what was going on that day, which was really the focus of his tweets seemed to be talking about Israel—as always—and going after Qatar and Tucker (Tucker Carlson), as always. What are you guys thinking? Corey Henry, thank you for that donation. "Hey, sister from another mother, hire more security. I fear for you now. Please stay safe. Prayers for you and yours.

He actually outright purchased a security company, and it didn't matter. And they didn't do anything. It clearly was an act of vanity. They should never be allowed to work again because why would you not have—I mean, he's a sitting duck. The amount that he was paying for that security for them to not check rooftops. You could have someone actually requiring that you have access to rooftops. You could have one of your guys on a rooftop. Wouldn't that be a good idea? I don't know. I just—I don't understand it. Kelly Gibbs writes, "My Catholic bestie and I keep you in our prayers." Thank you, Kelly, for this gift. "Rosary and divine mercy.

"I'm not associated with Turning Point USA, and I'm not a liberal. Please don't tear apart Turning Point USA because we need a movement for the youth. Please tread lightly. Make sure you have all the facts because you are an important voice." Any youth movement must be based in truth. And like I said, Turning Point USA has fantastic people that worked and signed up to work for that company and dedicated their time with that company—whether even volunteers, people on college campuses—because they believed in truth, and they knew they were getting it from Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Right now, we're at a point. ^t-01-06-41

And to the extent that they do that, fantastic. They will have an ally in me. I never attacked Turning Point USA because it came from Turning Point USA. And I saw what it took to build that company because I was a part of building that company. But to the extent that we feel that they've become so corporate that they're not answering our questions or making us feel ashamed for asking these questions or just like feeling like they don't care about getting to truth— I think it was very sloppy what Tyler Bowyer did on X. He was accusatory; he called people names. To that extent, they won't survive. That is just a reality. I can't fix that, right? ^t-01-07-18

They will pick up on what feels like treachery. It will feel to them like a betrayal to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s legacy. 'Cause that's how it feels to me, right? We're all feeling it together. That's the point. And so we offer this as a course correction for them. You know, I want to believe that they're just grieving in a weird way, that they have a ton of things on their plates. Maybe they're fearful for their own lives. I don't know. But if that were the truth, they could still get the truth out to other people. And that is something I want you to know that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was remarkable at. And that's why I always say spend a Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Never took the bait on people saying, "He's this; he's this." Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was very good at knowing he's the guy they'll get in the room. He was happy to schmooze.

I mean, he was—as someone put it today—he was a maestro. He really was. He's like, "That's the drum, you know, so we're going to need the bass. You're going to need to be the strings. I'm going to play this, and we are—we're going to have a symphony." They're not working with the fighters. It feels like they're working with the feds. They've said explicitly they're working with the feds. So I don't know what to make of that, but I hear you. I hear you, and I feel the same way.

I don't know. I say something; she gets beat. It's weird. But during that course of that, Constantina kissed him when he was like, "You need to make a statement against Candace (Candace Owens) and Tucker (Tucker Carlson)." Somebody else was saying to her, "Candace (Candace Owens) doesn't even hate the left anymore." Like that was supposed to be a convincing argument for Megyn to trash me. Like really trying to get us to exist in that left-right paradigm, and it only serves them at the top. So I hope more of this—more realizing and more coming together on the stuff that we can agree on. Miracle Media lastly writes: "Candace (Candace Owens), as a Christian, you have the authority to fight any strife that comes your way. ^t-01-12-59

They are protection scriptures." Thank you so much for saying that, and we pray every day. We really do. But everything is in God's control. And we—I feel—are in a great period of revelation. And that is why we are also in a period of anxiety because with that, you know, the demons commit further to their demonology, and we therefore have to commit more to truth. And yeah, that's basically all that I want to say today. You guys, I have some bad news here at the very end. I am going to take next week off. I'm going to take about 10 days off, actually. ^t-01-13-38

You know, I just feel like I need to—I'm arriving at the acceptance phase. I will say the stages of grief is very real. And I just kind of want to take a little bit of time to really just kind of mourn Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in my own personal capacity and just kind of recognize I'm never going to see him again, never talk to him again— to say kind of bye in my own way and take a break and a breather. And so nothing bad is happening to me. I will still be sending an occasional Instagram wave so that you guys know that I'm fine. But I wanted to let you know a heads up what's going on there. Anyways, if you would like to support our show—as many of you guys have—you can head to CandaceOwens.com. You can sign up; you can join our book club. You can buy our—we don't know, no, but we know—brand stuff. ^t-01-14-20

And it's a parody because we don't want to be in the CIA. We think there's a lot of corruption there. Actually, I'm hoping one day my team will let me have the green hat. They never sent it to me. So hopefully if you know someone—somebody get me that green CIA hat because it's actually—people are tagging me in, and I don't have it. And it's really nice. Other than that, you guys, thank you so much for your support, and we'll see you tomorrow. ^t-01-15-04
