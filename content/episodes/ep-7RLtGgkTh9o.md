Happy Friday. And I'm just gonna jump right in and tell you that somehow all of my investigations are converging. Like literally all of them that we've done on this show, and I'm freaking out. I would have never thought in a million years that there would be something that connected the Chaos book—which I got obsessed with and [that] it's required reading for this podcast— connected to the Brigitte Macron case. I'm gonna tell you about that, connected to Ye (Kanye West), me telling you all about what happened behind the scenes when he was effectively kicked out of Hollywood, and the reason why I refused to publicly condemn him despite insistence from the brood of vipers. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=44" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-00-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I don't know how it's possible, but Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination is pulling in all of these elements. And we need to speak a lot more about the Calvary Chapel and also Britney Spears. Britney Spears—suddenly Britney Spears is here. Britney Spears and everything that happened to her is now increasingly relevant. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=81" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-01-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I don't know how much more I can impress upon you all that we have to steel ourselves against psychological operations. It is all about psychology. That is the name of the game. We are living inside of one big psychological operation. I am convinced. I've seen enough. There's just no other way to present that information. It's a fact. Now that everything is fake and gay—and dangerously so? I was freaking out realizing that quite literally all of our investigations over the past two years were coming together here. Brigitte Macron—where did we end up, by the way? Where did we leave off on Brigitte Macron? I was speaking to you guys about MKUltra. ^t-00-01-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=123" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-02-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** How odd it was that of everything I said in my series, Brigitte Macron and Emmanuel had a heart attack when I started discussing MKUltra. They brought it up 18 times in the lawsuit against me—way too many times in the lawsuit against me. And I realized we were on the right path discussing this. It brought me back to that road. It brought me back to the Haight-Ashbury Clinic. We're gonna talk about that and the program that they're running throughout California. Ye (Kanye West). When I said why I didn't speak out was because I recognized that he had done something tremendously brave, and that he—the entire mob mafia—descended on him. It was a psychological operation. They put him on a psych 5150 hold, which is one of their strategies. ^t-00-02-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=168" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-02-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And effectively, he had been MKUltra'd, right? By putting on that psych 5150 hold. Jeffrey Epstein. I did a mini-series on Jeffrey Epstein. We spoke about the blackmail. We spoke about the trafficking through big companies because nobody blinks an eye. If it's a modeling agency, nobody blinks an eye. As he was—he was funding tons of mechanisms, particularly models and movies. Harvey Weinstein connection. I spoke with him. It was very weird that they took out Harvey Weinstein. That is a fact—via the MeToo movement. And I had posited to ^t-00-02-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=210" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-03-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And of course, as we've been discussing on the show, Zionist Inc. Everybody understands what Zionist Inc. is now. You see it everywhere. You cannot question Israel at all, or they descend on you. Somehow, the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk assassination is bringing together every single last one of these themes that we have been exploring. So, where did we leave off yesterday? Well, we spoke about the Calvary Chapel. We spoke about Rob McCoy being the lead pastor in Thousand Oaks—one of their many churches across the United States—and my sense... which every Christian Zionist influencer under the sun is trying to ward me off of. Well, how dare she? This is—I can't even believe it. Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) can blow up thousands and tens of thousands of kids, but Candace (Candace Owens) investigating the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk assassination is crazy. ^t-00-03-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=254" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-04-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's unbiblical. It only furthered my sense that faith had somehow been infiltrated. Faith had become a military operation—or perhaps from the '60s onward, that's what it's always been, right? Too many instances—as I showed you yesterday—of trafficking and sexual abuse. You have to begin asking the question whether or not this is systemic and it's on purpose and who these pastors are working for. But I get an email yesterday which made me perk up—a flurry of emails, actually. Thank you guys—telling me to stay the course because the Calvary Chapel was also involved in Britney Spears' conservatorship. What? Excuse me. ^t-00-04-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=298" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-04-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now to be clear, I never got into the Britney Spears web. There were so many TikToks, so many people that did the research, dedicated their time to it. I just wasn't one of them. And I will therefore make it clear that I am not an expert on this case. I obviously could not have become an expert overnight. But after speaking with Ye (Kanye West) and being a part of that—being around him when everything went down—I got the gist of the fact that celebrities are very much controlled: what they can say, what they can't say, who they're allowed to date. And if they step one bit out of the carefully orchestrated narrative, something comes down on them and begins to control them in operation. I get the gist. ^t-00-04-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=339" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-05-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, so that we can have a little bit more of a gist—particularly who they were referencing—is Lou Taylor. Lou Taylor apparently was very much involved. That is what has been heavily insinuated—and even by Britney Spears herself. Got involved and pushed for this conservatorship. That is what has been alleged. I'm going to allow Brett Cooper—I'm just gonna rip this content from her show, hopefully she doesn't mind—to explain how Britney Spears was effectively infiltrated. Take a listen. (Brett Cooper clip) ^t-00-05-39

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=374" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-06-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** We need to understand a little more of Lou Taylor's history. So Lou Taylor became involved with Britney Spears in 2007 after she was hired to help manage Jamie Lynn Spears. And this was right around the time that Jamie got pregnant. Now, somehow—no one really knows. I mean, this is not documented at all. She was brought into the fold of this family by their father, Jamie. This is Jamie Senior. And by 2008—so less than a year later—Lou was going on TV shows as the family's spokesperson to speak on behalf of Britney. Lou Taylor is the business manager for Britney Spears' father, mother, and younger sister, Jamie Lynn. Lou, good morning to you. ^t-00-06-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=406" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-06-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Here you have Britney that needs to have some security somewhere that every single thing she does and every single person she has a relationship with doesn't become an opportunity to be exploited. I mean, when do you ever rest in that if you're constantly in fear of being exploited? Every day, Jamie goes to work as a professional chef, asking the Lord to give him the strength to honor the people he works for in the midst of circumstances. Lynn Spears is a mother that is brokenhearted just because she's apart from her daughter, that she loves her daughter so much, and again, asking every day for God to give her strength and for her to continue to have hope. ^t-00-06-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=446" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-07-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** And her mom stated in her memoir, Through the Storm, that Lou and Britney's father had discussed putting her in a conservatorship shortly after that happened. So this was all around 2008. But the missing piece here—and guys, this is what shocked me—is that Jamie Senior had around this time allegedly filed for bankruptcy. He had done this multiple times, and Lou Taylor's firm gave Britney's dad a loan of $40,000. Now, we don't know why, but he had just filed for bankruptcy, and this woman gave him $40,000. Now, within months of this loan, the conservatorship of Britney Spears was implemented. This was in February of 2008. But Lou and her father—even though Britney was apparently not able to function, she needed to be under this conservatorship—they kept her career going. Listen to this. Only months after arguing that his daughter was incapacitated and therefore needed to be under his control, ^t-00-07-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=491" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-08-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Mr. Spears committed her to an eight-month tour named Circus. Tristar—that is Lou Taylor's company—was hired to serve as the tour's business manager, handling its finances and accounting, and the tour grossed an estimated $130 million—money that was now under the control of Lou Taylor and Jamie Spears, the father. So she was mentally ill, but not mentally ill enough to prevent her from making them more money and allowing them to control their money. So what we're describing here is effectively an infiltration. And instantly, Lou Taylor talking about God and prayers—that's a lot of what you start to see. ^t-00-08-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=527" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-08-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** And then when you look beneath that layer, you start to go, okay. You start to ask questions. Then suddenly the God people get upset, okay? ^t-00-08-47

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=536" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-08-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** What she's describing there is effectively an infiltration, but it's gonna get crazier. And I want you to hold on to that idea of an infiltration because also yesterday after I covered Rob McCoy's Potter's Field scandal—the one that happened up in Montana where I described to you an organization, faith-based organization, and I told you that then suddenly people were wondering what's happening with the finances, didn't know where the money was going. Rob McCoy steps in as the CFO, and there's articles about it, and essentially this organization sort of disappears overnight. Well, someone who was involved intimately—intimately—with this scandal messaged me and said, "Candace, no, you have it completely wrong because you're reading what's in the press." ^t-00-08-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=578" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-09-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The Potter's Field scandal—Potter's Field was actually a healthy, functional organization. This was actually a Christian ministry until—and again, I'm going to say this is alleged, but I'm looking further into this claim—until Rob McCoy got involved and then he intentionally scandalized it and staged an effective hostile takeover with a few other board members. That's what this person is alleging, and they've sent emails and some backup proof, which we need to go through before we can present that as a fact. But it piqued my interest. The idea of a hostile takeover designed as faith-based—almost, right? Like we're doing the right thing here and we're trying to help. ^t-00-09-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=620" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-10-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Let's stay the course of this idea of companies, people, and organizations being taken over via scandals. Because the people who seem to get involved don't exactly have the qualifications to be in the C-suite or to be the heads of companies at all. And as Brett Cooper is about to lay out, Lou Taylor's qualifications are somewhat lacking. Take it away again, Brett Cooper. (Brett Cooper clip) ^t-00-10-20

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=643" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-10-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Now another thing that I think is important to understand about Lou Taylor is that Lou is not a talent manager. She's not here to just oversee brands or help deals be made. She's not like an agent or that kind of thing. She was playing the role of business manager, which is a financial role. Even though Lou Taylor had no financial background—she was not even an accountant. And most business managers—my business manager—is an accountant. Lou Taylor actually started her career in a church working alongside her husband, who at the time was a pastor at Calvary Chapel in Brentwood, California. And interestingly enough, according to financial documents that are in the public domain, Jamie Sr. was giving 10% of his income that he was making off of Britney Spears from the conservatorship to the church where Lou Taylor's husband was a pastor. ^t-00-10-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=688" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-11-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Read this. Mr. Spears at times gave 10% of his conservatorship income to the Taylors' Calvary Chapel Brentwood—a practice known as tithing—according to a 2010 financial document. Mr. Spears gave tens of thousands of dollars in one year alone to the church, which is about 500 miles away from where he lives in Louisiana. Now obviously since then, all of this information has come out, and Britney has now accused Lou of playing a major role in her exploitation. And even though Lou denies all of this and continues to deny everything through emails obtained through Britney's trials, it is clear that in some way, Lou was involved. This is from the LA Times. Britney Spears' lawyer emails show ex-business manager helped set up conservatorship. ^t-00-11-28

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=726" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-12-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** And in recent years, Britney has even gone so far as to accuse her father and Lou of allegedly having an affair and unlawfully using her money to fund trips of their own. This headline from Daily Mail reads, and claims he charged her estate for the pair's trip to the Holy Land to get baptized. And guys, this is not Lou's only controversy. She is not just wrapped up in the Britney Spears world. Just a couple of years ago, the New Yorker reported that she also tried to place Courtney Love and Lindsay Lohan into conservatorships. ^t-00-12-06

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=758" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-12-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Oh, we're going to get there because as I started following the Calvary Chapel again—suddenly involved in that part that she's mentioning about the tithing. Since I put onto my Instagram stories that—what is this? You're telling me that this woman Lou Taylor also was involved in the Calvary Chapel? And I was not paying attention to anything that was going on with Britney Spears at all. And I've arrived at this same conclusion that there's some sort of an infiltration that seems to be happening with Calvary Chapels. And here's where we are. That's ridiculous. This can't be a coincidence. There can't be this many people that are having this experience and have this much scandal involving this church. This doesn't make sense to me. ^t-00-12-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=793" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-13-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Well, I put this up on my stories this morning, and two other people reached out to me who worked with Lou Taylor and described exactly what she's referring to—this system of tithing that Lou Taylor makes them say 10% has to go to the church if they want to be blessed. I'm not kidding. 10% has to go to the church if they want God to bless them. This is why they should do this. And then also directing them to invest in other companies without necessarily revealing that they're involved in those other companies and that God will bless them and they'll pray over them. What is happening? How can there be this many Calvary Chapel scandals and stories? She also mentioned Lindsay Lohan. She's not lying there. ^t-00-13-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=833" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-13-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Well-loved teenager, fantastic actress—who didn't love a Parent Trap when they were growing up—and then somehow became addicted to drugs. Suddenly her dad, Michael Lohan—you might not remember this, but he got in front of a mic speaking to the press and called out Lou Taylor. Take a listen. (Michael Lohan clip) ^t-00-13-53

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=852" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-14-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** When Lindsay was supposed to go into Morningstar rehab, they started to reconstruct everything there for Lindsay to accommodate her. Sean "Chapman" Holly, Sean and Lou Taylor leaked that to the press because they wanted Lindsay to get out sooner and have her in UCLA so she wouldn't spend much time in the rehab. They're destroying my daughter's life. I'm praying that Dina finally—finally—gets on the same page with me and does something about this. ^t-00-14-12

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=880" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-14-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, Skylar, do we have the email, by the way—before I even get into what Courtney Love told me? Do we have the email somebody sent me? And guys, just—you know—I blacked out a ton of this email because it's way too identifying. And this sounds like a very scary syndicate, in my opinion, so I don't want to put anybody at risk. But somebody who very much knew Lou Taylor—worked with Lou Taylor—sent me this, which is interesting. Again, the whole top is blacked out. It says, "I have since come to think that Rob and Lou Taylor's church is just a front for them and a ruse." "I actually have many suspicions about at least Lou being tied to possibly the CIA and Mossad." "All of the security that was hired under the name of—" she's writing "black box"; she means Black Cube security. ^t-00-14-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=924" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-15-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "That was also the security that was provided for Harvey Weinstein, where it's really just the Mossad agents who now are mostly with the Kardashians." Now we're gonna talk about Ye (Kanye West) in a bit. "I did go to Israel with Rob Taylor and a few other people from our church in [blank] and know that they have many ties there." "I've also heard that Lou has connections and ties to Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein, et cetera." I'm going to say all of this is alleged—obviously this is an email tip. I cannot—I have not confirmed any of that. The reporters trying to connect some of the dots—and they told me at the house that Britney was being held out in 2019 was tied to Epstein somehow via Tony Blair. Britney Spears lives in Thousand Oaks, California—as does Justin Bieber. I believe P. Diddy, I believe, has a house there as well. ^t-00-15-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=967" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-16-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I know Lou Taylor built a house there and would find it very hard to believe that she does not know Rob McCoy—seeing that he was the mayor of Thousand Oaks and is the pastor of the large Calvary Chapel church there. Before Rob and Lou Taylor moved to Brentwood, Tennessee. I think Rob and Lou Taylor moved to Brentwood, Tennessee. They lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and attended a very large Calvary Chapel church there. And they were mentored by a man named Bob Coy. We brought him up yesterday—the pedophile scandal that we mentioned yesterday—who has since been embroiled in scandal for sexual allegations. And I believe had to step down. He mentored them in the process of starting their church in Brentwood, Tennessee. That's interesting. ^t-00-16-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=1009" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-16-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It would be foolish for us to think that Lou Taylor does not know Rob McCoy—exactly, right? All these people live in Thousand Oaks, California, and he's been pastoring that church up until July of this year for a very long time. And it's about to get even crazier because back in January of this year, someone notified me that Courtney Love wanted to reach out to me. So there you go. Brett Cooper has mentioned that Courtney Love has also had allegations about Lou Taylor. We all know who Courtney Love is. If for nothing else, it's because the media has convinced most people that she had something to do with the murder of her husband, Kurt Cobain, right? That's the reality, right? I didn't grow up with this music. ^t-00-16-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=1048" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-17-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I didn't listen to this music, but I know the Kurt Cobain story, and I know that somewhere in the back of my mind, I was kind of conditioned to believe that she had something to do with his murder. It was never explicitly said, but there was enough innuendo to get us there. Anyway, when I made contact with her, it was because she had been watching my podcast, and she knew that I was obsessed with the book Chaos. It just—it just—my mind just exploded understanding how severe a psychological operation could be: the media being complicit, convincing us that murders happened. I ended the book and I said, "Did anybody die that night?" That is how wild of a journey it is—the same year, of course, as the moon landing—entire psychological operation. And you just go—what is real? What is not real? I don't know. ^t-00-17-28

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RLtGgkTh9o&t=1092" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o/t-00-18-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** If you have not read that book, you should read it. And I became even more obsessed with learning everything that I could about the '60s and the military-grade MKUltra program that our government employed in place after JFK was shot, right? Actually putting journalists on payroll to control our minds. If you are new here, you absolutely must read that book. You have to understand how this thing works. This is why I put together my book club—because it's so much that you just start to wonder what is real, what is fake. Are we actually living in a simulation? How could I have believed all these things about people on the basis of what I read in the media because they gave you some sort of an authority, right? They present themselves as some sort of authority, or they have expertise in this area that they fact-check. ^t-00-18-12

Courtney—at that time—Courtney Love told me so much information in January of this year. It was like—she basically wrote me a novel. I couldn't process it. It was information overload. And if she had sent that to anybody but me, someone would have looked at this information and said, "Oh, this is just crazy." "She's crazy—truly." "She's obviously insane" because people that are outside of the Hollywood matrix cannot grasp or comprehend what goes on inside of it. It's spiritually so offensive that we go, "There's no way all of this can be going on." And then you join my book club and you read Hollywood Babylon—you're like, "Oh, this is actually how the system was built in Hollywood." It was built off of this stuff. ^t-00-18-57

I saw it up close. And even I thought Ye (Kanye West) was crazy or like having—was being hysterical—when he turned around to me in my house and he said—when all that was going down and Adidas was canceling him, Gap was canceling him— he was like, "Are you an op, too?" "Are you an op, too?" I was like, "What on earth are you talking about?" Until I fully came to realize what he meant. It started with that book Chaos, and I've just done so much research since. Now I fully understand what he was saying when he was asking me that question if I was also an op, right? ^t-00-19-41

He was asking me—Ye (Kanye West)—"Are you a part of the psychological operation that is meant to control me?" "Are you one of these handlers that's meant to stop me from breaking out of this effective mental prison?" "I'm realizing something's wrong, and everyone's telling me there's something wrong with me when I'm saying, 'No, this is—there's something wrong with this,' right?" "Why are you trying to make me think I'm crazy?" And I'm going back to my own thing for tweeting that genocide is always wrong. The operatives are right. "Oh, don't you understand—see how that could have been antisemitic?" Right? So don't you understand? ^t-00-20-23

That is what he is referring to. Right? R-U-N-O-P. Courtney Love—this is in January and in February of this year. I have all of this in writing. Effectively, wrote explaining to me exactly how the operation functions and why. She explained to me that she was a toddler and she was experimented on at the Haight-Ashbury Clinic. For those of you—Haight-Ashbury—it's the intersection where they had this clinic and the hippies came. And this is when the CIA was just dosing them intentionally because they wanted to understand how to control minds. ^t-00-21-04

And they were experimenting on hippies when they did this. And Courtney—who is writing a book on this, so I'm not exposing anything—told me that she was given LSD at this age. This is how she grew up. She grew up in this area. And she told me, "I did not kill Kurt Cobain." That was a part of a psychological operation to make the masses look away from what the CIA was guilty of. And she then told me through a lot of messages that at the core of all of this is ownership.

And if they cannot control those individuals, they will stage some sort of a hostile takeover of that brand or of that company or of that particular person. And there's a number of ways that that can be accomplished. First and foremost, the psychosis— "Oh my, she's having a mental breakdown." "She needs a break." "She's really tired." "Britney's been put on a psych 5150 hold." "Ye (Kanye West), he said he was just reading a Bible, and Harley Pasternak—and we got into his backstory and MKUltra—suddenly puts him in a hospital on a psych 5150 hold." ^t-00-22-30

Also, of course, Wacko Jacko. The media gets involved in this—blaring out to the public: "Don't look at what's happening behind the scenes because this person is just absolutely crazy." They're doing this to me right now. Obviously, you guys see this every single day. "She's lost us." "She's gone off the deep end." Thank you. That's where I'd like to be. I don't want to be in the shallow end, my friends. Yeah, let's get deep on these topics. Another way that they accomplish this is via lawfare. They will bankrupt you, okay? This is why what's happening to Elijah Schaffer—this is relevant. This is one of their strategies. When they want you to shut up, they will effectively bankrupt you. Your consequence will be that you have no more money. ^t-00-23-14

He died broke, right? And the people who he was fighting owned his catalog. Actually in the news today—this is totally a God thing. I saw Paris Jackson was in the news today. She's lost in court, and she's still fighting over her father's legacy. It's insane. The very people he hated right now own his catalog, and he was beating them. And they lied to us about the pedophilia. I did a whole episode on that. You should look it up. Candace (Candace Owens), Michael Jackson.

The MeToo movement. That's what I was getting at. It was such an easy way to hostilely take over big companies because even if these people survive and prove they didn't do anything wrong to these women who may be paid to come up and say, "He did this" or "he did that," you effectively have to sell your company because you just can't—you're so tarred and feathered reputationally that nobody wants to work with you anymore, right? Who buys these companies? It doesn't matter. Like I said, by the end of the day, whether or not the allegations are true, it's how much damage they can do to you as a person. And of course, the last way that they can hostilely take over your company is with an untimely death. ^t-00-24-33

"Maybe Kendall because she's kind of real and has an SF90 that I could drive." "They actually have blood on their hands, and I know everything." Well, we're never gonna know what he knows because he then died in a very mysterious circumstance. This is People Magazine.

Anyways, going back to what Courtney Love told me—and I'm looking back at these messages and I'm mind-blown. She made it very clear—which to me, she intimated to me—that this is a mafia.

Curiously—and I'm going to read this to you or else you won't believe me—she kept insisting to me through many messages that I needed to look into the quote-unquote "Mormon mafia," which she said sits above Hollywood and even sits above many Zionist Jews. Now, I want to be very clear because this can be offensive to people. Every faith has been infiltrated. Okay, we know that things are corruptible.

And if you are actually a person that cares about your soul and you want to get into heaven, your job is not to defend corruption—whether it's happening in your church, in your backyard, in your own home. Your job is to try to root it out. And I'm sharing this text message because it's crazy that at the time that she sent it, I was like, "I don't know any of this." I'm not up on—she mentioned Lou Taylor. And I'm like, "What are you talking about?" So I'm going to read this to you. Okay. I just took a screenshot earlier today.

That actually is accurate. It looks like she owns or sat on the board of Churchome. I know you Bieber people—people that were doing the videos about that—know a lot. That seemed to be accurate and made no sense to me at the time because I'm not hip. I don't follow a lot of the Hollywood stuff. Then she says, "Christian non-denominational, but she's LDS."

And now, of course, we learn that this church that Lou Taylor's husband is a pastor at has this background that involves the CIA. They even explicitly tell the true story about all these hippies.

And it has only made me focus more on this faith angle of TPUSA because I am telling you that when that individual— it was at his memorial. I hadn't even processed it because I was so in the grief stage. When they said that—something in me woke up—or they said it was just so strange that everything was about faith.

Over the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite Black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones and, of course, without antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. ^t-00-32-47

It's born in the USA, raised in the USA, and processed right here in the USA. The meat is aged to perfection for 21 days, and then it's shipped directly from their ranch to your home. So this is not your average Black Angus beef. This is more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef that I've ever tasted.

It's really hard to think about the holidays with everything being so expensive and credit cards already being pushed to the max. But with the rates dropping, now is the time that you can focus on paying off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They are saving people just like you an average of $800 a month. And many are seeing rates in below fives—which is a complete game-changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. And if you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving.

There's this push to seed an entire generation with this idea that they shouldn't want to own anything. They shouldn't aspire to ownership. They should just be renting.

Nothing should send to you a louder alarm that you should aspire to own property. You have every right to live where your grandparents lived, where your mother lived.

It's like they want—it does feel like they want to control and to own everything. Don't ignore that. Don't turn away from that. Don't think people are telling you wacky conspiracies.

And I'm like, "Get your head out of the sand. Like we fight. We go on." And there have been moments I've called you and said like, "This is it. It's over. Like I can't do this anymore." And he's been like, "You get your ass up out of bed, and you keep going." And it's so—so important for you guys to understand that—um—the next day it always does get better, guys. It gets better.

And also surround yourself with people like Candace (Candace Owens) that—whatever you're doing—that can relate and that when you say something that they're gonna tell you the truth and they're gonna be honest, but they'll also have your back. And I understand this might sound cliché, but it's so hard to find that. It's so hard to find that kind of loyalty. That—the kind of the old expression is— you know, when you're in a foxhole, you want someone who is not going to tell you that there's no bullets being fired. You want just to say where the bullets are coming from. Right? Yeah, that's exactly right. You don't want someone in the foxhole with you being like, "Well, you want to get a hot dog? Like maybe a burger or a smoothie." You want to say, "No, no, no. There's a machine gun nest over there." "There's mortar shells coming from there."

Like we gotta keep fighting, and you got this. The second thing though is it infuriated me because it is just—talk about a psychological operation. They moved in to try to rewrite history and convince masses that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk and I weren't friends. I will never get over that. I will actually never get over how absolutely insane and deranged the media is. They tried to invert reality—actually. People that weren't his friends were suddenly pretending that they were his friends and his supporters. I just will never forgive them for that. That is insane. ^t-00-39-00

And I was amazed re-watching that ending—the way he describes a person behind him walking—walking away—almost wild, considering—um—Mikey McCoy, the amazing Mikey McCoy, the not-so-amazing Mikey McCoy. And then he says this—he points over to the left there. And I'm now thinking—well, if he was right, I was happening behind him. What if there was something going on on the left? Now that I'm thinking about what I brought up to you—which was that bush—I have in the back of my mind been wondering about this bush. I have questions about that bush that they said Bush was talking to—again. I want to be clear. We see him near the bush by himself. ^t-00-39-44

These are eyewitness accounts on that day. And I just feel that maybe something may have been going on in that bush, right? Now there is an individual that I have had questions about, and I have tried to discern through private means who this individual is, and I have had no luck. So I'm going to ask the public for help because he's had my attention for a while— foremost because throughout the event, I noticed that he was halfway standing in the bush. Obviously, I've looked at so much content—different angles, so many videos—and he's kind of partially in the bush. And I don't feel that it's necessary for him to be partially in the bush. ^t-00-40-27

There was definitely space. The second thing that's compelling is that he's wearing a maroon shirt. And when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) goes down, he stood out to me because everyone ducks, but he just sort of keeps standing and seems to be— go inward—into the bush—and then out of the bush. And then I saw him from behind, and he's very calm. He never ducks, and then he sort of calmly walks away. Want to be clear—does not mean he's guilty of anything. But I'd like to speak to him because he might have some more insights as to what was going on in that bush. ^t-00-41-10

That might not be the circumstance, but we're going to show that clip anyway of a guy that does actually—as we looked—seem to be directing traffic away from the bush. Take a look at this. (Event footage clip) Let's see—right there on the side. You got people on the side there—standing, pointing away. Okay. Yeah, and there's someone in there like texting in a blue shirt. No, that could be because there's a shooting, and that's a safe spot to be in, and somebody can't see you. ^t-00-41-45

Doesn't mean anything, but I'm just pointing that out because we have to gather evidence that we're never gonna get from the feds. The second thing that I want to show you is what I just described—which is the clip of the person that I'm looking for who doesn't duck and calmly walks away. This is that individual. This is the front angle. You see that circle right there? We keep playing that. I've watched from other angles. Never goes down. Walks out of the bush. And I know that the police were looking for someone in a maroon shirt immediately after because somebody shared text messages with me that I did not publicize because I didn't want to. ^t-00-42-30

Now, this individual I was able to discern was in a photo with somebody else who's caught my attention. Of course, the media began playing—they had all of this—all of these clips of what happened. And there was one individual who was Indian who they got a lot of the footage from that day from. And what's interesting about this guy Samir— he's been covering everything as he was not a Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk fan. He somehow has a lot of footage and somehow immediately gave this footage to the media. I reached out to him privately, and I asked to have a conversation—asked to send his number. Despite speaking with the media for weeks—giving them all this footage— ^t-00-43-14

He didn't want to send me his number. I wanted to ask him basic questions. One of the questions I wanted to ask him was, "Hey, you are in a photo with this person in the maroon shirt." From that day—he posted a photo with him and the guy in the maroon shirt. And he makes it clear that they both went to BYU—his friend. I would like to know who Samir's friend is on the left. That's who I'm looking for. You might recognize this individual. If you do— ^t-00-43-59

Please email moretips@candaceowens.com. Moretips@candaceowens.com. Okay. Moving on from the person in the maroon shirt—but sticking on to this topic of the bush—people also sent me a ton of information about Butch Hibbs—Jack Hibbs' brother who was here. And maybe might have been speaking to that bush—I don't know. But he wasn't the only person, by the way, who was in that bush before the event. Here's another photo that was sent to us of a guy. I don't know—maybe he's comfortable in his bush. Who knows? Another guy in a maroon shirt. I never knew so many people—men loved maroon shirts. ^t-00-44-42

But we have another guy in there. Again, he literally might just be sending a private text. I don't know. But people sent us that, and that's interesting. And on the topic of Butch Hibbs, we got a flurry of videos of him after this shooting takes place. He's kind of just like crawling the area. He's up and around where the shooting happened. With what clearance? I don't know. You would think that they had secured the area and nobody would be allowed to go in. They certainly seemed to have crime scene tape, but some people were allowed in. He was. And beyond that, he is just acting— what I would say is strange—generally being shady.

I can't believe it happened in Utah of all places where he has so much support, but obviously the opposition was here. And now we're looking at a murder scene—possibly. It's obviously a crime scene.

The first was not my fault at all. The person that was supposed to come on the show—who has been basically effectively working on the finances for months—asked me to just wait one more week because he got swept up into something. So that was a cancellation. The second thing is the Egyptian plane. That—the thing about the Egyptian plane—is so explosive. Like I said to you, I had to try to get this to the right people in government. And those individuals asked me to wait until this weekend. The reason why they wanted me to wait is because this is the first time that we have the advantage. I don't know what to say other than it's—it's positively explosive.

Top comment from yesterday's episode: "Funny how Pastor McCoy could so easily believe—as he did with that guy who sexually abused a minor—could so easily believe that the police, the feds, the courts, the lawyers, and even the little girls were all involved in a conspiracy cover-up against a convicted predator— ^t-00-50-55

I recognized that as a clue, and that's what told me that I needed to hyper-focus on the faith angle—because the lies were unnecessary. Greg Bickford writes, "Keep calling them out." "The power grab in the vortex left behind is just too desperate to be genuine." Yeah, of course it's not genuine. Even yesterday—the Daily Mail—their AIPAC reporter, Victoria Churchill— ^t-00-55-59

All respect to Allie and the work she's done. "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk's TPUSA heiress" is how we're describing her—like— what? I'm sorry. What is that? Actually, what op are we in right now? Where the heiress to Turning Point USA is Allie Stuckey. That is a wild headline. And they repeated that—the heir apparent—in the Wall Street Journal. That's weird. It's weird because it's wrong, and it's not true. That's why it's weird. Not because she couldn't be an heiress or an heir to something, I suppose—but it's just totally wacky to try to fit that in there. That's very strange. ^t-00-56-36

The context of calling somebody the heiress of Turning Point USA would make sense— if you're referring to Erica. That's about it. That's literally probably it because she quite literally was the heir to Turning Point USA. Like she became the chairman. But that was—that's weird. Like that sort of stuff makes me go—what the heck is going on right now? Weird psychological operation. "Candace (Candace Owens), keep fighting for the truth and be safe." "I've recently realized we are at war, and the direction that this timeline of the world is literally going in is at stake." The fate of the future of America—down with the two-party system. I agree fully. Drew Cass writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), I feel like the Zionists are trying to distract you by making you debunk their lies." "We, as the people, believe you. Stay focused, my friend." ^t-00-57-22

The lies were just getting so crazy that sometimes I just have to call it out and be like, "This is completely crazy." We're just inverting reality. The Duchess of Camelot writes, "The fentanyl crisis is by design—allegedly." Yeah, our boys were guarding the poppy fields—and then in Afghanistan—and then we got an opioid crisis. And the Sackler family seems to be the only ones that benefited from that opioid crisis. Certainly not the American people. And that is why I also say do not let your sons fight in the military. That is so disrespectful that nothing is getting better in our country, and we are just sending our sons over to die for Israel. Their borders expand. Talking about the security of the Middle East. ^t-00-58-06

But I'm not going to go off on a rant about that. Anyways, you guys—we also promised you—which I totally forgot. I'm sorry. I had a crazy Friday, you guys. A long week homeschooling. I also said to you that I would address who yelled at Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I totally forgot to get the last name of that person until I saw it in the notes just now. But that I promise you I will actually have on Monday. So forgive me for just having a total mom brain at the moment. It's just been a long week. Thank you for your support, and we will see you on Monday. ^t-00-58-48
