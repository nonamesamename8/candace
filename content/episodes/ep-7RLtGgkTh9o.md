It is all about psychology. That is the name of the game. We are living inside of one big psychological operation. I am convinced. I've seen enough. There's just no other way to present that information. It's a fact. Now that everything is fake and gay—and dangerously so? I was freaking out realizing that quite literally all of our investigations over the past two years were coming together here. <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-01-21"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte Macron</a></span>—where did we end up, by the way?

They brought it up 18 times in the lawsuit against me—way too many times in the lawsuit against me. And I realized we were on the right path discussing this. It brought me back to that road. It brought me back to the Haight-Ashbury Clinic. We're gonna talk about that and the program that they're running throughout <span id="ent-gpe-california-t-00-02-03"><a href="/entities/gpe-california.md">California</a></span>. <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-02-03"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Ye</a></span>. When I said why I didn't speak out was because I recognized that he had done something tremendously brave, and that he—the entire mob mafia—descended on him. It was a psychological operation. They put him on a psych 5150 hold, which is one of their strategies. ^t-00-02-03

By putting on that psych 5150 hold. <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-02-48"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span>. I did a mini-series on <a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. We spoke about the blackmail. We spoke about the trafficking through big companies because nobody blinks an eye. If it's a modeling agency, nobody blinks an eye. As he was—he was funding tons of mechanisms, particularly models and movies. Harvey Weinstein connection. I spoke with him. It was very weird that they took out Harvey Weinstein.

Everybody understands what <a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a> Inc. is now. You see it everywhere. You cannot question <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> at all, or they descend on you. Somehow, the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk assassination is bringing together every single last one of these themes that we have been exploring. So, where did we leave off yesterday? Well, we spoke about the <span id="ent-org-calvary-chapel-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/org-calvary-chapel.md">Calvary Chapel</a></span>. We spoke about <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span> being the lead pastor in <span id="ent-gpe-thousand-oaks-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/gpe-thousand-oaks.md">Thousand Oaks</a></span>—one of their many churches across the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">United States</a></span>—and my sense... which every <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Christian Zionist</a></span> influencer under the sun is trying to ward me off of. Well, how dare she? This is—I can't even believe it. <span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Bibi</a></span> can blow up thousands and tens of thousands of kids, but <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-03-30"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> investigating the <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> Kirk assassination is crazy. ^t-00-03-30

It only furthered my sense that faith had somehow been infiltrated. Faith had become a military operation—or perhaps from the '60s onward, that's what it's always been, right? Too many instances—as I showed you yesterday—of trafficking and sexual abuse. You have to begin asking the question whether or not this is systemic and it's on purpose and who these pastors are working for. But I get an email yesterday which made me perk up—a flurry of emails, actually. Thank you guys—telling me to stay the course because the <span id="ent-org-calvary-chapel-t-00-04-14"><a href="/entities/org-calvary-chapel.md">Calvary Chapel</a></span> was also involved in <span id="ent-person-britney-spears-t-00-04-14"><a href="/entities/person-britney-spears.md">Britney Spears</a></span>' conservatorship.

There were so many TikToks, so many people that did the research, dedicated their time to it. I just wasn't one of them. And I will therefore make it clear that I am not an expert on this case. I obviously could not have become an expert overnight. But after speaking with <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-04-58"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Ye</a></span> and being a part of that—being around him when everything went down—I got the gist of the fact that celebrities are very much controlled: what they can say, what they can't say, who they're allowed to date. And if they step one bit out of the carefully orchestrated narrative, something comes down on them and begins to control them in operation. I get the gist. ^t-00-04-58

So <a href="/entities/person-lou-taylor.md">Lou Taylor</a> became involved with <span id="ent-person-britney-spears-t-00-06-14"><a href="/entities/person-britney-spears.md">Britney Spears</a></span> in 2007 after she was hired to help manage <span id="ent-person-jamie-lynn-spears-t-00-06-14"><a href="/entities/person-jamie-lynn-spears.md">Jamie Lynn Spears</a></span>.<span id="event-event-2007-01-01-lou-taylor-hired-to-manage-jamie-lynn-sp-t-00-06-14"><a href="/events/event-2007-01-01-lou-taylor-hired-to-manage-jamie-lynn-sp.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> And this was right around the time that Jamie<span id="event-event-2024-10-15-bob-bryar-tweets-criticism-of-lou-taylor-and-karda-t-00-06-14"><a href="/events/event-2024-10-15-bob-bryar-tweets-criticism-of-lou-taylor-and-karda.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2008-02-01-britney-spears-conservatorship-implemented-by-fath-t-00-06-14"><a href="/events/event-2008-02-01-britney-spears-conservatorship-implemented-by-fath.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> got pregnant. Now, somehow—no one really knows. I mean, this is not documented at all. She was brought into the fold of this family by their father, Jamie. This is Jamie Senior. And by 2008—so less than a year later—Lou was going on TV shows as the family's spokesperson to speak on behalf of Britney. <a href="/entities/person-lou-taylor.md">Lou Taylor</a> is the business manager for <a href="/entities/person-britney-spears.md">Britney Spears</a>' father, mother, and younger sister, Jamie Lynn. Lou, good morning to you. ^t-00-06-14

I mean, when do you ever rest in that if you're constantly in fear of being exploited? Every day, Jamie goes to work as a professional chef, asking the Lord to give him the strength to honor the people he works for in the midst of circumstances. Lynn Spears is a mother that is brokenhearted just because she's apart from her daughter, that she loves her daughter so much, and again, asking every day for God to give her strength and for her to continue to have hope. ^t-00-06-46

So this was all around 2008. But the missing piece here—and guys, this is what shocked me—is that Jamie Senior had around this time allegedly filed for bankruptcy. He had done this multiple times, and <span id="ent-person-lou-taylor-t-00-07-26"><a href="/entities/person-lou-taylor.md">Lou Taylor</a></span>'s firm gave Britney's dad a loan of $40,000. Now, we don't know why, but he had just filed for bankruptcy, and this woman gave him $40,000. Now, within months of this loan, the conservatorship of <span id="ent-person-britney-spears-t-00-07-26"><a href="/entities/person-britney-spears.md">Britney Spears</a></span> was implemented. This was in February of 2008. But Lou and her father—even though Britney was apparently not able to function, she needed to be under this conservatorship—they kept her career going. Listen to this. Only months after arguing that his daughter was incapacitated and therefore needed to be under his control, ^t-00-07-26

She's not here to just oversee brands or help deals be made. She's not like an agent or that kind of thing. She was playing the role of business manager, which is a financial role. Even though <a href="/entities/person-lou-taylor.md">Lou Taylor</a> had no financial background—she was not even an accountant. And most business managers—my business manager—is an accountant. <a href="/entities/person-lou-taylor.md">Lou Taylor</a> actually started her career in a church working alongside her husband, who at the time was a pastor at <span id="ent-org-calvary-chapel-t-00-10-43"><a href="/entities/org-calvary-chapel.md">Calvary Chapel</a></span> in Brentwood, <span id="ent-gpe-california-t-00-10-43"><a href="/entities/gpe-california.md">California</a></span>. And interestingly enough, according to financial documents that are in the public domain, Jamie Sr. was giving 10% of his income that he was making off of <span id="ent-person-britney-spears-t-00-10-43"><a href="/entities/person-britney-spears.md">Britney Spears</a></span> from the conservatorship to the church where <a href="/entities/person-lou-taylor.md">Lou Taylor</a>'s husband was a pastor. ^t-00-10-43

Mr. Spears at times gave 10% of his conservatorship income to the Taylors' <span id="ent-org-calvary-chapel-t-00-11-28"><a href="/entities/org-calvary-chapel.md">Calvary Chapel</a></span> Brentwood—a practice known as tithing—according to a 2010 financial document. Mr. Spears gave tens of thousands of dollars in one year alone to the church, which is about 500 miles away from where he lives in Louisiana. Now obviously since then, all of this information has come out, and Britney has now accused Lou of playing a major role in her exploitation. And even though Lou denies all of this and continues to deny everything through emails obtained through Britney's trials, it is clear that in some way, Lou was involved. This is from the <span id="ent-org-la-times-t-00-11-28"><a href="/entities/org-la-times.md">LA Times</a></span>. <span id="ent-person-britney-spears-t-00-11-28"><a href="/entities/person-britney-spears.md">Britney Spears</a></span>' lawyer emails show ex-business manager helped set up conservatorship. ^t-00-11-28

And if they cannot control those individuals, they will stage some sort of a hostile takeover of that brand or of that company or of that particular person.

So if you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than now to get your finances in order. It's really hard to think about the holidays with everything being so expensive and credit cards already being pushed to the max. But with the rates dropping, now is the time that you can focus on paying off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They are saving people just like you an average of $800 a month. And many are seeing rates in below fives—which is a complete game-changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. And if you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before we know it. So don't wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today. ^t-00-34-09

You know, there's this whole idea that in the future what they ultimately want is for us to own nothing and to be happy. And we are seeing that play out right now. There's this push to seed an entire generation with this idea that they shouldn't want to own anything. They shouldn't aspire to ownership. They should just be renting. I even had a conversation with Mylonopoulos, and we spoke about how that's kind of the point of making everything look really ugly and tiny and the walls are thin.

You have every right to live where your grandparents lived, where your mother lived. Ancestry is very important, and I feel that they are trying to wipe that.

And I understand this might sound cliché, but it's so hard to find that. It's so hard to find that kind of loyalty. That—the kind of the old expression is— you know, when you're in a foxhole, you want someone who is not going to tell you that there's no bullets being fired. You want just to say where the bullets are coming from. Right? Yeah, that's exactly right. You don't want someone in the foxhole with you being like, "Well, you want to get a hot dog?

Like we gotta keep fighting, and you got this. The second thing though is it infuriated me because it is just—talk about a psychological operation. They moved in to try to rewrite history and convince masses that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-39-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk and I weren't friends. I will never get over that. I will actually never get over how absolutely insane and deranged the media is. They tried to invert reality—actually.

Now that I'm thinking about what I brought up to you—which was that bush—I have in the back of my mind been wondering about this bush. I have questions about that bush that they said Bush was talking to—again. I want to be clear. We see him near the bush by himself. ^t-00-39-44

These are eyewitness accounts on that day. And I just feel that maybe something may have been going on in that bush, right? Now there is an individual that I have had questions about, and I have tried to discern through private means who this individual is, and I have had no luck. So I'm going to ask the public for help because he's had my attention for a while— foremost because throughout the event, I noticed that he was halfway standing in the bush. Obviously, I've looked at so much content—different angles, so many videos—and he's kind of partially in the bush.

And when <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-41-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> goes down, he stood out to me because everyone ducks, but he just sort of keeps standing and seems to be— go inward—into the bush—and then out of the bush. And then I saw him from behind, and he's very calm. He never ducks, and then he sort of calmly walks away. Want to be clear—does not mean he's guilty of anything. But I'd like to speak to him because he might have some more insights as to what was going on in that bush. ^t-00-41-10

That might not be the circumstance, but we're going to show that clip anyway of a guy that does actually—as we looked—seem to be directing traffic away from the bush. Take a look at this. (Event footage clip) Let's see—right there on the side. You got people on the side there—standing, pointing away. Okay. Yeah, and there's someone in there like texting in a blue shirt.

The second thing that I want to show you is what I just described—which is the clip of the person that I'm looking for who doesn't duck and calmly walks away. This is that individual. This is the front angle. You see that circle right there? We keep playing that. I've watched from other angles. Never goes down. Walks out of the bush. And I know that the police were looking for someone in a maroon shirt immediately after because somebody shared text messages with me that I did not publicize because I didn't want to. ^t-00-42-30

And there was one individual who was Indian who they got a lot of the footage from that day from.

He didn't want to send me his number. I wanted to ask him basic questions. One of the questions I wanted to ask him was, "Hey, you are in a photo with this person in the maroon shirt." From that day—he posted a photo with him and the guy in the maroon shirt. And he makes it clear that they both went to BYU—his friend. I would like to know who Samir's friend is on the left.

The first was not my fault at all. The person that was supposed to come on the show—who has been basically effectively working on the finances for months—asked me to just wait one more week because he got swept up into something. So that was a cancellation. The second thing is the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-50-11"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> plane. That—the thing about the <a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a> plane—is so explosive. Like I said to you, I had to try to get this to the right people in government. And those individuals asked me to wait until this weekend. The reason why they wanted me to wait is because this is the first time that we have the advantage. I don't know what to say other than it's—it's positively explosive. That's all I can say to you and presenting this to the public. ^t-00-50-11

And in many ways, we're still trying to understand it ourselves. So I want to say Monday, but because I'm not fully in control of that information, I would say next week—tentatively next week. Okay. Top comment from yesterday's episode: "Funny how Pastor McCoy could so easily believe—as he did with that guy who sexually abused a minor—could so easily believe that the police, <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-50-55"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span>, the courts, the lawyers, and even the little girls were all involved in a conspiracy cover-up against a convicted predator— ^t-00-50-55

Like, if you want to really see the psychological operation of Christian <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-51-38"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> all saying the same thing—many of them are taking money. Obviously, there's a lot of money on the line. <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-51-38"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> has raised so much money. Themselves—you will start to recognize these sorts of tactics, like just the hypocrisy—the astounding hypocrisy—where they will just be totally mum on the death of Palestinians. It'll be like, "How dare <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-51-38"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> even ask another question and not accept the narrative?" "<span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-51-38"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">The feds</a></span> have always been honest with us about everything." Something stinks. You are so right.

And that runs through to Cyber Monday, so don't miss out on that because everything's fake and gay—and that's a good merch drop. All right, you guys. Also getting into some more of these comments. Access Gaming writes, "Did you see that there are seven <span id="ent-org-calvary-chapel-t-00-52-23"><a href="/entities/org-calvary-chapel.md">Calvary Chapel</a></span> churches near Huntington Beach, <span id="ent-gpe-california-t-00-52-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-california.md">California</a></span>?" "That is the epicenter of the Family International movement—AKA the Children of God." "Their practices are very familiar." "Also, the <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-52-23"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a></span> jump scares keep sending me." We have no idea what you're talking about with the <a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a> jump scares. I kid, of course. Yes, I'm sorry. We just try to get up-to-date photos.

"Which saint's relic do you have behind you?" "There is a special reason you have this saint." Yeah, I spoke about this on another show. It was gifted to me by a priest while I was out in <span id="ent-gpe-wyoming-t-00-53-05"><a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a></span>, and it is from <span id="ent-person-saint-michael-t-00-53-05"><a href="/entities/person-saint-michael.md">St. Michael</a></span>'s Holy Cave in Italy. So yes, I was very grateful to have that, and that is a very powerful prayer of protection.

I totally agree with that sentiment that thieves do not break into an empty house. They are overreacting to any questions. They're lying about what I'm saying. They're taking me out of context intentionally and pretending that we're doing all of this on the basis of a dream and that we never had any evidence. And that feels to me like they are fearful—and they should be fearful. Whatever they are hiding, I'm going to find. Christopher Jolly writes, "Are <span id="ent-concept-christians-t-00-53-48"><a href="/entities/concept-christians.md">Christians</a></span>." "Many LDS members like me love your work." "Any <span id="ent-person-thomas-crooks-t-00-53-48"><a href="/entities/person-thomas-crooks.md">crooks</a></span>—please bust them." "We want truth." "Wheat grows together until the last day."

I'm old. The reality and the danger of organized evil. Yes, of course. And I want to be very clear that a lot of the stuff that I have been able to find out in this investigation has been because of Mormons that have been willing to go on the ground to ask questions, to get me information, to get me phone numbers. Would not have been possible without these young Mormon students. So I'm incredibly grateful. And I always just say that and remind people because sometimes when you're speaking about something, it can feel like a personal attack. And the reality is the <span id="ent-concept-devil-t-00-54-30"><a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a></span> loves to go in places where he can be the most deceptive.

And suddenly they're starting to realize you're getting a political message. Something is not right with <a href="/entities/org-calvary-chapel.md">Calvary Chapel</a>. I stand by that. We lost someone that has an email and said—because I discussed <a href="/entities/org-calvary-chapel.md">Calvary Chapel</a>'s abuse history—they would no longer support us. Like, I've always been very clear on the topic of abusing kids. Bye. Like forever—I will never shut up on these topics. If something happens and it's relevant, I will always cover it on this show. Most of all, when I start to recognize that something happened at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-55-15"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> and the faith movement seems to be at the center of it—it's very bizarre. The lies—actually, when you start to go through the list of <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> lies—so many of them surround the topic of faith, which is very strange. ^t-00-55-15

He wasn't allowed to be interested in Catholicism. How weird. Why? Why is the faith part so important? Think about that. Why were the lies that were surrounding that came out of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-55-59"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>—which you were able to debunk—so many of them were faith-focused? That's a clue. I recognized that as a clue, and that's what told me that I needed to hyper-focus on the faith angle—because the lies were unnecessary. Greg Bickford writes, "Keep calling them out." "The power grab in the vortex left behind is just too desperate to be genuine." Yeah, of course it's not genuine. Even yesterday—the <span id="ent-org-daily-mail-t-00-55-59"><a href="/entities/org-daily-mail.md">Daily Mail</a></span>—their <span id="ent-org-aipac-t-00-55-59"><a href="/entities/org-aipac.md">AIPAC</a></span> reporter, <span id="ent-person-victoria-churchill-t-00-55-59"><a href="/entities/person-victoria-churchill.md">Victoria Churchill</a></span>— ^t-00-55-59

I'm sorry. What is that? Actually, what op are we in right now? Where the heiress to <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-56-36"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> is <a href="/entities/person-allie-beth-stuckey.md">Allie</a> Stuckey.

And they repeated that—the heir apparent—in the <span id="ent-org-wall-street-journal-t-00-56-36"><a href="/entities/org-wall-street-journal.md">Wall Street Journal</a></span>. That's weird. It's weird because it's wrong, and it's not true. That's why it's weird. Not because she couldn't be an heiress or an heir to something, I suppose—but it's just totally wacky to try to fit that in there. That's very strange. ^t-00-56-36

The context of calling somebody the heiress of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-57-22"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> would make sense— if you're referring to Erika. That's about it. That's literally probably it because she quite literally was the heir to <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a>. Like she became the chairman. But that was—that's weird. Like that sort of stuff makes me go—what the heck is going on right now? Weird psychological operation. "<a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>, keep fighting for the truth and be safe." "I've recently realized we are at war, and the direction that this timeline of the world is literally going in is at stake."

The lies were just getting so crazy that sometimes I just have to call it out and be like, "This is completely crazy." We're just inverting reality. The Duchess of Camelot writes, "The fentanyl crisis is by design—allegedly." Yeah, our boys were guarding the poppy fields—and then in Afghanistan—and then we got an opioid crisis. And the Sackler family seems to be the only ones that benefited from that opioid crisis. Certainly not the American people. And that is why I also say do not let your sons fight in the military. That is so disrespectful that nothing is getting better in our country, and we are just sending our sons over to die for <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-58-06"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>.

But I'm not going to go off on a rant about that. Anyways, you guys—we also promised you—which I totally forgot. I'm sorry. I had a crazy Friday, you guys. A long week homeschooling. I also said to you that I would address who yelled at <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-58-48"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, and I totally forgot to get the last name of that person until I saw it in the notes just now.

Thank you for your support, and we will see you on Monday. ^t-00-58-48
