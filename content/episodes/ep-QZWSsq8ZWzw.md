**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=1" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-00-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** All right, you guys. It is Wednesday, and I have a lot for you today. Because you're not gonna be surprised to hear that the FBI is FBI-ing. That's what they do. And that's what they want to happen with the Charlie Kirk case. Of course, this was inevitable. I gotta tell you all about that. Also, I wanna open up to you guys about this overwhelming sense of doom that came over me about 10 days prior to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. The story's kind of unbelievable, but I think it's important to share—especially with the way that the FBI is traveling here, trying to shut this case down. And it is also somewhat related to another explosive story that I have for you today because do you remember Thomas Matthew Crooks? ^t-00-00-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=45" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-00-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Probably not, because oddly the feds told us that, hey, don't even worry about that 20-year-old who got up on a rooftop and tried to assassinate President Donald Trump, right? That story just got buried. Well, today we have some exclusive information about him. Never-before-seen footage of Thomas Matthew Crooks, and it's going to be just the beginning of our coverage regarding what we know. So welcome back to Candace (Candace Owens). Okay, so let's start with the breaking news. I don't even know if it's considered breaking news when it comes to the feds. ^t-00-00-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=90" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-01-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Look, I don't think it's breaking news. I think it's just the news. This is what they do. Well, I have it now on a very well-placed, authoritative source that the FBI is putting an absurd amount of pressure right now on the authorities in Utah and also the rest of the government in Utah to come out and say that the Charlie Kirk case is closed. They want it over. They want Charlie Kirk's assassination to be officially ruled lone gunman. It was a lone gunman that did that. Nobody else is involved. Now, why would they? Why would they want that, right? What are they saying at least to the authorities? ^t-00-01-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=133" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-02-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Are they saying like, "Hmm, this is the reason—"? I'm sure they're not coming out and being honest or saying something that might ring truer to us, the public, which would be them saying, "Well, we know who did this, and we want to protect those people, so close the case." What they're actually saying instead is essentially, "If you don't close the case against Charlie Kirk and rule it a lone gunman, then it might mess up our prosecution against Tyler Robinson." That feels a little bit to me like moral blackmail. "Hey man, we're not hiding anything, but we've got this guy, Tyler Robinson." "If you don't close this case, then it might harm our chances of locking this guy up." ^t-00-02-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=178" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-02-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Yeah. I'm sure. I am sure that they are being just moral. I'm sure they're telling the truth to the authorities. Now, I want to remind you guys. We should take a look at their current case against Tyler Robinson to see if we should accept this narrative because currently there is absolutely no video which shows Tyler Robinson firing the weapon or even taking aim at Charlie Kirk. In fact, the individual who filmed the footage of the shooter on the roof—the lone video that exists of the shooter on the roof—also told me that he doesn't think that Tyler Robinson is the guy. So how's that gonna work for an eyewitness account? ^t-00-02-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=222" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-03-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** When he reported the shooter on the roof to Utah on the campus, he was clear that the person was wearing an entirely different outfit than the ones that they're currently trying to claim that Tyler wore on that day. Remember, Tyler was just supposed to be wearing a t-shirt and some jeans. He says, "No, he was in tactical gear." "The person that I saw was in tactical gear." Also, that eyewitness told me that that gun doesn't even match what I saw. And like I said, this individual definitively has experience with guns. He teaches people how to fire guns. ^t-00-03-42

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=262" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-04-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So according to him and what he observed, if he's going to be brought into this court case that they're saying they want to—you know, they don't bring charges against Tyler—he's gonna testify and say, "No, that doesn't look like the gun." "That doesn't look like the person." So how's this going to work? Also, according to the individual that told me this, regarding the feds trying to push for this case closure, they also—the feds—don't even have any footage that explains how exactly the rifle in particular got onto the roof. That stuns me. That's stunning information, right? ^t-00-04-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=300" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-05-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** 'Cause all we have is, well, in the indictment, he dropped onto the roof at 12:15 PM. Tyler Robinson just dropped onto the roof. I guess in our minds, we assumed on the basis of the picture that they released—the sole picture or set of pictures from the same moment—of him walking up the stairs. We assumed that he, like I said, stanky-legged it—the whole stanky leg all the way up onto the rooftop. That was our perception. But it turns out, according to my source, they don't know how the rifle got onto the roof. That's interesting. How are we bringing this to trial? ^t-00-05-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=335" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-05-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, regarding the bullet, the source says that it was too fragmented to match Tyler's rifle, so they don't have even the bullet. And let us not forget that Tyler himself has not confessed to anything. And that part also didn't make sense. He said they brought him in. Bail bondsman puts up a million dollars. Tyler's dad gets the sheriff friend to come over, and they say he did it, and the police come, and they say arrest him. They bring Tyler Robinson in, but Tyler Robinson doesn't confess? So how did you arrest him? Does that make sense? How could you make an arrest if you didn't have a confession? You would have to have evidence, and the evidence can't be "trust my dad, bro." ^t-00-05-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=378" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-06-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** If I just bring in a random person, I say, "Oh, look, Skyler just committed this crime," and Skyler says, "No, I didn't," and he doesn't confess, the police can't just make an arrest. You can't just arrest Skyler. Nothing is making sense at all. It has not made sense from the very beginning, okay? And that's because the feds are involved. And I believe the feds know exactly what happened. In fact, I don't think it's a stretch of imagination when we examine history to assume that they maybe even had some foreknowledge on everybody. ^t-00-06-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=411" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-06-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Not everybody, obviously, because some people are trying to get the information out and are trying to figure out what happened. But we know that there are people that are a part of that apparatus who are terrible human beings—who we do not want ruling over us—and yet they do. So I'm just curious what exactly, how exactly they believe they are going to convict Tyler Robinson on this. Oh, you know what? It's probably the Discord messages. I forgot, silly me. The Discord. I forgot. It was so explicit. How could we forget? Oh, Lance, oh, Lance, wherefore art thou, Lance? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. ^t-00-06-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=450" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-07-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And if thou wilt not, Lance, thee bullet, me, my handprint. It was me. It was me, my love. I did everything I carved. Do you remember, my love, when I was carving the bullets? Yes. Yes. Exactly. This time is when I did it. And these are the reasons, my MAGA daddy, my love. Thou wilt not, my love. Cool. Cool story. Very cool story, feds. Kind of feeling like Tyler's going to get off because they've got really nothing but prints. And from my sources, it's not the only set of prints that are on that gun. ^t-00-07-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=486" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-08-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** In fact, the only thing that I have heard that made sense—which did not come from our government, did not come from the feds, did not come from the Utah government, but rather from the people that are on the ground, who believe that actually Tyler was just told to walk and drop off his gun at a neighboring house— that, for some reason, just feels like that might be honest and that was how he participated in this event. But we'll see, because I'm not going to let this go. So we'll see if the feds tell us to just dismiss it as they always do. You know, rather relatedly, something that I want to tell you: yesterday we had showed you a clip of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) discussing our friendship and how he was feeling morally blackmailed over it. ^t-00-08-06

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=526" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-08-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And in that same clip, he mentions a very fond memory that I have—that he was there when I met my husband. And he says, "It's a really fun story." And it is a fun story. It's actually a totally fun, crazy story of how I met my husband. Because it was—I had something that came over me, and that's the only way I can describe it. And I get all of the conspiracies online when people were like, "There's no way she, her and her husband got engaged after 18 days." That's exactly how it happened. I didn't know him. I never even saw his face 18 days prior. And I'm with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). We're hitting the ground running. And I'm just like, I feel compelled that we must go to the UK. It was—when I say the most overpowering thing ever—I was like, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk), we got to go to the UK." "We got to go to the UK." "We should go to the UK." "We should go to London." ^t-00-08-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=571" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-09-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And he's like, "Man, why?" "Why do you want to go to London?" I'm like, "I don't know." "I just feel like we're supposed to be there." "I feel like we've got to be there for an event." And I did something that I had never done. I took Charlie Kirk's credit card, and I was like, "I'm going to find flights and just book it." And then you just figure out maybe it means you're supposed to start, you know, Turning Point UK. There's energy there. That was a part of his vision. He wanted Turning Point to be global. And he had had people that were interested in the UK. And so I actually am showing you this very old text message chain from that time between me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk), where I even picked—I never booked flights, looked at flights—but I booked these flights. And I was like, "Look, the flights are dirt cheap." From NYC to London: $450 in coach or $1,200 in first class. And he's like, "Wow, let's book it." ^t-00-09-31

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=616" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-10-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** All right. We booked the flights, and then suddenly I realized the reason that I had this overwhelming feeling to be there was because I was supposed to meet my husband. And the only thing I can say is that it was an intuition. We describe it that it had to have been God. We just had no reason, no other reason to be there. And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) set up a speaking event with some people that had been interested, and sure enough, we were there to help Turning Point UK get set up. Anyways, this overwhelming feeling. I had never experienced something like that since, until about a week before—or actually 10 days before—Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got assassinated. ^t-00-10-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=658" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-10-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And so I'm gonna explain that to you because you guys who watch this podcast might have realized something—that we took the show off air randomly for the first couple of days in September. So I will describe to you exactly what happened. You know, there at first was an elementary school shooting that happened at a Catholic school. And I was just concerned in a way that I had never felt so impacted. And I was going, something isn't right. Something is just not right. And I felt that there was some sort of an infiltration that was happening at schools. ^t-00-10-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=689" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-11-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And the best way that I can describe it really in a sentence is that I sensed that the danger wasn't stopping there and that more was coming, and that I needed to take time, take a look at just the process of hiring people at the school that my children were going to attend. And I did just a cursory online search, and some messages I found—which were not written by a teacher at the school, but someone who was adjacent to some teachers at the school—gave me pause for concern. In fact, explicitly what it was was a Polish underground symbol—like a Polish communist underground symbol—that nobody would have recognized outside of people who know what it meant. And I just sort of went, "Okay, that's weird." ^t-00-11-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=734" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-12-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I kept looking online and strangely—I'm not kidding, and I'm gonna show you these messages— I came across what looked to me like a bunch of people talking about bees. Like literally bees, in a way that the only way I can describe it to you is like—they were speaking about bees, but they weren't speaking about bees. It was very coded. And I'm going, am I going crazy, or do you think that all these people are really actually, quote-unquote, "bee farmers" or saying that they farm bees? What is this lingo that I'm not understanding? Why do I feel like it's related to students? I didn't feel good about it at all. ^t-00-12-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=773" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-12-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And I just sensed that we needed to get more involved, to go to the school, to ask about the process of hiring, to see if they needed more security. They were kind of giving me the—you know—the thing that teachers do now when you ask any questions about what happens at the school, which is they make you think like, "Why do you want to know?" Like, "We just do whatever we want to do." It's like, "I don't know." My children are like five and four, actually. Parents should, of course, we need to be more involved. Like, how did we get here that we feel like we're crazy for asking questions about the hiring practices at schools? And the feeling just didn't go away. I can show you this actually because I was thinking—like I said to my husband—there is some weird underground. It's like I sense like imminent danger is coming. ^t-00-12-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=818" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-13-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And for some reason, I feel like there is an underground that has emerged at schools. And it's like related to bees. That's what I said. And I messaged multiple people about this. My sister—here are a couple of more text messages to other people. You can look at the time frame here. This is August 30th. This is September 1st. We went off air September 2nd. We were off air. And I started talking about people that were discussing bees in a way that didn't make sense. I'm like, "I don't know if this is drugs. I don't know what it is, but it's weird." And so in a sentence, I just said, "There's imminent danger coming, okay?" "It is relating to a school." "I think it's a communist underground, and I don't know why, but it has something to do with bees." Totally sensible thing to say to your husband. Oh, and we need to hire more security. And we did. We hired more security that very week. ^t-00-13-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=862" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-14-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And I was just frantic about it. And we made the decision that we needed to homeschool immediately and started the process—pulled our kids out of school and started to interview people. But it wasn't enough. Like, despite hiring more security, despite taking my kids out of school, I still had a sense of dread. The Tuesday—Tuesday night—the night before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got assassinated—I had book club, and I felt like I needed to emphasize to people in book club that it was time to take their kids out of school. Like, "Take your kids out of school." "Something dangerous is happening right now." And I'm going to show you a clip. Obviously this is all behind the paywall of what I said to people that are in the book club. Take a listen. ^t-00-14-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=903" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-15-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** "I'm homeschooling my kids." "I'm so excited." "I'm like very excited." "I'm embarking on this recent decision." And it is just—I feel—I can't explain to you when a weight got lifted off my shoulders because I was like, "I can't just speak about this." Like, "We have to do it and show people that it can be done." And I'm so glad that my sister was—who did it first—because I was like, "My sister, it was very difficult for her to do this." "She's got to wake up super early." But seeing her do it made me go, "My older sister. I was like, what is wrong with me?" "Of course I can do this." And again, this weight being lifted off my shoulders of like, "You don't get my kids." This whole system, this whole matrix—gotta send your kids to school so we can what? Indoctrinate them mentally. In some schools, there's abuses that are happening. ^t-00-15-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=947" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-15-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Like, and I just have to take the risk and give you my child—like my small child—and then you're going to gaslight me. This is what happened actually. I was like asking the school basic questions like—because I was only going to put them in like, you know, a little daycare program, pre-K program— and like, I was like, "You know, ask questions like, how do you hire people?" And they were like, "You don't get to ask those questions." "What's wrong with you, Mom?" "Why are you so scared?" I'm like, "Okay, bye-bye." "See you never." "Don't make me think that I'm weird for being a mom, okay?" "Don't make me believe or try to sell to me this idea that we're sharing these kids." These are your students. These are my kids. And if you don't understand that, then they can't be your students. ^t-00-15-47

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=994" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-16-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** That was on September 9th, okay. Then came September 10th. Obviously Charlie (Charlie Kirk) lost his life. And a few days later, I was told—and I sensed instantly—that there was like a hive of people that were involved in this. I just knew it. And when it happened, I just went, "Oh my goodness." And my gut is telling me that this was the thing—that the dread that I sensed that was coming out of school. And I had no idea. I am not a flag person at all. And then someone told me—and I was astonished—that Utah recently, extraordinarily, modernized their beehive flag. I had no idea that the Utah state flag is a hexagonal beehive, right? ^t-00-16-34

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=1037" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-17-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And I mean, notice to me that it has always been the Beehive State. So in 2024, they modernized their flag, but they've always been known as the Beehive State. And to be clear, it's not because they make honey. It's not because they have a high presence of bees. In fact, in terms of making honey or bee-related products, they rank number 24. It's actually the Beehive State. It relates to the Mormon Church—the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Early Mormon pioneers founded that state, and they liked the idea of a beehive working toward a common good. Now, if that sounds vaguely familiar or communist to you—the idea of worker bees— yes, that's where it's from. ^t-00-17-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=1076" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-17-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So this sort of doom that I had about an underground happening—I was just like, totally freaked out. It's this. It's a Soviet symbol and the idea of making everybody into a worker bee. And whether you're on the left or the right, you should understand where the public school system comes from. It is shaped by Soviet ideology. I tell people a must-read book is Inside American Education by Thomas Sowell. It is not left or right. He is just telling you how it all came together—the decline, the deception, the dogmas—and how they are programming our children. You cannot unread that book after you read it because you realize there's no such thing as being too hawkish. ^t-00-17-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=1116" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-18-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** They know how to get things in there and how to pull children away from their parents—as it was designed in the Soviet system, okay? Kindergarten even—kindergarten—you're like, where does that word even come from? Well, it was established by the communists that tried to overthrow Germany and failed. In 1848, Margarethe Schurz—her family—came here, and those same communists wanted to make sure that they established kindergarten access to children. They then fought to make sure that we federalized the education system. These are the same people that pushed to make it so that homeschooling is not a thing. ^t-00-18-36

They understand something that I think that we have maybe forgotten, which is that children are the most precious resource. The reason for that is because they are the future. One way or another, children are the future, okay? After Charlie Kirk's assassination, that feeling still did not dissipate. Okay, I understood the imminent doom that I felt—that was almost crippling—was clearly related to that event. But I just know that all of these random lone shooter narratives that are being intentionally—what we're being told—that they're just lone shooters and then we don't really know anything else. ^t-00-19-14

And perhaps that is the reason why, more often than not, they are being protected by our government. In other words, it is positively foolish for us to believe that the government just cannot tell us anything about these assassins. They wipe everything, and they tell us nothing. Why would they do that? Yeah, that guy—they're always working alone. There's no online history that we can reflect on. What are you talking about? ^t-00-19-59

Gratefully, Donald Trump did not die, but tragically, one of his supporters did, okay? A 50-year-old firefighter named Corey Comparatore lost his life trying to save his children. And then we were told virtually nothing. In fact, we were—and I'm laughing because it's so absurd— we were told Iran did this. What? Because they were itching for war with Iran. Like, they're still itching for war with Iran, but like that's what basically was the narrative that was established. ^t-00-20-29

Well, guess what happened? Somebody reached out to me because I have been—obviously—leading the forefront in investigating this lone shooter as it pertains to Charlie Kirk because it's not a lone shooter. It's a hive. I feel it spiritually. And they said, "Look, actually, I had been able to scrape everything about Thomas Matthew Crooks before the feds got rid of everything." And it's shocking what you look at. There is no way this person was not on the federal radar. Now, usually we go, was he on the left? Was he on the right? Because that's the bait. ^t-00-21-12

The reality of Thomas Matthew Crooks is going to be a story that we should get familiar with. He was... at both—on the left and on the right. He actually traded sides. He started actually as a Trump supporter. I'm gonna show you—and again, to really impress upon you how much this person had to be on the federal radar— I have an 80-page document, which I'm thinking I'm just gonna drop on my website tomorrow after handing it over to legal, of all the accounts that he made, all the statements that he made. And he was at first very angry against the left. ^t-00-21-55

Don't worry, we blurred the weapon just to keep things above board here. Take a look. ^t-00-22-39

And his online history—there's multiple videos that are like this, which I have—his online history shows he was extraordinarily violent. He was always calling for violence. And I can show you one of his comments that he made. This was a comment on a video, "Trump Humiliated on National TV," and he wrote to someone, "Haha, that's funny because I always believed being patriotic was lining up a bunch of socialist Jews like the ones that booed Trump and blasting their useless brains out with an AR—all to each his own." ^t-00-23-13

Again, another comment where he was commenting on a YouTube video. He wrote, "I've noticed a lot of liars talking about the truth in this post." "Well, let me know. Let me tell you some truth." "Everyone of the Trump-hating Democrats deserves to have their heads chopped off and put on stakes for the world to see what happens when you F with America." So you go, "Okay, this guy was a Trump supporter." Then he does a radical transformation around 2020. And this had something to do with COVID. He got very angry at Trump, and he was outwardly saying things where people were reporting them on YouTube, being like, "This guy is absolutely insane." "He is a maniac." "He's a maniac." He was a maniac who was obsessed with Trump one way or the other. ^t-00-23-58

He just starts going completely crazy. And he is explicitly researching on Google the history of these assassinations. I can show you his search history here. I'm leading up to this. He searched "best places for a mass shooting." Here are some of his other Google searches. I think we can just scroll down here. Yeah, okay. And this has a timeline on this. Again, I'm going to probably just post this document because you can handle the truth. He was fascinated with this stuff. He was fascinated. ^t-00-24-41

"How to Molotov cocktail," "how to make Molotov cocktails"—pardon me—"mixing gasoline with styrofoam," "mass shooting in Canada," "Oklahoma bombing," "sniper in Dallas shooting."

Mom's walking in the room. He's practicing how to shoot. It's very clear what you can see in the background. He's practicing shots. They want us to believe that this just happened by accident—even though for years he was documenting wanting to harm politicians and people that were on the left and people that were on the right. Again, on the basis of everything—whether it was their race, their color, whether they were homosexual—there's something there for everyone. So what's happening here?

And so I wanted to express that to you—that we once again are having a predicament, and we can trace this straight from what they did to when JFK was assassinated, where the feds are obscuring. They are using journalists to obscure. They are putting pressure on government officials. They are lying to the public about everything—except this time it's regarding Charlie Kirk. Which means this time it's not going to fly because I'm not going to allow it to. Let's take a pause here. We're gonna get to something that Megyn Kelly shared on her show about a hex that was put on Charlie Kirk—which is important for us to discuss for a variety of reasons.

And so another Charlie memory there for you. And now—things years later—and I'm reading ads for them on the show. Great people. I also want to remind you guys about the Wellness Company because it is flu season, which means it's also flu shot season. After everything we've been through over the past five years, the number of people that are getting the flu shot is at a record low. Yay. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is moderately effective at best—and that's not even accounting for all the vaccine injuries. There is a much better way to stay healthy. You can grab a Contingency Emergency Kit from the Wellness Company. ^t-00-28-31

It's like having an urgent care in your own home. I have a Contingency Emergency Kit, of course— got it from the Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line at an emergency room or to be relying on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. I simply open the kit, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and get right back to life. This kit is literally a lifesaver, with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So you can head to TWC.health/CANDACE today.

I think—I guess he was—it was a little time-out for Jimmy Kimmel. I was very shocked to see people on the right who were kind of cheering on his cancellation. And I'm not denying the logic of it—going, "This has happened to so many people on the right." So when it happens to you, boo-hoo. I get that. But also if we just keep playing ping-pong, nobody wins—and actually, except for the government.

And by the way, both sides have been guilty of government overreach, so less of us taking the bait on that. I also want to say—I wanted to show you guys this clip of Megyn Kelly. It's gone pretty viral. It's everywhere—speaking about something that I did not know about, which is pertaining to a hex and a curse that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Erika (Erika Kirk) were worried about.

They wanted to hurt him in some way. They declared, quote, "If the far-right misogynist with a bad haircut wants to villainize independent women, Jezebel is more than happy to be the hag of his nightmares."

People that don't believe in spiritual forces were probably just like, "LOL." It's like Vice. It's like, you know, Vice publication. Like, "You know, I smoked a blunt and, you know, listened to the Beatles' music backwards." Like, it's like—they don't take that stuff seriously. So they're trying to be like, "Haha, funny headline." And the person who wrote the article about it said, "I'm not calling on dark forces to cause him harm." "I just want him to wake up every morning with an inexplicable zit."

"I'm going to reach out to you to pay for you to put a curse on Charlie Kirk." And that witch did that. And it brought—obviously, you can see—they were distressed by this. They consulted a Catholic priest—who I assume would have immediately conducted an exorcism that probably should have been done in the Latin Rite. But I feel like that's just something that people should know because until something happens to you spiritually, you tend not to believe in these things. And like I said, that's a part of this.

It's like they can sell us anything as reality. Like we are now in this culture of what C.S. Lewis refers to as scientism. As long as they say like, "It's science," it's not weird—then we don't realize it. No, I think these are spiritual forces. Like if a witch was like, "Ha ha, here's a potion. Take it." It works. You'd be like, "Oh, that's so crazy." "I don't believe in witch potions." But like a doctor can create something, and it makes you feel, and you're like, "Oh, of course," but this is like backed by science. It's like, "Okay, by any other name"—sort of a thing.

And I'm glad that the end result thus far of how it has impacted society—to watch Charlie Kirk be assassinated, even though we don't know who exactly was behind this—we know it was more than one person—is that people are going back to church, and that they had that instinct when they watched it. They suddenly realized, "Whoa, they got hit spiritually." Even if they hadn't been to church in years, I was getting comments: "I hadn't been to church in 20 years." "And for some reason, watching the death of Charlie Kirk made me know that I needed to go to church." That is at least one thing in this. And there have been other things that has made me very happy. Anyways, I want to make sure I have time for your comments because we do have book club tonight, and I'm going to build upon what we're speaking ^t-00-37-34

This book we're reading is very important. The Assault on Truth—and so much of rereading this book is reminding me of what is happening with Charlie Kirk and how we're being lied to about everything and how evil the people are that are doing the lying. It's an important book because you have to know what these people are capable of. First, I'm going to read a couple of sponsors: Home Title Lock. If you are a homeowner, you should listen to this because the FBI has been warning homeowners about a type of real estate fraud that's on the rise, which is title theft. This type of theft doesn't happen by breaking down your doors and stealing your stuff, but rather they use a one-page document, and they just forge your signature. It gets filed to the county. And if your title—which is the legal record of your home ownership—gets transferred out of your name, ^t-00-38-17

That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock so you can protect your equity and find out today if you are already a victim. If you use my promo code CANDACE at HomeTitleLock.com, you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock Protection—which provides 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes, and if fraud occurs, then their U.S.-based restoration team will spend up to $1 million to fix it. Again, that's HomeTitleLock.com—promo code CANDACE—or use the link below. Also want to tell you guys about American Financing because the Fed has finally dropped interest rates, and that is good news for American homeowners. ^t-00-38-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=2382" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:39:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-39-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Expenses have been a major burden on families. Wages are flat, prices keep climbing, and for many, the only way to make ends meet is to lean on credit cards. But that cycle of high-interest debt makes it hard to stay ahead. So if you are a homeowner, I want you to call my friends at American Financing. Right now, interest rates have dropped. Many homeowners are seeing options in below fives. Compare that to credit cards that are charging rates in the 20s or higher. There is an easy path to see how you can finally put your hard-earned equity to work for you. American Financing can help you pay off that expensive debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your budget under control. Their salary-based mortgage consultants are saving customers an average of $800 a month. And if you get started today, you may be able to delay your next mortgage payment. Take control. Call American Financing. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. ^t-00-39-42

Again, that's AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. All right, guys. Let's get into your comments. Reminding you: Shot in the Dark—we have another episode that's going up. We're going to go through the birth control. This might be the worst one. Nexplanon. I don't know if I'm saying that right because I never used it, but I said it right on the episode. Don't worry. Crazy backstory to how that came together. You need to know this stuff. We are fighting people that are evil, and their plans are to poison us and our offspring. If that sounds crazy, you just dive right into Shot in the Dark. And you guys will have book club in a little bit here. I might be about 10 minutes late to book club. I hope that's okay. ^t-00-40-27

You guys have been asking for that. Spanish YouTube is live. Candace Owens en Español. That's it: @CandaceOwensenEspanol. So happy hunting there. Okay, you guys. We also have some—it looks like producers' note here—we have some signed Blackout copies that are available 15% off on our website, CandaceOwens.com.

Warwick Spiller writes, the name of the Mormon Church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Okay, thank you. I'm correcting that. At different times, it says Mormon. Other times, it says Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But in the founder's story online, it says the Mormon Church. So thank you for correcting that. And you said, "Don't divide us." I wasn't trying. I genuinely wasn't trying to divide you. I just don't know. It was genuinely a mistake. Lighthouse writes, "Some feel that Erika (Erika Kirk) is faking her emotions." "I lost my four-year-old son suddenly in April." "Sometimes I felt so numb." "It's our body protecting itself from extreme grief." "I couldn't imagine having the world watch me during that time." "The pain is unbearable." Yeah, I've seen that. I think we just need to be a lot more gracious. ^t-00-41-55

And it means if we can't imagine it, then we have no idea how we would react. Nobody is supposed to be able to log online and see the person that they love being shot in the neck. The person that is the father of their children being assassinated and murdered—and going through those emotions and still having to get up and be a parent and— I imagine if it was me, I would probably turn into a robot. I don't need—I mean, there's—I'm thinking about how this impacted me, and I'm not his wife. He's not the father of my children, and I could barely even get out of bed. So I just—I can't imagine what she's going through. So I think that's very fair for you to say that. And I appreciate you saying that. Oh, by the way, I didn't see the last part of your comment—going back to the bee stuff. ^t-00-42-38

Thank you, Warwick Spiller, for providing that. Natalie writes: "Tip: my sister's neighbor is the daughter of a lady who sent the video to police of Tyler Robinson walking down a neighborhood street." "The media is leaving out the part—leaving out part of that video." "It also shows him changing clothes, and he is not alone." "There is a woman with him." Okay, Natalie, hi. Could you send that to me? Can you just write, "Hi, it's me, Natalie," in the tips inbox so I can get that immediately? Please send that to tips@CandaceOwens.com. Natalie, please. I am begging you. He was with a woman? What? ^t-00-43-22

Well, we only got the Caldera Engineering video. So that's very interesting. Please, please, please get me that video, Natalie. tips@CandaceOwens.com. Reagan writes: "I'm a former teacher who quit halfway through year five." "God opened my eyes to what the system is, and it's abusive." "To explain this to former colleagues, I've got to come with correct facts." "What resources do you recommend?" Well, I'd start with Inside American Education. I think that really does a really good job of illustrating what's been happening and why it's happening and what the ultimate goal is. And it's a terrifying read for parents. And we need to be—as I say—just as radical as they were when they established this system. ^t-00-44-08

"But we haven't seen anything from Charlie Kirk." "Also, thoughts on the resigned doctor?" Okay, well, we can get into psychology. I have a lot of thoughts about that. If you're in the book club and we're talking about the psychoanalytic community, I think it probably follows the same story of a relationship that was really close and then broke off because Sigmund Freud held on to—I can't really say. That's why we have the book club—but you know how the psychoanalytic community was started. ^t-00-44-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=2730" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:45:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-45-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** They were gaslighting people that were actually being raped. And then sometimes people that came up in that environment genuinely thought that they were being a part of you know, psychoanalytics and thought it was real. And then the scales fell from their eyes, and they realized, "Wait a second, you're protecting rapists." And those people were outcast. I think it could be that story with Carl. Aravik writes: "I truly admire you, not just for your courage, but for the way you investigate and uncover truth that others ignore." "You're the only voice I fully trust." "Thank God for you." Thank you so much. And thank God for you guys because you gave me the courage to do this—truly—with all the attacks that we have to endure from the mainstream media, ^t-00-45-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=2764" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:46:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-46-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** committing ourselves to truths—especially in a time like this when you're being attacked, when you're actually someone that's experiencing genuine grief and you've lost your friend, and you see what they do—how they don't care, and how they lie about that person. It's a lot. But trust in God, faith in His plan, His design—and also having you guys backing me up—makes all the difference. Brooke writes: "I love the story about you and your husband." "My grandparents met and were engaged three days later." "They were married 67 years, had seven kids, 24 grandkids, and as of today, 76 great-grandkids." Yes, it happens, okay? I don't know what to say to people. I read these conspiracy theories. I'm like, "I can tell you that it just happened." 18 days—that was it. We were engaged after 18 days—first time I laid eyes on him. And now we have four kids, and we are happily married. ^t-00-46-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=2809" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:46:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-46-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And I'm not saying everyone should get engaged after 18 days, but I am saying that we need to stop with the whole "date somebody for three years," you know? I think that's a little ridiculous. And that only is being—that's only due to, in large part, some of the more sinister motives of the feminist movement—which we can get into another time when I release my next, my sophomore book, which is coming out later this year. All right, you guys. I gotta jump off here because I've got book club in a little bit. I'll see you tomorrow. ^t-00-46-49
