It is Wednesday, and I have a lot for you today. Because you're not gonna be surprised to hear that the FBI is FBI-ing. That's what they do. And that's what they want<span id="event-event-2025-09-09-charlie-kirk-and-erika-consult-priest-to-counter-j-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-09-charlie-kirk-and-erika-consult-priest-to-counter-j.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> to happen with the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> case.

I gotta tell you<span id="event-event-2025-09-24-fbi-pressures-utah-authorities-to-close-charlie-ki-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-24-fbi-pressures-utah-authorities-to-close-charlie-ki.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> all about that.

The story's kind of unbelievable, but I think it's important to share—especially with the way that the FBI is traveling here, trying to shut this case down. And it is also somewhat related to another explosive story that I have for you today because do you remember <span id="ent-person-thomas-matthew-crooks-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-thomas-matthew-crooks.md">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a></span>?<a href="/events/event-2024-07-13-thomas-matthew-crooks-attempts-to-assassinate-trum.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a><span id="event-event-2024-07-13-thomas-matthew-crooks-attempts-to-assassinate-trum-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-2024-07-13-thomas-matthew-crooks-attempts-to-assassinate-trum.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-00-01

That story just got buried. Well, today we have some exclusive information about him. Never-before-seen footage of <span id="ent-person-thomas-matthew-crooks-t-00-00-45"><a href="/entities/person-thomas-matthew-crooks.md">Thomas Matthew Crooks</a></span>, and it's going to be just the beginning of our coverage regarding what we know. So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-45"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span>. Okay, so let's start with the breaking news. I don't even know if it's considered breaking news when it comes to <a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a>. ^t-00-00-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-01-30.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:30</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=90" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Look, I don't think it's breaking news. I think it's just the news. This is what they do. Well, I have it now on a very well-placed, authoritative source that the FBI is putting an absurd amount of pressure right now on the authorities in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-01-30"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> and also the rest of the government in <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a> to come out and say that the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-30"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> case is closed<span id="event-event-2025-09-09-charlie-kirk-and-erika-consult-priest-to-counter-j-t-00-01-30"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-09-charlie-kirk-and-erika-consult-priest-to-counter-j.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-08-27-jezebel-commissions-etsy-curse-and-hex-on-charlie-t-00-01-30"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-27-jezebel-commissions-etsy-curse-and-hex-on-charlie.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>.

They want <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s<span id="event-event-2024-01-01-utah-modernizes-its-state-flag-featuring-beehive-s-t-00-01-30"><a href="/events/event-2024-01-01-utah-modernizes-its-state-flag-featuring-beehive-s.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> assassination to be officially ruled lone gunman. It was a lone gunman that did that. Nobody else is involved. Now, why would they? Why would they want that, right? What are they saying at least to the authorities? ^t-00-01-30

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-02-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=133" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Are they saying like, "Hmm, this is the reason—"? I'm sure they're not coming out and being honest or saying something that might ring truer to us, the public, which would be them saying, "Well, we know who did this, and we want to protect those people, so close the case." What they're actually saying instead is essentially, "If you don't close the case against <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-13"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> and rule it a lone gunman, then it might mess up our prosecution against <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-02-13"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>." That feels a little bit to me like moral blackmail. "Hey man, we're not hiding anything, but we've got this guy, <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a>." "If you don't close this case, then it might harm our chances of locking this guy up." ^t-00-02-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-02-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=178" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Yeah. I'm sure. I am sure that they are being just moral. I'm sure they're telling the truth to the authorities. Now, I want to remind you guys. We should take a look at their current case against <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> to see if we should accept this narrative because currently there is absolutely no video which shows <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> firing the weapon or even taking aim at <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>. In fact, the individual who filmed the footage of the shooter on the roof—the lone video that exists of the shooter on the roof—also told me that he doesn't think that <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> is the guy. So how's that gonna work for an eyewitness account? ^t-00-02-58

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-03-42.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:42</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=222" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** When he reported the shooter on the roof to <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-03-42"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> on the campus, he was clear that the person was wearing an entirely different outfit than the ones that they're currently trying to claim that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-03-42"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span> wore on that day. Remember, <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a> was just supposed to be wearing a t-shirt and some jeans. He says, "No, he was in tactical gear." "The person that I saw was in tactical gear." Also, that eyewitness told me that that gun doesn't even match what I saw. And like I said, this individual definitively has experience with guns. He teaches people how to fire guns. ^t-00-03-42

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-04-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=262" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So according to him and what he observed, if he's going to be brought into this court case that they're saying they want to—you know, they don't bring charges against <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-04-22"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span>—he's gonna testify and say, "No, that doesn't look like the gun." "That doesn't look like the person." So how's this going to work? Also, according to the individual that told me this, regarding <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-04-22"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span> trying to push for this case closure, they also—<a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a>—don't even have any footage that explains how exactly the rifle in particular got onto the roof. That stuns me. That's stunning information, right? ^t-00-04-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-05-00.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:00</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=300" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** 'Cause all we have is, well, in the indictment, he dropped onto the roof at 12:15 PM. <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-05-00"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> just dropped onto the roof. I guess in our minds, we assumed on the basis of the picture that they released—the sole picture or set of pictures from the same moment—of him walking up the stairs. We assumed that he, like I said, stanky-legged it—the whole stanky leg all the way up onto the rooftop. That was our perception. But it turns out, according to my source, they don't know how the rifle got onto the roof. That's interesting. How are we bringing this to trial? ^t-00-05-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-05-35.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=335" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, regarding the bullet, the source says that it was too fragmented to match <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a>'s rifle, so they don't have even the bullet. And let us not forget that <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a> himself has not confessed to anything. And that part also didn't make sense. He said they brought him in. Bail bondsman puts up a million dollars. <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a>'s dad gets the sheriff friend to come over, and they say he did it, and the police come, and they say arrest him. They bring <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-05-35"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> in, but <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> doesn't confess? So how did you arrest him? Does that make sense? How could you make an arrest if you didn't have a confession? You would have to have evidence, and the evidence can't be "trust my dad, bro." ^t-00-05-35

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-06-18.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:18</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=378" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** If I just bring in a random person, I say, "Oh, look, Skyler just committed this crime," and Skyler says, "No, I didn't," and he doesn't confess, the police can't just make an arrest. You can't just arrest Skyler. Nothing is making sense at all. It has not made sense from the very beginning, okay? And that's because <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-06-18"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span> are involved. And I believe <a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a> know exactly what happened. In fact, I don't think it's a stretch of imagination when we examine history to assume that they maybe even had some foreknowledge on everybody. ^t-00-06-18

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-06-51.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:51</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=411" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Not everybody, obviously, because some people are trying to get the information out and are trying to figure out what happened. But we know that there are people that are a part of that apparatus who are terrible human beings—who we do not want ruling over us—and yet they do. So I'm just curious what exactly, how exactly they believe they are going to convict <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-06-51"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> on this. Oh, you know what? It's probably the <span id="ent-org-discord-t-00-06-51"><a href="/entities/org-discord.md">Discord</a></span> messages. I forgot, silly me. The <a href="/entities/org-discord.md">Discord</a>. I forgot. It was so explicit. How could we forget? Oh, Lance, oh, Lance, wherefore art thou, Lance? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. ^t-00-06-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-07-30.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:30</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=450" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And if thou wilt not, Lance, thee bullet, me, my handprint. It was me. It was me, my love. I did everything I carved. Do you remember, my love, when I was carving the bullets? Yes. Yes. Exactly. This time is when I did it. And these are the reasons, my <span id="ent-concept-maga-movement-t-00-07-30"><a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a></span> daddy, my love. Thou wilt not, my love. Cool. Cool story. Very cool story, feds. Kind of feeling like <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-07-30"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span>'s going to get off because they've got really nothing but prints. And from my sources, it's not the only set of prints that are on that gun. ^t-00-07-30

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-08-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=486" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** In fact, the only thing that I have heard that made sense—which did not come from our government, did not come from <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-08-06"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span>, did not come from the <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-08-06"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> government, but rather from the people that are on the ground, who believe that actually <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-08-06"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span> was just told to walk and drop off his gun at a neighboring house— that, for some reason, just feels like that might be honest and that was how he participated in this event. But we'll see, because I'm not going to let this go. So we'll see if <a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a> tell us to just dismiss it as they always do. You know, rather relatedly, something that I want to tell you: yesterday we had showed you a clip of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> discussing our friendship and how he was feeling morally blackmailed over it. ^t-00-08-06

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-08-46.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:46</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=526" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And in that same clip, he mentions a very fond memory that I have—that he was there when I met my husband. And he says, "It's a really fun story." And it is a fun story. It's actually a totally fun, crazy story of how I met my husband. Because it was—I had something that came over me, and that's the only way I can describe it. And I get all of the conspiracies online when people were like, "There's no way she, her and her husband got engaged after 18 days." That's exactly how it happened. I didn't know him. I never even saw his face 18 days prior. And I'm with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-46"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>. We're hitting the ground running. And I'm just like, I feel compelled that we must go to the UK. It was—when I say the most overpowering thing ever—I was like, "<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>, we got to go to the UK." "We got to go to the UK." "We should go to the UK." "We should go to <span id="ent-gpe-london-t-00-08-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-london.md">London</a></span>." ^t-00-08-46

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-09-31.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:31</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=571" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And he's like, "Man, why?" "Why do you want to go to <span id="ent-gpe-london-t-00-09-31"><a href="/entities/gpe-london.md">London</a></span>?" I'm like, "I don't know." "I just feel like we're supposed to be there." "I feel like we've got to be there for an event." And I did something that I had never done. I took <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-31"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s credit card, and I was like, "I'm going to find flights and just book it." And then you just figure out maybe it means you're supposed to start, you know, <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-09-31"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> UK. There's energy there. That was a part of his vision. He wanted <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> to be global. And he had had people that were interested in the UK. And so I actually am showing you this very old text message chain from that time between me and <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>, where I even picked—I never booked flights, looked at flights—but I booked these flights. And I was like, "Look, the flights are dirt cheap." From NYC to <a href="/entities/gpe-london.md">London</a>: $450 in coach or $1,200 in first class. And he's like, "Wow, let's book it." ^t-00-09-31

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-10-16.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:16</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=616" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** All right. We booked the flights, and then suddenly I realized the reason that I had this overwhelming feeling to be there was because I was supposed to meet my husband. And the only thing I can say is that it was an intuition. We describe it that it had to have been God. We just had no reason, no other reason to be there. And then <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-16"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> set up a speaking event with some people that had been interested, and sure enough, we were there to help <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-10-16"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> UK get set up. Anyways, this overwhelming feeling. I had never experienced something like that since, until about a week before—or actually 10 days before—<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> got assassinated. ^t-00-10-16

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw/t-00-10-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZWSsq8ZWzw&t=658" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And so I'm gonna explain that to you because you guys who watch this podcast might have realized something—that we took the show off air randomly for the first couple of days in September. So I will describe to you exactly what happened. You know, there at first was an elementary school shooting that happened at a Catholic school. And I was just concerned in a way that I had never felt so impacted. And I was going, something isn't right. Something is just not right.

And I did just a cursory online search, and some messages I found—which were not written by a teacher at the school, but someone who was adjacent to some teachers at the school—gave me pause for concern. In fact, explicitly what it was was a Polish underground symbol—like a Polish communist underground symbol—that nobody would have recognized outside of people who know what it meant. And I just sort of went, "Okay, that's weird." ^t-00-11-29

Like literally bees, in a way that the only way I can describe it to you is like—they were speaking about bees, but they weren't speaking about bees. It was very coded. And I'm going, am I going crazy, or do you think that all these people are really actually, quote-unquote, "bee farmers" or saying that they farm bees? What is this lingo that I'm not understanding? Why do I feel like it's related to students? I didn't feel good about it at all. ^t-00-12-14

They were kind of giving me the—you know—the thing that teachers do now when you ask any questions about what happens at the school, which is they make you think like, "Why do you want to know?" Like, "We just do whatever we want to do." It's like, "I don't know." My children are like five and four, actually. Parents should, of course, we need to be more involved. Like, how did we get here that we feel like we're crazy for asking questions about the hiring practices at schools? And the feeling just didn't go away. I can show you this actually because I was thinking—like I said to my husband—there is some weird underground. It's like I sense like imminent danger is coming. ^t-00-12-53

I'm like, "I don't know if this is drugs. I don't know what it is, but it's weird." And so in a sentence, I just said, "There's imminent danger coming, okay?" "It is relating to a school." "I think it's a communist underground, and I don't know why, but it has something to do with bees." Totally sensible thing to say to your husband. Oh, and we need to hire more security. And we did. We hired more security that very week. ^t-00-13-38

"She's got to wake up super early." But seeing her do it made me go, "My older sister. I was like, what is wrong with me?" "Of course I can do this." And again, this weight being lifted off my shoulders of like, "You don't get my kids." This whole system, this whole matrix—gotta send your kids to school so we can what? Indoctrinate them mentally.

And they were like, "You don't get to ask those questions." "What's wrong with you, Mom?" "Why are you so scared?" I'm like, "Okay, bye-bye." "See you never." "Don't make me think that I'm weird for being a mom, okay?" "Don't make me believe or try to sell to me this idea that we're sharing these kids." These are your students. These are my kids.

Obviously <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-16-32"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> lost his life.

And my gut is telling me that this was the thing—that the dread that I sensed that was coming out of school. And I had no idea. I am not a flag person at all. And then someone told me—and I was astonished—that <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-16-32"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> recently, extraordinarily, modernized their beehive flag. ^t-00-16-32

So in <span id="ent-date-2024-t-00-17-09"><a href="/entities/date-2024.md">2024</a></span>, they modernized their flag, but they've always been known as the Beehive State. And to be clear, it's not because they make honey. It's not because they have a high presence of bees. In fact, in terms of making honey or bee-related products, they rank number 24. It's actually the Beehive State. It relates to the <a href="/entities/org-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.md">Mormon Church</a>—the <span id="ent-org-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints-t-00-17-09"><a href="/entities/org-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.md">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a></span>.

So this sort of doom that I had about an underground happening—I was just like, totally freaked out. It's this. It's a Soviet symbol and the idea of making everybody into a worker bee. And whether you're on the left or the right, you should understand where the public school system comes from. It is shaped by Soviet ideology. I tell people a must-read book is <span id="ent-work-inside-american-education-t-00-17-52"><a href="/entities/work-inside-american-education.md">Inside American Education</a></span> by <span id="ent-person-thomas-sowell-t-00-17-52"><a href="/entities/person-thomas-sowell.md">Thomas Sowell</a></span>.

Kindergarten even—kindergarten—you're like, where does that word even come from? Well, it was established by the communists that tried to overthrow Germany and failed. In 1848, <span id="ent-person-margarethe-schurz-t-00-18-36"><a href="/entities/person-margarethe-schurz.md">Margarethe Schurz</a></span>—her family—came here, and those same communists wanted to make sure that they established kindergarten access to children.

They understand something that I think that we have maybe forgotten, which is that children are the most precious resource. The reason for that is because they are the future. One way or another, children are the future, okay? After <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-19-14"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s assassination, that feeling still did not dissipate. Okay, I understood the imminent doom that I felt—that was almost crippling—was clearly related to that event.

It's like, you know, <a href="/entities/org-vice.md">Vice</a> publication. Like, "You know, I smoked a blunt and, you know, listened to the Beatles' music backwards." Like, it's like—they don't take that stuff seriously. So they're trying to be like, "Haha, funny headline." And the person who wrote the article about it said, "I'm not calling on dark forces to cause him harm." "I just want him to wake up every morning with an inexplicable zit." So she's probably trying to be funny, to be fair—but contacted witches who are not trying to be funny. ^t-00-35-37

"I'm going to reach out to you to pay for you to put a curse on <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-36-18"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>." And that witch did that. And it brought—obviously, you can see—they were distressed by this. They consulted a Catholic priest—who I assume would have immediately conducted an exorcism that probably should have been done in the Latin Rite. But I feel like that's just something that people should know because until something happens to you spiritually, you tend not to believe in these things. And like I said, that's a part of this. They very much know what religion they follow—the numbers, the numerology. It makes sense to them, the people that are in control of this world. You should just be very cautious—very cautious—of that stuff. ^t-00-36-18

It's like they can sell us anything as reality. Like we are now in this culture of what <span id="ent-person-cs-lewis-t-00-37-02"><a href="/entities/person-cs-lewis.md">C.S. Lewis</a></span> refers to as scientism. As long as they say like, "It's science," it's not weird—then we don't realize it. No, I think these are spiritual forces. Like if a witch was like, "Ha ha, here's a potion. Take it." It works. You'd be like, "Oh, that's so crazy." "I don't believe in witch potions." But like a doctor can create something, and it makes you feel, and you're like, "Oh, of course," but this is like backed by science. It's like, "Okay, by any other name"—sort of a thing.

They suddenly realized, "Whoa, they got hit spiritually." Even if they hadn't been to church in years, I was getting comments: "I hadn't been to church in 20 years." "And for some reason, watching the death of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> made me know that I needed to go to church." That is at least one thing in this. And there have been other things that has made me very happy.

It's an important book because you have to know what these people are capable of. First, I'm going to read a couple of sponsors: Home Title Lock. If you are a homeowner, you should listen to this because the FBI has been warning homeowners about a type of real estate fraud that's on the rise, which is title theft. This type of theft doesn't happen by breaking down your doors and stealing your stuff, but rather they use a one-page document, and they just forge your signature. It gets filed to the county. And if your title—which is the legal record of your home ownership—gets transferred out of your name, ^t-00-38-17

That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock so you can protect your equity and find out today if you are already a victim. If you use my promo code <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-38-57"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">CANDACE</a></span> at HomeTitleLock.com, you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock Protection—which provides 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes, and if fraud occurs, then their U.S.-based restoration team will spend up to $1 million to fix it. Again, that's HomeTitleLock.com—promo code <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">CANDACE</a>—or use the link below. Also want to tell you guys about <span id="ent-org-american-financing-t-00-38-57"><a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a></span> because <span id="ent-org-federal-reserve-t-00-38-57"><a href="/entities/org-federal-reserve.md">the Fed</a></span> has finally dropped interest rates, and that is good news for American homeowners. ^t-00-38-57

Wages are flat, prices keep climbing, and for many, the only way to make ends meet is to lean on credit cards. But that cycle of high-interest debt makes it hard to stay ahead. So if you are a homeowner, I want you to call my friends at <span id="ent-org-american-financing-t-00-39-42"><a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a></span>. Right now, interest rates have dropped. Many homeowners are seeing options in below fives. Compare that to credit cards that are charging rates in the 20s or higher. There is an easy path to see how you can finally put your hard-earned equity to work for you. <a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a> can help you pay off that expensive debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your budget under control. Their salary-based mortgage consultants are saving customers an average of $800 a month. And if you get started today, you may be able to delay your next mortgage payment. Take control. Call <a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a>. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. ^t-00-39-42

We're going to go through the birth control. This might be the worst one. Nexplanon. I don't know if I'm saying that right because I never used it, but I said it right on the episode. Don't worry. Crazy backstory to how that came together. You need to know this stuff. We are fighting people that are evil, and their plans are to poison us and our offspring. If that sounds crazy, you just dive right into Shot in the Dark.

Warwick Spiller writes, the name of the <a href="/entities/org-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.md">Mormon Church</a> is The <span id="ent-org-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints-t-00-41-55"><a href="/entities/org-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.md">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a></span>. Okay, thank you. I'm correcting that. At different times, it says Mormon. Other times, it says <a href="/entities/org-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.md">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>. But in the founder's story online, it says the <a href="/entities/org-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints.md">Mormon Church</a>. So thank you for correcting that. And you said, "Don't divide us." I wasn't trying. I genuinely wasn't trying to divide you. I just don't know. It was genuinely a mistake. Lighthouse writes, "Some feel that <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-41-55"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> is faking her emotions." "I lost my four-year-old son suddenly in April." "Sometimes I felt so numb." "It's our body protecting itself from extreme grief." "I couldn't imagine having the world watch me during that time."

And it means if we can't imagine it, then we have no idea how we would react. Nobody is supposed to be able to log online and see the person that they love being shot in the neck. The person that is the father of their children being assassinated and murdered—and going through those emotions and still having to get up and be a parent and— I imagine if it was me, I would probably turn into a robot. I don't need—I mean, there's—I'm thinking about how this impacted me, and I'm not his wife. He's not the father of my children, and I could barely even get out of bed. So I just—I can't imagine what she's going through. So I think that's very fair for you to say that. And I appreciate you saying that.

Well, we only got the <span id="ent-org-caldera-engineering-t-00-44-08"><a href="/entities/org-caldera-engineering.md">Caldera Engineering</a></span> video. So that's very interesting. Please, please, please get me that video, Natalie. tips@CandaceOwens.com. Reagan writes: "I'm a former teacher who quit halfway through year five." "God opened my eyes to what the system is, and it's abusive." "To explain this to former colleagues, I've got to come with correct facts." "What resources do you recommend?" Well, I'd start with <span id="ent-work-inside-american-education-t-00-44-08"><a href="/entities/work-inside-american-education.md">Inside American Education</a></span>. I think that really does a really good job of illustrating what's been happening and why it's happening and what the ultimate goal is. And it's a terrifying read for parents.

If you're in the <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-44-45"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span> and we're talking about the psychoanalytic community, I think it probably follows the same story of a relationship that was really close and then broke off because <span id="ent-person-sigmund-freud-t-00-44-45"><a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a></span> held on to—I can't really say.

And then sometimes people that came up in that environment genuinely thought that they were being a part of you know, psychoanalytics and thought it was real. And then the scales fell from their eyes, and they realized, "Wait a second, you're protecting rapists." And those people were outcast. I think it could be that story with Carl. Aravik writes: "I truly admire you, not just for your courage, but for the way you investigate and uncover truth that others ignore." "You're the only voice I fully trust." "Thank God for you." Thank you so much. And thank God for you guys because you gave me the courage to do this—truly—with all the attacks that we have to endure from the mainstream media, ^t-00-45-30

It's a lot. But trust in God, faith in His plan, His design—and also having you guys backing me up—makes all the difference. Brooke writes: "I love the story about you and your husband." "My grandparents met and were engaged three days later." "They were married 67 years, had seven kids, 24 grandkids, and as of today, 76 great-grandkids." Yes, it happens, okay? I don't know what to say to people. I read these conspiracy theories. I'm like, "I can tell you that it just happened." 18 days—that was it. We were engaged after 18 days—first time I laid eyes on him. And now we have four kids, and we are happily married. ^t-00-46-04

I think that's a little ridiculous. And that only is being—that's only due to, in large part, some of the more sinister motives of the feminist movement—which we can get into another time when I release my next, my sophomore book, which is coming out later this year.
