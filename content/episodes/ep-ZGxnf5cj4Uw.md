Happy Monday, and get ready because we are going on a journey. I left you guys on the ultimate cliffhanger last week. I did not intend to, by the way. I genuinely wanted to get the information out as soon as possible that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> is not suicidal. And I'm going to tell you how I know that. Also, while investigating this assassination<a href="/events/event-2022-01-01-tyler-robinson-involved-in-car-accident-captured-o.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a>, there is a politician's name<span id="event-event-2022-01-01-tyler-robinson-involved-in-car-accident-captured-o-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2022-01-01-tyler-robinson-involved-in-car-accident-captured-o.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> that keeps coming up. And now he's apparently mad that we keep asking questions. I'm beginning to think that he might know something that he hasn't yet shared. So I wanted to kind of loop you guys into this and see what you think. Welcome back to Candace.<a href="/events/event-2022-01-01-tyler-robinson-involved-in-car-accident-captured-o.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a> ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-00-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=55" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span> didn't kill himself. <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> didn't kill himself. I mean, these are the phrases that we now use, and that we say when we expect that <span id="ent-org-the-federal-government-t-00-00-55"><a href="/entities/org-the-federal-government.md">the federal government</a></span> is telling us a lie. Last week, I have to tell you, I was contacted by a source who I vetted with information that answered a lot of the lingering questions that we've had about the investigation. Not all of them, but some of them—some of the big ones. First and foremost, we were like, how exactly did it work? How did <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> turn himself in, as we were told, but also never confessed? And did he actually author those absurd Fed messages? Because I'm thinking, no. ^t-00-00-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-01-38.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:38</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=98" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Lastly, what was he doing at Dairy Queen? Doesn't really quite fit into our timeline. Also, don't expect this kid who just tried out being a stone-cold killer to really have an appetite. And why exactly did the Feds withhold that information at Dairy Queen? And why are they allegedly stalking the Dairy Queen to see who comes in and out? Well, we have the story that could possibly, potentially answer all those questions, and it certainly makes a lot more sense than the slop that the government is currently trying to feed us. First and foremost, <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-01-38"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> has never confessed. They<span id="event-event-2025-09-28-phil-lyman-makes-unannounced-visit-to-uvu-student-t-00-01-38"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-28-phil-lyman-makes-unannounced-visit-to-uvu-student.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> acknowledge that he has never confessed to this crime, and he still is pleading innocence on the shooting. ^t-00-01-38

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-02-23.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=143" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** In fact, I was told that he was quote-unquote bewildered by the idea that he carved casings. I should be clear: he <span id="claim-claim-fb0c670cd476-t-00-02-23">does not dispute the fact that it is his gun at all. It is his gun, but <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-02-23"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span> is not<a href="/claims/claim-fb0c670cd476.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> exactly a gun enthusiast. He doesn't hunt like his other brothers do. In fact, he's apparently a fisherman. The reason that he has that gun in the first place is because it is in fact a custom-made family heirloom. <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a> is the firstborn son, so he inherited. That's what firstborns do. They get the family heirloom. That is why he has the gun. ^t-00-02-23

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-03-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=183" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** As many of you guys have noted, the <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> family appear to be conservative—hence the hunting and the fishing as the sports of their choosing. <span id="claim-claim-f274bbe7534a-t-00-03-03">I am told that they are fans of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-03"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and they are fans of <span id="ent-person-donald-trump-t-00-03-03"><a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Donald Trump</a></span>. Although<a href="/claims/claim-f274bbe7534a.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> this source noted that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-03-03"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span>, like many other conservatives have expressed, wished that <a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Donald Trump</a> would sometimes tone down his speech and his rhetoric. Now, on the topic of rhetoric, <span id="claim-claim-11c057fa8030-t-00-03-03">I am told that <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a> absolutely did not author those text messages. What text messages? He has no idea<a href="/claims/claim-11c057fa8030.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> where these messages came from. ^t-00-03-03

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-03-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=223" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He believes that they are therefore entirely fictionalized. It turns out—you're gonna be shocked—that he doesn't actually use words like “vehicle,” which should come as no surprise to anyone that has a brain. By the way, I'm sure you caught this, but there's old footage of <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-03-43"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> that is now circulating from a car accident that he had. And during the discussion with the officer that showed up, <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a> certainly refers to it as his car, not his vehicle, because that's how most English speakers refer to a car—unless they're in the military or on the police force. ^t-00-03-43

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-04-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=266" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So here is <span id="ent-date-2022-t-00-04-26"><a href="/entities/date-2022.md">2022</a></span> police body cam footage, in case you missed that, of Tyler making a crash report.

There's more, of course. Of most interest to me, what I've learned is that his father does not believe—his parents don't believe—that their son committed this crime. I was like, huh? Excuse me? That's a far cry from what the media has been telling us. Remember, the media presented this amazing story. The father realized his son was guilty, so it goes, right? And then he phoned over a friend to help him convince his son to turn himself in because this guy, you know, this mysterious guy was a friend and just had a connection with Tyler. And eventually they said, you've got to do the right thing here. We know this is you. ^t-00-04-48

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-05-32.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:32</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=332" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That was the vibe. Certainly that's what the media was putting down for us to pick up. Well, I was told actually that it was kind of the opposite. That quote-unquote family friend, who we learned was a former detective with the police force—and so therefore has strong ties with the police station—informed the family. It was that in-between person that informed<span id="event-event-2025-01-15-detective-mike-mitchell-retires-after-24-years-wit-t-00-05-32"><a href="/events/event-2025-01-15-detective-mike-mitchell-retires-after-24-years-wit.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> the family that Tyler had been identified as the shooter. He recognized him; he knows Tyler; he gives them the heads up. ^t-00-05-32

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-06-10.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:10</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=370" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And then I'm told—and I believe this—that the way in which he got arrested, or rather turned himself in, was because that family friend slash neighbor slash former detective told him, “Hey, it's best for you to turn yourself in because there's only one of two options here.” Either you turn yourself in and everything is peaceable, or the SWAT team could come in here and arrest you and things would get crazy. So that's what happened. He went over to their house. Tyler was called over. Tyler was bewildered. He disputed the idea that he had murdered <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. In <span id="claim-claim-ba2de940831b-t-00-06-10">fact, according to my source, Tyler has never even stepped foot on <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-06-10"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> campus.<a href="/claims/claim-ba2de940831b.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> ^t-00-06-10

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-06-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=415" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Tyler, it turns out—which has already been revealed—was accepted into <span id="ent-org-utah-state-university-t-00-06-55"><a href="/entities/org-utah-state-university.md">Utah State University</a></span>, not <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-06-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> Valley. And that's actually interesting if you pause and reflect on that, because we didn't really consider how on earth Tyler became not just familiar with the layout of the campus, but familiar with the rooftop layout of <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-06-55"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> campus— so familiar that he knew exactly how to scale across the rooftops to duck down in order to take an almost impossible shot at <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> who was sitting beneath a tent. How did he know how to do all of that? Had he been there before? That he knew where <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was going to be sitting in it, that he would have that shot from on top of the <span id="ent-org-lozier-center-t-00-06-55"><a href="/entities/org-lozier-center.md">Losey Center</a></span>? What? ^t-00-06-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-07-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=459" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I would actually—and I don't know—but I would imagine that even actual current <span id="ent-org-uvu-students-t-00-07-39"><a href="/entities/org-uvu-students.md">UVU students</a></span> don't know that possibility. Like, they're not even that familiar with how to scale the rooftops and what shots they can take from it. We'll see. Curiously, <span id="claim-claim-f99410180921-t-00-07-39">however, my source says that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-07-39"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> was nearby the campus on that day. I'm wondering if that fact—which I'm trying to learn<a href="/claims/claim-f99410180921.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> more information regarding—explains the Dairy Queen photo. Because what was he doing around the campus on that day? Where exactly was he around the campus on that day? ^t-00-07-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-08-21.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:21</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=501" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** This photo never made any sense. I plugged it into my timeline. It wasn't fitting in. So if you're wondering why exactly Tyler would agree to go to the police station if he's not guilty, ironically, the police were honest that day on one of the points. Well, first and foremost, that point is <span id="claim-claim-fa29df3200fe-t-00-08-21">Tyler is not suicidal. He wanted to go to the police station so that he didn't risk accidentally getting shot by<a href="/claims/claim-fa29df3200fe.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> the police swarming his home—as I said earlier—in a theatrical arrest setting. ^t-00-08-21

He will call each other. It's not unusual for me to get a call from him or vice versa. And at 8:02 PM, he calls me. “Hey.” I can tell his voice is kind of shaky. So my first thought is, who died? Who's he going to tell me that died? And then I couldn't fathom what actually came out of his mouth. So he said, “Hey, I know who <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-12"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s shooter is. I know the family through religious association.<span id="event-event-2025-01-15-detective-mike-mitchell-retires-after-24-years-wit-t-00-09-12"><a href="/events/event-2025-01-15-detective-mike-mitchell-retires-after-24-years-wit.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-09-12

So that was part of it. Part of the deal is Tyler knew it was just inevitable with all the law enforcement pressure that he—you know—his picture in the news, the gun on the news. He knew it was inevitable that he would be caught. He was fearful of a SWAT team hit on his house, or he was fearful of being shot by law enforcement. So part of the negotiation and getting him to bring himself in was that—that we would treat it as delicate and as soft as possible to make him feel comfortable to where he would show up at my office. ^t-00-10-41

It can't be both. Was he suicidal and wanting to die, or was he worried about dying? It can't be both. And I didn't catch onto that early on. The answer was he came in because he is not suicidal and did not want to get shot and was confused, as I am told. Now, you're probably wondering why the father and the mother didn't speak out to assert his innocence. That would make sense, right? Why don't you come right out and dispute everything immediately? Well, interestingly enough, <span id="claim-claim-f121e7c0030d-t-00-11-27">I'm told that it's because the Feds told them that if they spoke out, their lives could be at risk. Like they needed<a href="/claims/claim-f121e7c0030d.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> to keep things private, and they convinced the family to go into witness protection. Like, “Your lives are in danger. You shouldn't say anything. ^t-00-11-27

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-12-08.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:08</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=728" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Somebody could, like, you know, just come back and try to harm you guys because of what your son did. You should go into witness protection and don't speak to anybody. Trust us. We're the Feds, bro.” And they agreed, of course, in the fog of it all. Why wouldn't you agree? But then, like any good—maybe conservative—family, you start going, “I don't really trust these Feds. Like, I'm a little suspicious about the Feds.” Here's <span id="claim-claim-7ab35b948137-t-00-12-08">another point of interest, okay? His father had no idea that Tyler was gay. That's what I'm told. They are learning this in<a href="/claims/claim-7ab35b948137.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> and through the media. ^t-00-12-08

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-12-42.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:42</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=762" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** They thought that Lance was just his roommate, and they were especially shocked because apparently Tyler kept mentioning to them that he wanted them to meet some girl that he was seeing. Now, I would like to interject my own voice here and say that I think this girl was likely Lance, and Tyler was working up the courage to tell his family that he was gay. That is what is most likely, in my opinion, because we know for a fact that Tyler was in fact in a relationship with Lance—because we have exclusive photos, by the way; they're about to show you—that the two of them posted to their Instagrams. This is Lance posting Halloween-era photos: “I forgot to post. My boyfriend is the best. Love you.” ^t-00-12-42

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-13-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:13:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=802" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Don't worry; that handle has since been taken down of what Tyler's handle was, but he's got a handle that doesn't have his name in it, so he's maybe trying to hide this stuff. And then there's another photo of them. And this one's posted by Lance again: “Pics from when Tyler had a mustache.” You can see that they were in a relationship. Just makes sense that he was working up the courage to maybe tell his family about that. I was told also that Tyler is off-the-charts intelligent and always has been. We know this. He had a perfect GPA in high school. Now that is precisely what made the idea of him being so stupid as to author a full confessional via text messages pointedly absurd. ^t-00-13-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-14-01.md" class="timestamp-link">00:14:01</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=841" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Like, any person with a modicum of intelligence is gonna go, “I'm not gonna put this down in writing with every detail.” And apparently whoever authored those messages—likely Feds—didn't have a modicum of intelligence, or they would have maybe not <span id="claim-claim-3ab4f0dc5dd1-t-00-14-01">included every single detail there. The family says that the photo of the young man that is coming up the stairs—which was shared;<a href="/claims/claim-3ab4f0dc5dd1.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> that blurry image—is definitively not <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-14-01"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>. And let me just say, I never thought it looked like him—neither did you. Okay, face looks different; face looks more narrow. Also, that person looks taller. Every time I see it, I'm like, this person is taller than <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a>. ^t-00-14-01

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw/t-00-14-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:14:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGxnf5cj4Uw&t=883" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-14-43"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> also appears to have full lips—even though this image is blurry. We're not looking for someone that's got fuller lips. And <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> looks broader than that individual walking, right? So I'm on board with that person walking up the stairs. It's not <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a> because I feel like it was intentionally blurred. They also never gave us the footage at all because in order to blur it, they probably needed a static image. Also, the family believes that—and this is really interesting—<a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a>'s apartment was staged after his arrest. Now, you will recall that I spoke to Lance's family. And one of the things that Lance's family said was, “It was—hey, we own that apartment. They pay rent to us. We've never met <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a>.” ^t-00-14-43

And it's very strange that they immediately cleared Lance as a suspect. And I was told by other people in the department that they wanted to keep that raid very hush-hush. You don't want anybody to know about the raid? There was no mention of this raid, and Lance immediately gets cleared as a suspect. Why? Well, according to <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-15-27"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span>'s family, they went to that apartment after his arrest, and they felt the apartment was staged—and that intentionally in <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a>'s room a furry bed was placed—almost sort of implying that they're trying to transfer the attributes of Lance onto <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a>. ^t-00-15-27

But again, when I put together what I'm being told by Lance's family and what I'm hearing from the <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> family through a third party, I will say that it matches. It kind of seems like they're agreeing. One family is going, “Hey, Lance is kind of evil. Why is he getting—why is he getting cleared?” The other one's going, “<span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-16-10"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span>'s not this guy. <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a> is not this guy.” So what the hell is going on, guys?

Even in that press conference, by the way—<a href="/entities/person-nate-brooksby.md">Brooksby</a>—I don't like the way he's moving. I don't like the way <span id="ent-person-nate-brooksby-t-00-16-40"><a href="/entities/person-nate-brooksby.md">Nate Brooksby</a></span> is breathing. I got to be honest with you.

Why did you feel the need to explain to us earlier it's not unusual for him to call me—this guy—but I'm fortunate that information is in documents that he was—you know—formally working for me and working with me? What do you mean? If he was formerly working for you, that would mean he was a public figure, and this should be usual. Public figures—people that work for police departments—are always public, and their name is something we can easily research. It's nonsense. He's weird about this. He says that he retired. I think a journalist asks in the audience, like, you know, that former friend detective—how long has he been off the force? ^t-00-18-00

And it's—I feel—someone that we need to get in touch with. We've tried to <span id="claim-claim-fecd01febac6-t-00-18-41">get in touch with him. The name of that individual is former deputy <span id="ent-person-mike-mitchell-t-00-18-41"><a href="/entities/person-mike-mitchell.md">Mike Mitchell</a></span>, okay?

Now, oddly, despite a<a href="/claims/claim-fecd01febac6.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> career of 25 years in the police force, I can't find a single trace of him in old newspapers. So I'm looking for more information on this guy. I understand that he knows Tyler through the Boy Scouts. He's involved in the <span id="ent-org-lds-church-t-00-18-41"><a href="/entities/org-lds-church.md">LDS church</a></span>. ^t-00-18-41

We were able to confirm that this <span id="ent-person-mike-mitchell-t-00-19-22"><a href="/entities/person-mike-mitchell.md">Mike Mitchell</a></span> lives on the block— lives nearby, as was told via other sources. And thus far, we have only been able to even see a picture of him. It was just one picture or a set of pictures that we were able to find. And that again—which would mean <span id="ent-person-nate-brooksby-t-00-19-22"><a href="/entities/person-nate-brooksby.md">Brooksby</a></span> lied a little bit. I don't like a little bit of lies because you usually have to lie a little bit when there's something bigger that you're afraid of. According to this post, he retired last January. Here it is.

It's rubbing me the wrong way. All right, guys. Throwing it to some of our sponsors. I tell you all the time about Pre-Born because I've watched way too many people that are close to me be vilified for standing up for truth. That's what I do here—just standing up for truth—and I have felt that sting of media pressure and lies that are told. I've also felt something else, which is courage.

Here he is right here, and he was in the food court. I shared that photo because Nick had sent it to me into our tips box and said, “This person looks rather mysterious.

You said that in that footage is your driveway, and you parked there at 11:30 a.m. We know this footage that you're looking at was taken at 11:49 a.m., so you would have been on that street—that driveway—19 minutes before. ^t-00-28-49

Yeah, it's not my driveway. It's my aunt's driveway. Parking lot was very full. He's walking in front of my aunt's house there right now. My cousin's house is the driveway that is taking that photo, and my CR-V—the gray CR-V in the distance there—that is my car. I parked there probably 10 minutes before he walked by. And I had not seen this footage until just now. It just keeps—so many things that keep linking up. It's really astonishing to me. And then we went back to this house afterwards. ^t-00-28-59

So I took a friend of mine. We went back to my aunt's house and said, “Well, we'll just hang out here for a while.” And before long, the people were combing the backyard—as you saw. She had the footage of that. And pretty soon, helicopters are overhead. So this is very, very local to me. Not only is it <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-29-45"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>, but it's my neighborhood where I spent so much of my childhood and all of my relatives.

He says that he saw <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-30-28"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> that day. We're going to get to that. Also, when he says he grew up there and his family—I mean, his family owned—we were able to determine—one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 homes right there. Incredible, okay? Absolutely incredible. And that—his little press tour—obviously now you're like, you know, explaining your car was in the driveway. So the issue's close to him. That kind of makes sense.

He came off the roof. He walked up. He came up here to the parking lot, got in the car with an individual, and they drove away.” Well, that's not the story that came. It's that he escaped another route. And there are people who are coordinating this thing. I do not believe that that .30-06 that they showed—recovered in the bushes—was ever on the roof. I think it was in the bushes to start with. And now I'm not saying that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-31-28"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> wasn't on the roof. I'm not saying he didn't pull a trigger. I know I was in very, very close proximity. So another interesting thing—like I say—I left the front of the stage. I wanted to meet some of my friends and bring them down front. So it was clear at the east end. And I heard this loud boom. I heard this loud bang. And I turned around. ^t-00-31-28

What was that? And pretty soon some people started—you know—running. Everyone was trying to process. And I thought, this is a gunshot, and there's going to be more of them. I thought it could turn into a mass shooting. So I go to the people closest to me. Everyone's ducking down behind the concrete retaining walls, and some of them are still kind of oblivious. But there are two people that were standing there: two girls—very goth, very black, you know—and then I just walked. I stepped up to the side, and I said, “Did that not happen right here? Did you hear that? Was that right here?” They said, “Yeah, it was just right over there.” So they're confirming: yeah, the shooter—or wherever that sound came from—is right here. The thing that didn't really dawn on me is that they were not running. They were not frightened. In fact, as I stepped up, I heard one of the girls—and they were talking to each other— ^t-00-32-13

And she says, “Go F yourselves.” And like I said, I was not processing. I was trying to figure out what was going on. I thought this is a separate conversation. I don't know what it is. In hindsight, as I've watched that over and over, it's like these people were not afraid. ^t-00-32-56

So there's a part of me that's glad that I wasn't in close proximity, and part of me that feels bad that I wasn't there just in some form of moral presence and support.

Also, you know, he's a gubernatorial candidate. Makes sense. This would be a political moment to show that you're a leader. And look, life is not exactly an Agatha Christie novel, right? Where the guilty party somehow inserts himself into the investigation. So I park by the side; I keep pushing; and I'm following more public leads. But also, I do recall in the back of my mind that both Phil and <span id="ent-person-tiffany-peterson-barker-t-00-35-53"><a href="/entities/person-tiffany-peterson-barker.md">Tiffany</a></span> Barker—and as it would turn out, another person that lives on that street with the last name Shumway—kept trying to get me to look into <span id="ent-person-governor-cox-t-00-35-53"><a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a></span> because he's—according to <a href="/entities/person-tiffany-peterson-barker.md">Tiffany</a>—very supportive of the trans stuff.

He likes trans people. So it has to be him. Okay. Oddly, look: I'm just following the facts here. Nothing in my investigation has made me ask a question further about <a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a> on that day. Nothing came up organically. So I'm not going to push it just because he's a Republican— and actually where I was at in this process—what's that?

And I'm starting to think: is it possible that this is like a military hit? I don't know. I'd like to find out. Next came a tip that you guys saw me receive live on the show.

Okay. So <a href="/entities/person-ian-carroll.md">Ian Carroll</a> is conducting his own separate investigation.

And Nick tells me: he's like, “That's really weird now because we're like two weeks on from the shooting, and <a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a> lives four hours away.” So that's very, very gracious of him to do, but his energy isn't good. ^t-00-40-46

And this is why he's calling me panicking. He's like, “I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what's happening. I don't know why he's being so weird. I don't know why he's asking me questions about this investigation.” And I'm like, “Yeah, this is weird. This is very weird.” So then I'm like—I'm honing in here. I'm like, what's going on? I feel like he knows something, at the very least. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how I feel. And I begin actually searching through our tips box for anything related to <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-42-11"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span>. Maybe somebody else noticed something or knew something or he said something. And lo and behold—very early on— someone just messaged us and said, “Hey, like, you should probably ask more questions about <a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a> because every time I look into this investigation locally, him and his family members are popping up.” ^t-00-42-11

And that they found—you guys remember this—they found the Converse footprint nearby his grandma's house. And he presented a map—like, this is it. This is actually from his <span id="ent-org-instagram-t-00-42-52"><a href="/entities/org-instagram.md">Instagram</a></span>. He presents this map, and his nephew's name is Shane. And this—again—this was all public. I'm only looking at things publicly. And let's just look at some of these posts from nephew Shane. I mean, first and foremost, he's here; he's with his friends. ^t-00-42-52

I've been through this new experience for the last few days. I'm still very glad to have attended and to support <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-43-37"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and to see him.” The last pic shows Converse-brand footprints. And then he does hashtags, and here are him and the three friends. And by the way, I'm looking at the front on the right, and I'm like: I don't know. I'd like to know who that is, at the very least. And I'd like to know who everybody in this photo is. This is just interesting. Like, you guys are in the staircase and posting side-by-sides. Like they put the side-by-side photos of them in the staircase. And I just was like, I need to just know more about you. ^t-00-43-37

And they certainly hadn't liked the photo, or else I would have messaged them directly to figure out who they are. And yeah, I found that very strange. And so I messaged Nick, and I asked him whether or not he had ever received any images or videos from Phil directly. At the very least, we can see his line of vision so I can figure out where exactly he was when the shots rang out. And I'm wondering if we can maybe get some footage that we didn't have before when the shots rang out. And also, by the way, metadata is king. That's kind of been very—it's good to see because then I can put it in my timeline. That's why I love metadata. I can say this exactly happened at this time. ^t-00-44-22

He doesn't want to share those photos with Nick. And he asks him explicitly, “Whose side are you on?” Whose side are you on? I thought we were all on the same side. We're all trying to catch <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-45-07"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s killer one way or the other. You inserted yourself into this; got on the phone with me. I was not even trying to make any communication with you. I literally am just asking questions. And now all of a sudden it's like, oh, you don't want to answer any questions. You don't want to share anything. And he tells me that yesterday <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-45-07"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span> just calls him, and he shouts at him—“Who the F do you think you are?” kind of a deal—you know what I mean? Like, “Who are you to ask me for anything? I already gave my photos to <span id="ent-person-tayler-hansen-t-00-45-07"><a href="/entities/person-tayler-hansen.md">Tayler Hansen</a></span>.” ^t-00-45-07

I don't want you feeling uncomfortable in your own home. I would like you to just remove yourself entirely from the boots-on-the-ground elements of this investigation.” I don't think Phil is acting in a way that I perceive to be stable, given the fact that—again—he inserted himself in this investigation, and we're asking: this is my car on the street. Okay, you wanna be helpful. We're asking you to be helpful. And now all of a sudden you're showing up at 20-year-olds' houses, and you're being weird. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. And I said, I could reach out to Phil directly by myself. ^t-00-45-41

I reached out to both Phil and I reached out to his nephew Shane, and I asked for them to identify the guys in that photo. Like I said, I was interested in who those individuals were because I couldn't find them on his friend list. And in response, Shane immediately takes his profile private. And Lyman—<span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-46-26"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span>—leaves me on read. So I am now left in the predicament where I need to just ask the public. If you are one of those two kids that are in the photos there, I would love to ask you some questions since you publicized this tour. I mean, they even did the full video walking through where he walked. And, you know, he said—“My uncle”—he even posted; he posted <a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a>. ^t-00-46-26

This is the video that they posted. Everything was done publicly. And now I'm like, okay— maybe you have something that's helpful. I wanna ask you about: could you send me that photo? Could you send me that video? Could you send me all of this stuff? And now I'm getting radio silence. So unfortunately, because I need to figure out what happened on that day, I'm turning to the public to try to identify those people and anything else that you may know that may help put things together for us.

Anyways, you guys: I've given you a lot. A lot of weird stuff going on. Just need to know what on earth happened on that day. Let me get to some of your comments here. First, I want to tell you about American Financing because the Fed has finally dropped interest rates, and that's great news for American homeowners. Expenses have been a major burden on families. Wages are flat. Prices keep climbing, and for many the only way to make ends meet is to lean on credit cards. But that cycle of high-interest debt makes it hard to stay ahead. ^t-00-47-41

Many homeowners are seeing options in the low fives, and you can compare that to credit cards that are charging rates that are right now in the 20s or higher. There is actually an easier path. You can see how much you can finally put your hard-earned equity to work. It can actually work for you. American Financing can help you pay off that expensive debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your budget under control. Their salary-based mortgage consultants are saving customers an average of $800 a month. And if you get started today, you may even be able to delay your next mortgage payment. Take control. Call American Financing today. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210 or visit americanfinancing.net/Owens. ^t-00-48-25

All right, you guys: so what do you think? Is it weird for a gubernatorial candidate to arrive at a 20-year-old's house? Yes, I can answer that for you. That is weird. That is very weird. That was weird, okay? There's no way around that. And again, hopefully he will answer, and he will just send me some videos, and that will be—yeah—that'll be case closed, and maybe he doesn't want to help anymore. That's fine. But you can't insert yourself and then pretend you're under attack when people then go, “Hey, can you answer some basic questions?” Marzi is writing to us.

I actually did not know that at all. I'm super ignorant on the topic of ballistics and things that are actually done. That is—I never even heard about keyholing—so thank you for sharing that.

Christ is King.” And then my producer has a note that there are a lot of comments asking about the microphone theory. Here's what I will say about that. I—when I first saw the footage—thought as well that something came upward. But when I looked at image from the side, the microphone is still on him afterwards. It's like when you see it from—it looks like it kind of disappears. But then it kind of shifts when you look at the—when you look at the perspective slightly to the left; you see that it actually stays on him, and it's just in the fold. ^t-00-54-05
