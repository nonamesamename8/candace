Happy Wednesday. I don't know what these people thought. I don't know what they thought. I think they thought <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> would get assassinated. They would very quickly bury him in a yarmulke and then convince the world that he was actually besties with <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben Shapiro</a></span> and <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span>. He didn't even know <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. His last words before he died were, "Honor the Sabbath and buy <a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a>'s book." Yeah. And also, he had just written this Romeo and Juliet letter to <span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin Netanyahu</a></span> (Bibi). I feel like that was kind of the plan, but look, the best laid plans—they can fall apart. And I can tell you guys, this one is falling apart. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-00-40.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:40</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=40" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It is like an avalanche of truth that is just coming at the <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-00-40"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a></span> lobby because they were just sloppy in these lies, these post-mortem lies. Anyways, <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-00-40"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span>, okay? From the top ropes, she just swooped in and did something unexpected by slamming these people. Really, she didn't even try to slam them. She just told the truth. She produced video evidence of what <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-40"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> said to <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-00-40"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> backstage at the Student Action Summit in July. We're gonna get to that. ^t-00-00-40

Well, I always told you when they freak out, it's a clue. And now I know why they are kind of freaking<span id="event-event-2025-07-18-uvu-turning-point-chapter-requested-charlie-kirk-f-t-00-01-15"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-18-uvu-turning-point-chapter-requested-charlie-kirk-f.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> out, and I'm gonna tell you. So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-01-15"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. ^t-00-01-15

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-01-51.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:51</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=111" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, I'm excited for today, for the rest of the week, because we have got some very interesting updates for you in the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-51"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> assassination—the assassination that seems to have broken the brains of <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-01-51"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span>. They are not acting right. Can we all agree <a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a> are not acting right? They are panicking, panicking so much that they randomly sent <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-01-51"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben Shapiro</a></span> out into the daylight. And that, my friends—like I said—is a move, okay? Cersei would never send Joffrey Lannister into battle, right? And they just went ahead and did that. And he... lied to <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-01-51"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span>'s face. It is never a good idea to lie, full stop. Definitely not a good idea to lie to a woman's face. ^t-00-01-51

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-02-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=153" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And definitely, definitely not a good idea to lie to her face and try to humiliate her on her own tour. I personally would have strongly advised against it. Okay. I—if somebody said, "Is this a good idea?" I would have said, "Yeah, you know what? Let's maybe not do that." But it happened. And it's important to stress here that this was not just a simple mistake that Ben made, right? That's always a possibility—that Ben really thought maybe he saw something on <span id="ent-org-twitter-t-00-02-33"><a href="/entities/org-twitter.md">Twitter</a></span>. And somebody said, "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-02-33"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> just said that <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-02-33"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> murdered <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-33"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>," and then he gets on stage and he repeats it. Maybe it's just an accident. Highly unlikely, but of course you have to run that plausibility. But we can now confirm that that certainly was not the case. This was not a simple mistake because in the days following it, he didn't recant. ^t-00-02-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-03-18.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:18</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=198" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He did not modify. He did not correct. He has a platform. He could have just come out and said, "Oh, you know, I got the details wrong." Nope. This was a premeditated and a postmeditated lie. Okay. Intended to morally blackmail <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-03-18"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span> into a position to decide right now, on the spot, whether you are going to stand with evil <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-03-18"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, who was accusing <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-03-18"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> of murdering her own husband. And that lie backfired, gloriously. By the way, I think if it had been any other person—like if it was not <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a> who was sitting across from Ben—his strategy would have worked. That was the high-pressure, peer pressure. ^t-00-03-18

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-03-59.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:59</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=239" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** She happens to be extraordinarily media-trained, and she didn't—she didn't buck, okay? She looked uncomfortable, but... she did not bend to his will. She kind of just moved along and said some stuff about <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-03-59"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>, asked again, like, "Are you sure she said that?" And he says, "Yes, yes, she said that." And then she found out obviously that I did not say that. And the following night of her tour, during a Q&A section, somebody named Josh stepped up and asked her about that moment. And here is what <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-03-59"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span> said. ^t-00-03-59

My question is: during a recent stop, you had <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-04-35"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben Shapiro</a></span> as a guest, and he had made some claims about <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-04-35"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> saying that she had said certain things online. And when he made those claims, you looked visibly uncomfortable because you know you hadn't heard that and couldn't verify that. So my question is: why did you look so uncomfortable in that moment? And have you researched the claims that he made since? Thank you for that. ^t-00-04-35

**🎤 Megyn Kelly**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-05-02.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:02</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=302" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Megyn Kelly:** Yeah, no. He said that <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> has been claiming <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> was behind the murder of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, which I had not heard. And I was taken aback because that seems like something I would have heard. It's so crazy. And I have since learned it is not true. <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> has not made that claim. And in fact, I've now seen several clips of <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> specifically defending <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a> and saying she would never make a claim like that about <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> and that she is open-minded to other people at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span>. That's obvious. She's been making that point. I had heard that point. But she's specifically been defending <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a>. And she's been saying she does not think that of <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a>. And in fact, if you read her comments, she's under pressure to make comments about <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a>. And so far, what I've seen, she hasn't. ^t-00-05-02

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-05-47.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:47</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=347" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Megyn Kelly:** So thank you for that question. ^t-00-05-47

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-05-50.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:50</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=350" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I'll tell you right now, <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-05-50"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span> was not done. And I will say this: even if I remove myself from a situation, it is actually the most disrespectful thing that you can do to someone that you purport to be friends with or friendly with. I can't even imagine that—like, "Hey, will you join me on stage? I really like you, and I'm on tour, and I'd love to have you on stage for a discussion." And then this person starts coming after me and questioning my moral compass. Really process that. That's just not—that's just not cool beyond anything else. So I was pretty dumbfounded when <span id="ent-person-dave-rubin-t-00-05-50"><a href="/entities/person-dave-rubin.md">Dave Rubin</a></span> weighed in on the matter, and he called what Ben did—effectively trying to humiliate <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a> on her own stage— he referred to it as almost an act of bravery. ^t-00-05-50

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-06-35.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:35</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=395" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Take a listen to what <span id="ent-person-dave-rubin-t-00-06-35"><a href="/entities/person-dave-rubin.md">Dave Rubin</a></span> says. ^t-00-06-35

**🎤 Dave Rubin**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-06-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=397" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Dave Rubin:** All right, first off—again, I guess I'm glazing Ben right now, but he deserves it. It is not easy to go onto someone else's show in general when it's not a live audience and criticize them, but it's really not easy to do it when you're in front of thousands of people. I don't know how many people are at those shows, but it's certainly thousands. You can ask me. When thousands of people are there to watch <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-06-37"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span>, and then you have to criticize her a little bit, and he did it absolutely respectfully. And I think he did it properly. Listen, I don't care. ^t-00-06-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-07-09.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:09</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=429" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Dave Rubin:** Look, I don't—you can tell I don't really want to talk about <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-07-09"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>. I certainly don't want to talk about this Nick guy. But sometimes these things just hit you in the desk, and I agree with Ben. Like, I have a job to do, and if I don't address the things sometimes that I don't want to, then I'm probably not very good at my job, and you should watch another show. I don't really want to talk about <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-07-09"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. We were great friends for a long time. She has been to this house for dinner. She loves chicken parm. ^t-00-07-09

I have been to his house for dinner, and I do really love chicken parm. And I had a good one at his house. I will say that. I'm not gonna front. But the other part that he is saying here—I don't know what happens when you're a <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-07-31"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a></span>, where you just—on this one topic—and this was what it was with <span id="ent-person-dave-rubin-t-00-07-31"><a href="/entities/person-dave-rubin.md">Dave Rubin</a></span> and why I had to stop being friends with him or friendly with him—is like, they just don't know what it actually means to be a good friend. You do not—when you are invited to join somebody on stage— prepare a lie, right? Present them with a lie and try to peer-pressure them in front of their own fans. That's like—there are a million things that could happen before that ever comes to it. She did not invite him to have a debate. She invited him to come on her tour and to introduce—you know—to have him in front of her audience and to have a conversation about their values. ^t-00-07-31

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-MUA9ebCF4Ow/t-00-08-15.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:15</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUA9ebCF4Ow&t=495" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It's just not the right place, not the right time. And it really just shows that you're not a good person because you know she probably went backstage, okay, and said hello to him, was all friendly. If you want to take her to the side and said, "Hey, I wanted to have a face-to-face conversation with you." That's how like regular people would handle something like that. Not try to humiliate you on your own stage. That's just going to make <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-08-15"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a></span> upset. And <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a> does eventually do what I do when I get mad. I double down on the truth. Right. That is what I sentence people to: more truth. And it's fantastic—just be able to share more truth. And you don't have to be vengeful. You can just share more truth, and it's deeply upsetting to them. And that's what she does. She was literally trending all weekend. ^t-00-08-15

And <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-08-59"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> were claiming that's all a lie.

And I was fulminating and getting all red in the face—like I often do, to my shame—and I was mad thinking about this and thinking about the effort by the neocons in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-09-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">United States</a></span> to draw us into another forever war with <span id="ent-gpe-iran-t-00-09-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-iran.md">Iran</a></span>. Not a defense of <a href="/entities/gpe-iran.md">Iran</a>, of course. It's merely an acknowledgement that we've done this before. This happened in <span id="ent-gpe-iraq-t-00-09-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-iraq.md">Iraq</a></span>, which we entered into at the behest of those same foreign policy strategists, and it didn't work. ^t-00-09-46

I know, by the way, that <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-20-57"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>'s wife is one of the events directors. Now, I'm not saying that she does campus events because there's different departments. She might do the bigger events. But was she at all involved in planning this event? I want to know. She may not have been. I need to know, and I will know. ^t-00-20-57

The reason they gave them that they insisted on it was because they liked the place outside where <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-21-41"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> could pull up, where the vehicles would be able to pull up. Makes no sense. I have gone through an unbelievable amount of kitchens. Doesn't matter where you pull onto the event to speak at a college campus. You're always walking through a kitchen somewhere on campus. So the idea that they liked where they could park their cars—it's not tracking for me. Okay? It's just not tracking for me. ^t-00-21-41

I think you guys have emailed me and said that I'm pronouncing that wrong. I'm just gonna rock with Timpanogos. Now, we had wondered if perhaps the two hospitals shared information because that's a plausibility if you're using the same tech or maybe you're within the same healthcare system.

I could not agree more with you. It's actually the most important thing. That's why I said I'm not even voting until I know this because it is the undoing of everything. It's like we've just all just been veiled, and we just had not realized that we're now piercing through, and we're realizing that these monsters rule over us. Also, I see somebody in the live chat on <span id="ent-org-youtube-t-00-45-05"><a href="/entities/org-youtube.md">YouTube</a></span> wrote, "It looks like <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-45-05"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span> went to Oaks Christian in <span id="ent-gpe-thousand-oaks-t-00-45-05"><a href="/entities/gpe-thousand-oaks.md">Thousand Oaks</a></span>." That is correct. And the part that you're missing is that <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-45-05"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span> ran that school. He ran <span id="ent-org-little-oaks-t-00-45-05"><a href="/entities/org-little-oaks.md">Little Oaks</a></span>.
