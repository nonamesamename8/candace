I mean, you name it—they have an excuse. I think the correct answer is because the establishment is just in complete denial, left and right. What is happening is a populist movement. And what is happening is that we are really sick of <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionism</a></span>.

Just a general Hitler alert so we can keep track of the newest person who said something totally sensible and is therefore now being accused of committing a Holocaust. It would just be easier that way for me as an iPhone user. Today it is in fact <a href="/entities/person-brett-cooper.md">Brett Cooper</a>. So there's your update. And in <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-38"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk news, nothing is making sense still. Least of all, the request and the confirmation window regarding the <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-00-38"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> event. I'm gonna show you that. I brought the receipts today, as usual. So welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-38

The one they don't tell you about is when you get beyond all the stages. You've accepted that this person is not coming back. And then you just want to punch people in the face for lying about everything. I'm there. Everything they are telling us is crazy town. Okay. I wake up and I learn something new, and I get angry. I'm so angry. I'm taking it out on the team. I'm like, "No, this does not make any sense." I can't explain to you why it doesn't make sense because I've been through <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-01-33"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, but every little micro change is sending me in this moment.

I have been privy to. And that's why I said, "You know what? Let's actually scour through my emails." I was like, "Savannah, let's just go back so that we can share these things with the world—that you guys can join me in my frustration of wanting to punch somebody, anybody in the face, okay?" So yesterday we had mentioned to you that the timeline is absolutely absurd, okay? <span id="claim-claim-f355708f92df-t-00-02-10">The absolute absurdity of <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a>—as we learned—having received a request from <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>—I'm sorry—from <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> for <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> to speak on their campus in <span id="ent-date-mid-july-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/date-mid-july.md">mid-July</a></span>, okay<a href="/claims/claim-f355708f92df.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>?

And then they immediately approve that request, and they schedule it as his first stop some six weeks later<a href="/claims/claim-93eec35c619a.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. That has never happened in the history of my having done campus tours, okay? This was a tour stop. And you literally get these requests months before you start sorting through them. I mean, I'm gonna show you the real proofs that you can grasp how atypical the setup is, okay? <span id="claim-claim-c92e0bb690c5-t-00-02-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and I went on tour in April of <span id="ent-date-2024-t-00-02-55"><a href="/entities/date-2024.md">2024</a></span> together<a href="/claims/claim-c92e0bb690c5.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>.

I'm now going to show you an email of when we started planning that, okay? So keep in mind, in the back of your mind, this request for <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> came in in July, and they approved it for September. For my <span id="ent-date-april-2024-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/date-april-2024.md">April 2024</a></span> event, here is when we started planning. Here's an email, okay? <span id="claim-claim-f99c7ca69dec-t-00-03-39">You will note that this email came in October of <span id="ent-date-2023-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a></span><a href="/claims/claim-f99c7ca69dec.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. They told me, "Here are these events." As briefly mentioned, we're in the beginning stages of planning and requesting rooms for schools for next semester. For next semester—let me know. These are pending availability and approval: ^t-00-03-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-04-23.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=263" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** University of <span id="ent-gpe-north-carolina-t-00-04-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-north-carolina.md">North Carolina</a></span>, Chapel Hill—which I think we ended up doing—University of Pittsburgh, which I think we did, and the University of Alabama. We are talking about end-of-March and early-April events, okay? In October of <span id="ent-date-2023-t-00-04-23"><a href="/entities/date-2023.md">2023</a></span>. I am telling you guys, when we go back and we look at the calendar and we see that that request went out in <span id="ent-date-mid-july-t-00-04-23"><a href="/entities/date-mid-july.md">mid-July</a></span>, it drives me insane. It just screams at me that this was an inside job, okay? This was always a circumstance. This was not a special thing that happened. ^t-00-04-23

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-04-56.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:56</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=296" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** They would always say they would get requests in spring that they couldn't make happen, and then they would sort of roll them over and revisit those campuses—trying to hit all of the corridors of the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">United States</a></span> the following semester, which would be in the fall. They would go backwards. You don't instantly get approved for an event at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. It reeks of an inside job. That is how I feel. And the more that we learn about the story, the little changes that happen, the inexplicable things that we're learning—it becomes clearer and clearer that somehow, at some layer, at some stage, <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> is involved because they're giving us no clarity. Why? Why did this get approval so quickly? ^t-00-04-56

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-05-38.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:38</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=338" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The reason why they have to plan these so far in advance is because <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> travels like a madman, okay? He's not a person that has nothing on his calendar. And they can be like, "Yeah, sure. Let's just do this event randomly." The second thing that was driving me crazy as well—which was completely atypical—is the fact that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was slated to speak in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> on <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span> and then was... due to return just 10 days later to a different campus in <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a> that's under two hours away. That's not how they plan events. Okay, the idea is if you're going to fly and you're already going to be in that corridor, try to do those campus events back-to-back. We did <span id="ent-org-ucla-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/org-ucla.md">UCLA</a></span>, we did <span id="ent-org-berkeley-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/org-berkeley.md">Berkeley</a></span>, we did <span id="ent-org-stanford-t-00-05-38"><a href="/entities/org-stanford.md">Stanford</a></span>. You do a sweep overnight, over two days. ^t-00-05-38

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-06-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=380" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** You don't fly to <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-06-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> and then go back home to <span id="ent-gpe-arizona-t-00-06-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a></span> and then fly to <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a> 10 days later. Nothing is making sense, and we need to get to the bottom of why that is. This is looking to me—and you can let me know if you agree—it's looking to me like the apparent plan was to assassinate <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, who had at long last faltered on the pro-<span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-06-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> cause. Okay, his words, not mine. And then to stage a hostile takeover of his brand and of his legacy by pretending that his best friends in the world were like <span id="ent-person-susie-wiles-t-00-06-20"><a href="/entities/person-susie-wiles.md">Susie Wiles</a></span>. <a href="/entities/person-susie-wiles.md">Susie Wiles</a> and co. Somehow she made it onto the stage to eulogize him at this very public event. It's so publicized, we can't even doubt. ^t-00-06-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-07-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=425" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I mean, obviously—look who he's having speak. "Your job around the world is to now support this administration and this administration's efforts because we've turned this event into an effective Trump rally." It looks that way to me. Then they were going to tell Americans—as Pastor <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-07-05"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span> did— that it just so happened that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> kept notebooks and diaries. He was so diligent that he wrote down his <span id="ent-work-succession-t-00-07-05"><a href="/entities/work-succession.md">succession</a></span> plan featuring who he wanted to take over for the organization in the event of his untimely death. Like, you know, in the third notebook, he was like, "Oh, and if I accidentally get shot on campus, here's what you should do: call Eric Hub." And then after you call Eric Hub, come find this notebook. ^t-00-07-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-07-48.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:48</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=468" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And in this notebook, you'll see that I am using adjectives like "fantastic" and "heroic" to describe <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-07-48"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>. And if during this process of our imagination, common sense comes on and we're like, "Oh, but wait, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-48"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>—wasn't he like a boy genius? He's a pretty bright kid. Wouldn't he have maybe formalized that <span id="ent-work-succession-t-00-07-48"><a href="/entities/work-succession.md">succession</a></span> plan outside of like a diary? Maybe call one of his many lawyers, maybe formalize it in a will—because that's what you're supposed to do if you are thinking about dying and you need to make a plan: you make a will. I'm sure he had a will, but no—he wanted to put it in these notebooks. ^t-00-07-48

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-08-28.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:28</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=508" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And then the plan was to guilt us, I think—to try to haunt us with the ghost of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s) notebooks that were never going to be allowed to read, but we were supposed to accept that they most definitely read—like, for sure. That's what it feels like. Do you agree? I think their thought process was, "It will be much easier for us to control the spirit of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-28"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> than the actual living, breathing <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>."

I mean, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-30-36"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> has got to be one of the most disgusting folks whoever gets airplay on any major network." And this is actually not even the worst of <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>. No, she's an anti-Semite. That's quite a lot. Yeah, she's an anti-Semite. She's anti-gay. She's an anti-Semite. She has said stuff about the history of slavery in this country that's disgusting. Yes, it's funny insofar, you know, that—you know—her statements make no sense. But when we really get to the core of the issue, she's just a disgusting human being, and that's the bottom line. ^t-00-30-36

It's funny because they're being serious, and it's funny. "When we get to the core of the issue," yeah—she's an anti-Semite. Yes, she hates women. She hates Black people. "When we get to the core, she's just a disgusting person." All right, cool. Let's keep plodding along. Couple of updates on the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-31-13"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> Kirk story and something that is really bothering me in the back of my mind. Actually, a lot of things are bothering me, but here are two more things that are bothering me. <span id="claim-claim-d41a2e0f6402-t-00-31-13"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was never rendered any first aid immediately<a href="/claims/claim-d41a2e0f6402.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. I know the security team. I know that one of them is supposed to administer first aid immediately. We don't see that happening. I've seen everything from different angles. When he's down on the ground, they don't put any gauze on him. ^t-00-31-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-31-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:31:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=1915" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** They don't even put a hand where the wound is to try to stop the bleeding. In fact, when they pick him up, he is flopping all the way to the car. His neck is not even being held in a manner like they're trying to stop the wound from opening up. And something that really struck me as "What is going on?" is the fact that he was never even put on the ground after he fell from the chair, okay? I'm gonna explain this to you. Now, you know, I have the back footage; I have the side footage. And what you can see is that the first thing that happens is the security guard actually grabs <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-31-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. So <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> doesn't actually fall from the chair. <span id="claim-claim-9eb04bce93fe-t-00-31-55">The security guard<a href="/claims/claim-9eb04bce93fe.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> ^t-00-31-55

Obviously get low—unless you're <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-32-34"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>. When shots go off, you're supposed to get low. And so he puts him behind the table, but he guides him on top of a suitcase— an equipment suitcase, so to speak. I'm gonna show you guys that because no one has actually caught onto this. And at no point do they take him off of this, okay? So whatever—like 30 seconds pass—and it just strikes me as really odd that you wouldn't put him flat and straight, and then they're all kind of huddled over him on top of a suitcase—like an equipment box, so to speak. So here is this. I'm gonna show you that. Look—has anybody caught this? <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-32-34"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was never actually put onto the ground, and his head— ^t-00-32-34

He is not level. This entire time, as they are laying over him, they never put him on the ground. I find it very strange that those equipment boxes are even there. They're on either side of him, which is very strange. As far back as we could look, we couldn't see this sort of a setup. Everything is weird this day. And on the inside, they have these boxes. So I'm actually putting this out here because A, it's weird, but B, I am wondering— and maybe somebody can look this up so everybody is looking at different angles of footage— if they moved that box that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-33-18"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was on—if that box was moved before ^t-00-33-18

'Cause that's only about four minutes that passes, and I don't recall seeing that equipment box in the aftermath. And it's just weird they kept him on it. Like, that's just not even in common-sense scenarios. If I was there and I was not being paid millions and millions of dollars to secure the venue like these individuals were—I, annually, I would know that you have to get a body flat to administer any sort of aid, to assess things. It's—I don't know what they're—I actually don't know what they're doing for about 20 seconds, for about 30 seconds down there. I don't know what they're doing. They seem to be huddled up doing what? Doing what exactly are you doing? If you are not securing the wound, if you're not even trying to get his head level—what are you doing? ^t-00-33-58

You gotta do something. They don't even open their bag to try to administer any aid. And they're paid millions of dollars per year to do that. Anyways, the second thing—if you have that footage, if you can see if that box is moved—I would like to know if that box is still there four minutes later when they start taking down the equipment. Second thing that is bothering me—or, you know, one millionth thing that is bothering me— is <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-34-42"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>'s instant phone call. We've already discussed it. It's strange, okay? They're definitely lying about the fact that he's covering his ears because I just saw more footage, and he never stops this move for a single second. ^t-00-34-42

So still holding—and maybe thinking, what? It doesn't make any sense, okay? Anyways, I have been sort of not wanting us to engage in setting aside our common sense. Obviously, the excuses that we have been given—none of it makes. The excuses make even less sense, actually. And the excuse that we were given about what <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-35-24"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a></span> was doing is like running in the back of my head. <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-35-24"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span>, who was there—he's also carrying on <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-35-24"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s show. And he was pretty fired up about people asking questions about what <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> was doing. ^t-00-35-24

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-36-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:36:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=2182" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** The shooting occurs. I am next to <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-36-22"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a></span>. Both of us hear a loud crack. We both turn. We both see <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-36-22"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, who has been shot. Both of us, I think at about the same time, realize that that means there is a shooter who is on the scene. And, you know, you just hear the crack. So you don't know: did it come from far away? Did it come from close? Is there a mass shooter unfolding right now? So I and him both had the reaction of, "Let's get out of here before we are both shot." That is not us abandoning <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> had a security team. They all leapt immediately into action, and they got <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> out of there—which was what their job was to do. My job was not to get in the way and screw this up because I had to be a hero. That was not my job. ^t-00-36-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-37-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:37:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=2225" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** I remember even running—past both of us going past the—you know—the SUV that we came in on—and me thinking, "Should I get in that car?" And then thinking, "No, that's a really stupid thing to do." And then I kept going. So I was not with <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-37-05"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a></span>, or I don't remember being with him. I think I was ahead of him as we left, and we get out, and I run for— it must have kind of been more than 15 or 20 seconds. And then I realized there hasn't been another shot. So the shooter is likely detained or stopped or something—not in immediate danger. I pause; I look around me, and I see <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a>. And I see <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> there, and I'll never—truthfully, I will never forget what I saw because I've seen <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> almost every day for the past two years. I know his personality very well. ^t-00-37-05

He's a very happy guy almost all of the time. And I'll never forget what I saw because it was clear in the moment that he was profoundly freaked out. What I'll always remember is the way his lip was quivering—which I'd never seen before. And you very rarely see from someone that he was freaking out. And then I think he literally said to me—I might be imagining this, but I think what he literally said was—he was looking around, and then he says, ^t-00-37-49

And then he takes his phone, and he begins calling Erika. And I don't want to disclose how that call unfolded, but he did that. This—you know—your mind extends all of this, but that is happening within a minute of all of this occurring. I remember he calls Erika. I, around the same time, I pull out my phone, and I call my mom just to say, "Mom, there's been a shooting. You're going to see it on the news. I'm okay. Pray for me. I've got to go." And I remember that call. And around the time I put that phone away—and then he immediately calls his dad. He calls <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-38-18"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>. And he says, "Dad, someone shot <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-38-18"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. You need to call all of your pastor friends. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was hit. We need everyone to pray right now." ^t-00-38-18

And I guess it's very disgusting for me as someone who witnessed this—who saw <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-39-02"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a></span> hugely distressed and then step up in the moment. Because after that call was over, I saw <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> get total mastery of himself—that he realized he had to step up in this situation. And he from that point—he was like he was like a general directing a battle where he was—you know—grabbing people and saying, "Okay, we need to get to the hospital, and we need to do these things, and you guys need to wait here. I need to get in here to get information so that I can get it to Erika." ^t-00-39-02

Okay, so here is what is wrong with that. ^t-00-39-39

He doesn't dial, and he keeps it like this all the way past <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-39-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) car.

And he is on the phone already, and <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-40-37"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span> is nowhere to be seen. We can track those movements. We are told that within the minute of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-40-37"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> getting shot, he called both Erika, and he called <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-40-37"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>. And that's one of those little things that's really messing with me. Because the implication here is that the call with Erika had to be fast. The implication here is that the call with Erika had to be fast.

You're asking questions. There was a series of questions that need to be answered. You scream: "What do you mean? What are you talking about? Where is he? Where do I go? Blah, blah, blah." "Is he okay?" There are a litany of questions that would be asked. And please don't tell me that this is some situation where that wouldn't be the circumstance. I am so tired of the "you wouldn't know what you would do." I do know that you're asking a series of questions—which means naturally, if what he is saying is true— and until they reunited—which does not happen in our eyesight.

"Hey, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-42-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s) been shot. Gotta call you later." Like, 'cause I gotta call my dad and ask him to pray? By the way, that one too doesn't make sense. You could call your dad after you call 911. I mean, there's so many things that would happen before I called my dad and asked him to pray. If you're really gonna snap into it. And I know for a fact also that one of his first phone calls—it wasn't just two phone calls he made; he made three. 'Cause he also called <span id="ent-person-elizabeth-mccoy-t-00-42-01"><a href="/entities/person-elizabeth-mccoy.md">Elizabeth McCoy</a></span>, his wife, who screamed at the office. Okay?

Okay. They knew—that means they knew instantly where the hospital was. They knew which direction to go to. The communication that's flowing. I think Frank said he was on the phone while they were in the car with his family members. Don't quote me on that. So all of this happened.

If transparency would hurt the case, it's because you don't have a case. And if you're telling me that your phone logs on that day— your phone logs on that day—would somehow hurt the case. You are asking me to be an idiot, and I can't be an idiot. I can't pretend that I was born yesterday. You're lying. They're lying about the phone calls.

You have to start with <span id="ent-person-sigmund-freud-t-00-55-58"><a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a></span>, the early <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-55-58"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a></span> movement. Theodore Herzl, his connection to him—why they were connected. We talk about this on my <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-55-58"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>. Even if you can't join the <a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a>, you can still buy those books. And so I would start with "<span id="ent-work-the-assault-on-truth-t-00-55-58"><a href="/entities/work-the-assault-on-truth.md">The Assault on Truth</a></span>" by Jeffrey Masson, and then move on to this most critical book, which is "<a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a>'s and the <span id="ent-concept-jewish-mystical-tradition-t-00-55-58"><a href="/entities/concept-jewish-mystical-tradition.md">Jewish Mystical Tradition</a></span>." I think the combination of those two books are absolutely potent to the <a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a> narrative. I truly do. And you'll also start to recognize the psych tactics that they use on us—the gaslighting. That is why they celebrate <a href="/entities/person-sigmund-freud.md">Sigmund Freud</a>—because he mainstreamed gaslighting people that they harmed. ^t-00-55-58

And I don't know—I'm not a Jordan Peterson fan because I don't think he lived his life in the way that he inspired so many to live theirs. Obviously, that aside—complimenting my ideological disagreements with Jordan Peterson—I hope he gets well. And yeah, I'd have to look into how he got sick.

And you should never have perfect behavior if a situation is organic. That's the problem, right? They planned it perfectly. So this phone call and walking away is actually not what a natural person would do. Knowing what direction to walk into—you'd be all over the place.
