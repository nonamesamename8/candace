**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** All right, you guys. Happy Wednesday for some people in New York City. Mamdani won. Okay, that's kind of the big story. The Republican establishment—they have a lot of excuses regarding that win. The excuses are ranging from "because there was too much infighting on the conservative side" to "this country has been taken over by jihadists." I mean, you name it—they have an excuse. I think the correct answer is because the establishment is just in complete denial, left and right. What is happening is a populist movement. And what is happening is that we are really sick of Zionism. We are really sick of lies. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=38" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-00-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** In that same vein, in case you missed it, Brett Cooper is apparently the new Hitler—which I'm just wondering, can we just get these on iPhone alerts, like Amber Alerts? Just a general Hitler alert so we can keep track of the newest person who said something totally sensible and is therefore now being accused of committing a Holocaust. It would just be easier that way for me as an iPhone user. Today it is in fact Brett Cooper. So there's your update. And in Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk news, nothing is making sense still. Least of all, the request and the confirmation window regarding the UVU event. I'm gonna show you that. I brought the receipts today, as usual. So welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=93" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-01-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I'll tell you guys, there are a lot of stages of grief. The one they don't tell you about is when you get beyond all the stages. You've accepted that this person is not coming back. And then you just want to punch people in the face for lying about everything. I'm there. Everything they are telling us is crazy town. Okay. I wake up and I learn something new, and I get angry. I'm so angry. I'm taking it out on the team. I'm like, "No, this does not make any sense." I can't explain to you why it doesn't make sense because I've been through Turning Point USA, but every little micro change is sending me in this moment. It's a very personal thing. ^t-00-01-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=130" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-02-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I know how Turning Point operates their events—things that the world does not know. I have been privy to. And that's why I said, "You know what? Let's actually scour through my emails." I was like, "Savannah, let's just go back so that we can share these things with the world—that you guys can join me in my frustration of wanting to punch somebody, anybody in the face, okay?" So yesterday we had mentioned to you that the timeline is absolutely absurd, okay? The absolute absurdity of Turning Point—as we learned—having received a request from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—I'm sorry—from UVU for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to speak on their campus in mid-July, okay? Just a few weeks before he dies. ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=175" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-02-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** In mid-July, they get a request. "Can Charlie (Charlie Kirk) speak on campus?" And then they immediately approve that request, and they schedule it as his first stop some six weeks later. That has never happened in the history of my having done campus tours, okay? This was a tour stop. And you literally get these requests months before you start sorting through them. I mean, I'm gonna show you the real proofs that you can grasp how atypical the setup is, okay? Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I went on tour in April of 2024 together. We actually also split doing certain locations because they want to do as many locations all over the United States as possible. ^t-00-02-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=219" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-03-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And April of 2024 is when our campus events began. I'm now going to show you an email of when we started planning that, okay? So keep in mind, in the back of your mind, this request for UVU came in in July, and they approved it for September. For my April 2024 event, here is when we started planning. Here's an email, okay? You will note that this email came in October of 2023. They told me, "Here are these events." As briefly mentioned, we're in the beginning stages of planning and requesting rooms for schools for next semester. For next semester—let me know. These are pending availability and approval: ^t-00-03-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=263" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-04-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill—which I think we ended up doing—University of Pittsburgh, which I think we did, and the University of Alabama. We are talking about end-of-March and early-April events, okay? In October of 2023. I am telling you guys, when we go back and we look at the calendar and we see that that request went out in mid-July, it drives me insane. It just screams at me that this was an inside job, okay? This was always a circumstance. This was not a special thing that happened. ^t-00-04-23

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=296" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-04-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** They would always say they would get requests in spring that they couldn't make happen, and then they would sort of roll them over and revisit those campuses—trying to hit all of the corridors of the United States the following semester, which would be in the fall. They would go backwards. You don't instantly get approved for an event at Turning Point USA. It reeks of an inside job. That is how I feel. And the more that we learn about the story, the little changes that happen, the inexplicable things that we're learning—it becomes clearer and clearer that somehow, at some layer, at some stage, Turning Point USA is involved because they're giving us no clarity. Why? Why did this get approval so quickly? ^t-00-04-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=338" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-05-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** The reason why they have to plan these so far in advance is because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) travels like a madman, okay? He's not a person that has nothing on his calendar. And they can be like, "Yeah, sure. Let's just do this event randomly." The second thing that was driving me crazy as well—which was completely atypical—is the fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was slated to speak in Utah on September 10th and then was... due to return just 10 days later to a different campus in Utah that's under two hours away. That's not how they plan events. Okay, the idea is if you're going to fly and you're already going to be in that corridor, try to do those campus events back-to-back. We did UCLA, we did Berkeley, we did Stanford. You do a sweep overnight, over two days. ^t-00-05-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=380" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-06-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** You don't fly to Utah and then go back home to Arizona and then fly to Utah 10 days later. Nothing is making sense, and we need to get to the bottom of why that is. This is looking to me—and you can let me know if you agree—it's looking to me like the apparent plan was to assassinate Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who had at long last faltered on the pro-Israel cause. Okay, his words, not mine. And then to stage a hostile takeover of his brand and of his legacy by pretending that his best friends in the world were like Susie Wiles. Susie Wiles and co. Somehow she made it onto the stage to eulogize him at this very public event. It's so publicized, we can't even doubt. ^t-00-06-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=425" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-07-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I mean, obviously—look who he's having speak. "Your job around the world is to now support this administration and this administration's efforts because we've turned this event into an effective Trump rally." It looks that way to me. Then they were going to tell Americans—as Pastor Rob McCoy did— that it just so happened that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) kept notebooks and diaries. He was so diligent that he wrote down his succession plan featuring who he wanted to take over for the organization in the event of his untimely death. Like, you know, in the third notebook, he was like, "Oh, and if I accidentally get shot on campus, here's what you should do: call Eric Hub." And then after you call Eric Hub, come find this notebook. ^t-00-07-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=468" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-07-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And in this notebook, you'll see that I am using adjectives like "fantastic" and "heroic" to describe Mikey McCoy. And if during this process of our imagination, common sense comes on and we're like, "Oh, but wait, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—wasn't he like a boy genius? He's a pretty bright kid. Wouldn't he have maybe formalized that succession plan outside of like a diary? Maybe call one of his many lawyers, maybe formalize it in a will—because that's what you're supposed to do if you are thinking about dying and you need to make a plan: you make a will. I'm sure he had a will, but no—he wanted to put it in these notebooks. ^t-00-07-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=508" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-08-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And then the plan was to guilt us, I think—to try to haunt us with the ghost of Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) notebooks that were never going to be allowed to read, but we were supposed to accept that they most definitely read—like, for sure. That's what it feels like. Do you agree? I think their thought process was, "It will be much easier for us to control the spirit of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) than the actual living, breathing Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." That's the vibe that I'm starting to get as I keep discovering all of these strange anomalies. ^t-00-08-28

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=545" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-09-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And in the spirit of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), in case you missed it, we're supposed to think that he would want us to be mad at Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson and that he would want us to stop speaking about his murder and to instead unite and to get behind and support what feels like a hostile takeover of his company and his brand and to commit ourselves further to the Republican cause, right? To do everything that we can to make sure that, well, Mamdani—as just one example—does not become the mayor of New York. Well, guess what? It looks like we didn't do that. ^t-00-09-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=584" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-09-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Looks like the plan maybe failed despite the billionaire bucks that were flowing into the anti-Mamdani campaign. He won pretty handily against Andrew Cuomo—which, like five minutes ago, the Republican Party was telling us he was unbelievably corrupt and that he should be in prison. And all of a sudden it was our duty to get the word out, to get people to vote for Cuomo somehow again. Bill Ackman almost personally ran against Mamdani, right? At times, he even demanded to have a debate with Mamdani—which I don't understand the context of why Mamdani would be debating Bill Ackman if he's not running against him. Point is, Mamdani won, okay? Bill gave $1.75 million, and Mamdani won—irrespective of the money that was donated against him. ^t-00-09-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=630" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-10-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Michael Bloomberg also gave money to a Cuomo-affiliated super PAC. He gave $8.3 million to stop Mamdani, and it didn't matter. The Airbnb co-founder, Joe Gebbia, gave $3.1 million. It didn't matter. The Tisch family gave $1.2 million. It didn't matter. Still Mamdani won. Why? Okay. If we're being honest, he probably won during the first mayoral debate. Okay. Just like if I reflect upon 2016, Trump (Donald Trump) kind of won in the first Republican debate because he was just kind of saying "F you" to the establishment, and it was pretty apparent. I want you to take a listen to this question. ^t-00-10-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=674" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-11-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** It's shocking, actually, if you've never seen this. This is a question that was asked to the New York City mayoral candidates about which foreign country they would visit first if they won. So to be clear, the question on its face makes entirely no sense, but this is how it was answered. Take a listen. (Clip of NYC mayoral debate) ^t-00-11-14

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=785" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-13-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** This is our country, you guys. That's it. You know what? I'm going to take my 19th trip to Israel. Oh, well, I'm going to take my first trip after my son's bar mitzvah. Oh, I was planning on stopping over on the way for our honeymoon. We were going to stop and just go to Israel and do whatever we could. It's ridiculous, and it's obvious. And the way that the establishment comes down—if you don't peddle those talking points—he says something totally normal. "Yeah, I'm going to stay here in New York. Why do I have to make a trip to Israel?" And he says, "I'd rather work with the Jewish New Yorkers that are here." That makes sense. Why are they all coming down on him? Why have all of our politicians, left and right, sold us out? Okay. Republican Party. ^t-00-13-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=829" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-13-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I will never forget during the presidential debates—they were all wearing. The majority of them. I think there was only Vivek Ramaswamy who was not wearing the Israeli pin. I'm like, "What are you—you're running for president of the United States. What are you doing wearing the Israeli flag as a pin on your jacket?" No one can answer these questions, and they do the same thing: "I love Israel more." "No, I love Israel more." "No, I love Israel more." Keep in mind, by the way, Mamdani won—and New York has the largest population of Jewish people of any city in the world next to Israel. So that says something, okay? And he still won. Now, did he get the majority of the Jewish vote in New York? No, but the exit polls are quite stunning. He got way too much of the Jewish vote in New York, I would say. ^t-00-13-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=870" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-14-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And I'm gonna bring in Mark in my ear to mansplain what we're seeing here on the exit polls. Mark, can you please mansplain? Yeah, as you can see, it looks like despite not winning the Jewish vote, he got a huge proportion of it. 32% is pretty insane for allegedly how anti-Israel he is. And even deeper in here, you can see that Israel was a factor in a lot of these people's votes. This is according to a CNN exit poll of about 4,700 people coming out. Really, it's an election for mayor of New York. I don't see what this has anything to do with that. Yeah. ^t-00-14-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=911" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-15-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I mean, it's just—this is just something. And I think it also speaks to when Norm Finkelstein was on our show, and he was explaining that even amongst the Jewish community, like the Israel question is now here, and it's not going to go away. It's not going to go away. This is sticking around. But I guess the bigger, broader question is: why didn't MAGA MAGA? Why didn't MAGA MAGA? Why didn't MAGA do the thing? We've infiltrated MAGA, and we told them to do what we want—and we wanted them to all make posts, anti-Mamdani posts. Just to be clear, even Donald (Donald Trump) Trump—President Trump—dedicated 900% more ^t-00-15-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=944" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-15-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Truth Social posts to ensuring that Mamdani would lose than to ensuring that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s murderer was found—900% increase in messaging coming from him, since he didn't even send one message about investigating Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s murder. But the question is: why didn't MAGA listen even to Trump (Donald Trump)? Why didn't we all get on our platforms and say something? Because people like Dana Loesch want to know: how are we going to win if you guys don't use your platforms and encourage people to vote? Well, the answer is pretty obvious. We don't recognize this MAGA because the fact that you're in it makes no sense. You were never Trump (Donald Trump). If you're telling us that MAGA is now Josh Hammer, then MAGA is not MAGA, okay? MAGA needs a new leader. ^t-00-15-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=987" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-16-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And it's pretty obvious that you guys recognize that—we have never been with you. We've actually never been on the same team. And if you think you're gonna infiltrate and convince us that this is the same party while we get gaslit about everything that's happening— like I said, you lost the party. MAGA got fractured—not when Tucker (Tucker Carlson) interviewed Nick Fuentes—but when Donald (Donald Trump) Trump looked at us in our faces and said, "Epstein who?" That's when it was game over because Israel-first is a cancer cell. It is a cancer cell, left or right, to everything and everyone that wants to play around with it. It is a radical psychosis that has manifested itself within both parties, and it is so radical. ^t-00-16-27

Brett Cooper—23-year-old, bubbly Brett Cooper. She makes the majority of her videos dedicated to pop culture. Yes, she covers things that are—I would say—mainstream politics. Nothing too daring. Never speaks about Israel. And she did her part, by the way. Zionists wanted her to do her part and encouraged New Yorkers to get out and vote against Mamdani. But it's not enough, of course—because this is a radical ideology. You give them 100%. You even say one critique, and they don't want to break bread with you—they want to destroy you. ^t-00-17-12

And she agreed with the majority of sensible people that demands to censor speech, to deplatform, is not only childish—it's also ineffective. It's also antithetical to what it means to be a conservative. So I'm gonna let you listen to what Brett Cooper said about Randy Fine. And let me know if you're just so offended that you think that she needs to be canceled and destroyed. Take a listen to what Brett Cooper said. (Clip of Brett Cooper) ^t-00-17-51

He's the same guy who bragged about not washing his hands after he had a handshake with Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu). He's repeatedly introduced bills to criminalize anti-Semitism, infringing upon free speech. I mean, he obviously—I'm sorry to say—but he obviously cares more about Israel than he does, you know, principles like free speech. So, buddy—like, my advice to you, Randy Fine—is just move to Israel at this point. Like, considering you had to go through anger management classes a few years ago, I genuinely think you would probably be happier if you just moved to Israel. And that's what I dig at him. That's just a fact. It's a nudge of encouragement. I want everybody to be happy. I want everybody to be healthy. I think you would be happier if you just moved to Israel. You could be over there singing songs with Mike Huckabee. Seems like pretty sound advice: ^t-00-18-27

I mean, these tweets from Ted Cruz—I'm going to read you next—are a great example of this. So just a month ago, he tweeted this. He said, "They don't kill you because you're a Nazi. They call you a Nazi so they can kill you." "Political violence is a left-wing phenomenon. Enough is enough. We need to shut it down." And then in response to Fuentes and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) this week, he tweeted this: "Trump's (Donald Trump's) bombing of the Ayatollah's nuclear facilities made the little Nazi mad." So now you're turning around, and you're calling somebody that you don't like a Nazi. You're doing this out of blind rage because you're so angry that the conservative base's attitudes are rapidly changing—that Nick Fuentes is getting national attention—so you have turned around in response. ^t-00-19-19

You might recall Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did this. He sat down with Gen Z and said, "I'm trying to tell them that they are pushing an entire generation away with their actions." But we know how they responded to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) doing that. They started calling him an anti-Semite. They started squeezing him up into the last moments of his life. They were making financial threats to him. And not just financial threats—they made good on those threats.

If you're Erin Wexler—here's an actual tweet. Okay: "White Candace—what is a Nazi then?" Like, what? How does that make any sense? Why are you calling Brett Cooper the white Candace (Candace Owens)? Like, why are you even thinking about the fact that Brett Cooper is white? Why do we keep seeing this recurring theme of Jewish supremacists constantly having to comment on white people?

It's a very powerful episode of "The Sean Ryan Show" because she tells her backstory, and you realize how much substance she has and the things that she lived through. She lived through a lot. This is somebody who had twin brothers, and one of her twin brothers dropped dead from a heart attack unexpectedly. And when she describes the dynamics of what they went through as a family—meaning things you don't think about—having an identical twin brother, and then one half of you—you're literally a split cell—dies suddenly.

And she effectively lost a second brother because of having lost the first brother and trying to come to terms with the fact that her family's never gonna be the same again—how it led to divorce, all of these things.

I've been speaking a lot about Riverbend Ranch because I absolutely love their steaks. They have black Angus beef that is famous for its great flavor. Riverbend Ranch has taken black Angus beef to a whole new level because over the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones and without antibiotics. And then every fall, the calves containing those elite genetics return to the Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in the lush mountain pastures. ^t-00-27-22

It's born in the USA, raised in the USA, processed right here in the USA. The meat is aged to perfection for 21 days. And then it's shipped directly from their ranch to your home.

In fact, when they pick him up, he is flopping all the way to the car. His neck is not even being held in a manner like they're trying to stop the wound from opening up. And something that really struck me as "What is going on?" is the fact that he was never even put on the ground after he fell from the chair, okay? I'm gonna explain this to you. Now, you know, I have the back footage; I have the side footage. And what you can see is that the first thing that happens is the security guard actually grabs Charlie (Charlie Kirk).

And at no point do they take him off of this, okay? So whatever—like 30 seconds pass—and it just strikes me as really odd that you wouldn't put him flat and straight, and then they're all kind of huddled over him on top of a suitcase—like an equipment box, so to speak.

It's—I don't know what they're—I actually don't know what they're doing for about 20 seconds, for about 30 seconds down there. I don't know what they're doing. They seem to be huddled up doing what? Doing what exactly are you doing? If you are not securing the wound, if you're not even trying to get his head level—what are you doing? ^t-00-33-58

You gotta do something. They don't even open their bag to try to administer any aid. And they're paid millions of dollars per year to do that. Anyways, the second thing—if you have that footage, if you can see if that box is moved—I would like to know if that box is still there four minutes later when they start taking down the equipment. Second thing that is bothering me—or, you know, one millionth thing that is bothering me— is Mikey McCoy's instant phone call. We've already discussed it. It's strange, okay? They're definitely lying about the fact that he's covering his ears because I just saw more footage, and he never stops this move for a single second. ^t-00-34-42

Obviously, the excuses that we have been given—none of it makes. The excuses make even less sense, actually. And the excuse that we were given about what Mikey was doing is like running in the back of my head. Blake Neff, who was there—he's also carrying on Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s show. And he was pretty fired up about people asking questions about what Mikey was doing. ^t-00-35-24

I am next to Mikey. Both of us hear a loud crack. We both turn. We both see Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who has been shot. Both of us, I think at about the same time, realize that that means there is a shooter who is on the scene. And, you know, you just hear the crack. So you don't know: did it come from far away? Did it come from close? Is there a mass shooter unfolding right now? So I and him both had the reaction of, "Let's get out of here before we are both shot." That is not us abandoning Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had a security team. They all leapt immediately into action, and they got Charlie (Charlie Kirk) out of there—which was what their job was to do. My job was not to get in the way and screw this up because I had to be a hero. That was not my job. ^t-00-36-22

And then thinking, "No, that's a really stupid thing to do." And then I kept going. So I was not with Mikey, or I don't remember being with him. I think I was ahead of him as we left, and we get out, and I run for— it must have kind of been more than 15 or 20 seconds. And then I realized there hasn't been another shot. So the shooter is likely detained or stopped or something—not in immediate danger. I pause; I look around me, and I see Mikey. And I see Mikey there, and I'll never—truthfully, I will never forget what I saw because I've seen Mikey almost every day for the past two years. I know his personality very well. ^t-00-37-05

He's a very happy guy almost all of the time. And I'll never forget what I saw because it was clear in the moment that he was profoundly freaked out. What I'll always remember is the way his lip was quivering—which I'd never seen before. And you very rarely see from someone that he was freaking out. And then I think he literally said to me—I might be imagining this, but I think what he literally said was—he was looking around, and then he says, ^t-00-37-49

And then he takes his phone, and he begins calling Erika. And I don't want to disclose how that call unfolded, but he did that. This—you know—your mind extends all of this, but that is happening within a minute of all of this occurring. I remember he calls Erika. I, around the same time, I pull out my phone, and I call my mom just to say, "Mom, there's been a shooting. You're going to see it on the news. I'm okay. Pray for me. I've got to go." And I remember that call. And around the time I put that phone away—and then he immediately calls his dad. He calls Rob McCoy. And he says, "Dad, someone shot Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You need to call all of your pastor friends. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was hit. We need everyone to pray right now." ^t-00-38-18

And I guess it's very disgusting for me as someone who witnessed this—who saw Mikey hugely distressed and then step up in the moment. Because after that call was over, I saw Mikey get total mastery of himself—that he realized he had to step up in this situation. And he from that point—he was like he was like a general directing a battle where he was—you know—grabbing people and saying, "Okay, we need to get to the hospital, and we need to do these things, and you guys need to wait here. I need to get in here to get information so that I can get it to Erika." ^t-00-39-02

He doesn't dial, and he keeps it like this all the way past Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) car. Think Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) coming in. Mikey goes straight past the car, and then he goes all the way to the left, and he never brings his hand down, okay? He's not covering his ears for that long—which doesn't make any sense. Blake might think he's telling the truth, but it's not a true account of what happened on that day, okay? I'll say that again. Blake might think he's telling the truth, so it is possible that Blake is not lying, okay? But it is not a true account of what happened on that day.

And he is on the phone already, and Blake Neff is nowhere to be seen. We can track those movements. We are told that within the minute of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) getting shot, he called both Erika, and he called Rob McCoy. And that's one of those little things that's really messing with me. Because the implication here is that the call with Erika had to be fast. The implication here is that the call with Erika had to be fast. I want you to imagine: you get a phone call from whoever saying that the person that you love most in this world—and the person that you are married to—has been shot.

You're asking questions. There was a series of questions that need to be answered. You scream: "What do you mean? What are you talking about? Where is he? Where do I go? Blah, blah, blah." "Is he okay?" There are a litany of questions that would be asked. And please don't tell me that this is some situation where that wouldn't be the circumstance. I am so tired of the "you wouldn't know what you would do." I do know that you're asking a series of questions—which means naturally, if what he is saying is true— and until they reunited—which does not happen in our eyesight. We do not see Blake and Mikey reunite when we track Mikey all the way straight down to the left. Okay. ^t-00-41-22

And then he's gonna call Erika, and I'm supposed to believe what? This was a 15-second phone call? "Hey, Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) been shot. Gotta call you later." Like, 'cause I gotta call my dad and ask him to pray? By the way, that one too doesn't make sense. You could call your dad after you call 911. I mean, there's so many things that would happen before I called my dad and asked him to pray. If you're really gonna snap into it. And I know for a fact also that one of his first phone calls—it wasn't just two phone calls he made; he made three. 'Cause he also called Elizabeth McCoy, his wife, who screamed at the office. Okay? And so we're not being told the truth. That's what I'm getting at. We are not being told the sensible truth. ^t-00-42-01

Like, you just dropped that news and keep it moving? Or was he already on the phone with Rob McCoy? What happened? Okay, I need clarification because every day that goes on, it feels to me like Turning Point is engaged in a cover-up. And there's no other way to say this. There was no other way. I don't care who at Turning Point tweets. I literally do not care. I will breathe fire on all of you. I know how these events work. Why was this event confirmed so quickly when it was requested so late? Answer these questions. I need answers to these questions to understand what happened on that day.

Okay. They knew—that means they knew instantly where the hospital was. They knew which direction to go to. The communication that's flowing. I think Frank said he was on the phone while they were in the car with his family members. Don't quote me on that. So all of this happened. You instantly got to the hospital—which, by the way, the hospital was put on lockdown when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) came in. That's what we were told. They let Mikey and the Turning Point boys in. Maybe that's true. It sounds like it is true. Obviously, we know that you were there when they came out and said that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had died—according to Blake Neff and according to Frank Turrek's testimony.

Because that's the BS they're selling us right now. Like, "Transparency would hurt the case." And like I've said: if transparency would hurt the case, then it's because you don't have a case, okay? If transparency would hurt the case, it's because you don't have a case. And if you're telling me that your phone logs on that day— your phone logs on that day—would somehow hurt the case. You are asking me to be an idiot, and I can't be an idiot. I can't pretend that I was born yesterday. You're lying. They're lying about the phone calls.

I said I wasn't gonna do that, but I'm getting fired up again, okay? Now, I am hopeful that we're gonna get some more clarity in the future. And something else I wanna say—building on yesterday—the feeling I'm getting that they were positioning Mikey to be the new Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Well, here's another little fun fact. Obviously, after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, there were no new scheduled posts on his YouTube page—meaning, like, you know, on your YouTube page, there's the live section. That's where you guys are right now. They had the live videos of people at the memorial event. But in terms of like scheduled posts to go out—they didn't bring back his YouTube channel and start scheduling those posts until after the memorial event—which makes sense. ^t-00-44-54

And when they came back and began scheduling posts on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) channel, the first post they scheduled was Mikey McCoy's speech. It was a picture. I'm gonna show you this. Look—so it goes in order from bottom to top. So you see you've got Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Ben; you've got Charlie (Charlie Kirk); Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Jack Posobiec; you've got Charlie (Charlie Kirk); you've got Charlie (Charlie Kirk); and then it stops. And then when they bring the channel back—even before they put Erika's speech—they put Mikey McCoy and his wife. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. This stinks to high heaven. Okay. Of all the speeches you could have picked to put first, right? You could have picked JD Vance. You could have picked Trump (Donald Trump). You could have put Erika. ^t-00-45-37

Anyways, I am hopeful that some more points will be clarified tonight when the very anticipated interview drops between Jesse Watters and Erika Kirk. I will be watching. I am actually ecstatic to hear more from Erika. I know she's obviously been given that time to grieve, and I'm hopeful that she's gonna provide just a bit more sense to this entire situation.

They're jacking up the jihad rhetoric: everyone's a jihadist; Muslims are coming; the Muslims are here; Mamdani—there's a jihadist threat; something big is coming. And the Pentagon— like where the Department of Defense is housed—the Pentagon, which was implicated in 9/11—a lot of questions about what the Pentagon was up to, money, a lot of questions about the Pentagon— they have just given press passes. ^t-00-46-55

I'm not kidding. Check this out. Check out this headline. "Conservative activist Laura Loomer, a Trump (Donald Trump) ally, says she has a new Pentagon press pass." Now, this is of interest. This should be of interest to everybody. But you don't have to be a Laura Loomer hater or a Laura Loomer lover to know that Laura Loomer quite literally has psychiatric issues. Okay, she has been on multiple psych 5150 holds. She is the person who—in case you didn't know this—chained herself to Twitter when she got banned from Twitter. And she wore a Star of David. ^t-00-47-39

Okay, so she's living in a delusion that she's even Jewish. That was politically expedient for her to say that she was Jewish. She can't produce any bat mitzvah pictures because it never happened. No—bat mitzvah just never happened. She became Jewish. In essence, I suppose, for political reasons—and has gone so far in this identity crisis that she chained herself to Twitter headquarters and made it like a Jewish thing when they kicked her off of Twitter back in 2018. I don't even agree with the fact that they kicked her off. ^t-00-48-12

But you should know that our Department of Defense—for whatever reason—is signaling that she's an okay person to be in the building. That just seems like maybe a flight risk. Like, if you're just interested in basic safety and defense, you wouldn't allow that person in a building like the Pentagon specifically. And they're doing that why? Because she has proven over and over again that she has no soul, and she will lie over and over again on people, on places, and on things that she sees with her own eyes—as long as she defends the state of Israel, which has absolutely nothing to do with her and her ethnicity—which is insane, okay? ^t-00-48-57

So what I will say is: your best guard against this is just to refuse to fight in the war that I think they're foreshadowing. Just refuse. Refuse. Honestly. On a principle: refuse.

We drink it every morning, and honestly, I cannot imagine starting the day without it. And it's not just about the taste—it's because the coffee stands for something that we deeply believe in. Seven Weeks Coffee is America's pro-life coffee company on a mission to fund the pro-life movement—one cup of coffee at a time. They're called Seven Weeks Coffee because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean. At the same time, a heartbeat is clearly detected at an ultrasound. ^t-00-53-06

Margaret writes: "Pastor McCoy makes me feel very uncomfortable. Something very evil emanates from this man. He does not have a good face." I agree with you. Like I said, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) always said, "The eyes are the window to the soul." I look at him, and I know that everything is wrong. I just know that everything is wrong. Steven Forker writes: "Candace (Candace Owens), I've been a supporter of Trump (Donald Trump) since 2016, but after Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) death and the complete lack of transparency—is this still the same Trump (Donald Trump) that Charlie (Charlie Kirk), you, and millions of others voted for and believed in?" Absolutely not. And like I said, it was before Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) death. Then the mask-off moment for me—that we had been completely occupied—was when he said, "Why are we still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?" ^t-00-54-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=3313" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:55:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-55-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** A story was released later that he was protecting some of his donors—and that's the problem. You know, that's his vice. Trump (Donald Trump) loves money, and it looks like he has sold his soul for money. That's the reality. And they're not going to convince me that I have the support and administration that wants to gaslight me about a person who harmed children, okay? Not gonna happen. John Diamond writes: "Dear Candace (Candace Owens), if we are in The Matrix—and we are—you are Morpheus. All you offer is the truth, and a personal thank you for helping the scales fall from my eyes regarding Israel. As always, love to you, George, and your kids. Christ is King." Indeed He is. And look—we all wake up at some point. I'm grateful if people have learned from my show. I hope that people will challenge themselves to read the books because you can't ^t-00-55-13

You have to also recognize what Israel—how it came together. You have to start with Sigmund Freud, the early Zionist movement. Theodore Herzl, his connection to him—why they were connected. We talk about this on my book club. Even if you can't join the book club, you can still buy those books. And so I would start with "The Assault on Truth" by Jeffrey Masson, and then move on to this most critical book, which is "Sigmund Freud's and the Jewish Mystical Tradition." I think the combination of those two books are absolutely potent to the Zionist narrative. I truly do. And you'll also start to recognize the psych tactics that they use on us—the gaslighting. That is why they celebrate Sigmund Freud—because he mainstreamed gaslighting people that they harmed. ^t-00-55-58

Andrea writes: "Please help us locate the video of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk's entire answer to the first question that he was asked about Jesus Christ at Utah Valley. I had no luck finding the entire 8-to-10-minute clip. Only 20-to-60-second videos come up. It shouldn't be this hard to find." My producer made a note that it has made the rounds and that we have it. I think the best way to find that stuff is always on X. I really do think that there's a lot of people that share those things. So, yeah—I don't know how we would get that to you. Nicola writes: "I hope... ^t-00-56-42

Yeah, those are our resident Zionist friends. They're here every episode. Say hello to them. Intuition Jen writes: "Thank you for calling out TPUSA and holding them accountable." It really stinks. It does. And it won't survive. It won't survive this. If they are not forthcoming about what happened—if they are not forthcoming about why they had all these dramatic changes—who were the ops that were back home? Who was he on the phone with? There's no way he was holding—now that I saw the footage—all the way of him beyond—still on the phone. He does not dial a number, and he's on it for way too long. They're lying to us. ^t-00-57-24

Caitlin—and who are they protecting? Who are they protecting actually? Caitlin Carey writes: "Thank you for all that you do. What do you think about Jordan Peterson getting sick while in Israel?" It's hard for me to believe that someone that was smart wasn't waking up to—"I feel spiritually not right." That he's been MIA since right before they shot Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I did not know that he got sick while he was in Israel. I don't think if the implication here ^t-00-58-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=3514" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:58:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-00-58-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** is that he was shifting viewpoints—Jordan Peterson has actually been a stalwart on the topic of Israel. I've never even seen any daylight, a crack on that topic. And I—for me personally—found that it was unbearable because he was so hypocritical on this particular topic. And I don't know—I'm not a Jordan Peterson fan because I don't think he lived his life in the way that he inspired so many to live theirs. Obviously, that aside—complimenting my ideological disagreements with Jordan Peterson—I hope he gets well. And yeah, I'd have to look into how he got sick. We get very weird answers that don't provide a lot of clarity. So, I don't know. I really don't know what's going on with Jordan Peterson. I have no insight there. ^t-00-58-34

I think that's already happened actually—and I think it had been happening for a while—and I am looking to get some evidence of that for you guys. But I'm hearing some things. More is going to come out because we're not going to let this go. Raven writes: "Brandon Briggs said on his last day's show to pray for Candace (Candace Owens), Alex Jones, and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson—bold voices that are exposing darkness. May Jesus Christ of Nazareth protect them all." Thank you so much. And do pray. Pray, fast. These things work. And we are in a time of tremendous revelation—that is very clear—which makes it that we are in dangerous times. Times of tremendous revelation are times when evil becomes more desperate. ^t-00-59-19

And what's really funny— when I say funny, I'm talking dark humor funny— as I was recounting this with my team earlier, I said the problem with what they did is they planned it perfectly, right? And you should never have perfect behavior if a situation is organic. That's the problem, right? They planned it perfectly. So this phone call and walking away is actually not what a natural person would do. Knowing what direction to walk into—you'd be all over the place. You'd be freaking out, screaming, running towards the person. It looks like a military operation. Everything that we see looks like a military operation on that day. And that's the problem, right? ^t-01-00-04

Human behavior is lacking in this circumstance. And that's what makes us all uncomfortable. They want us to forget this. They want us to be ADHD about this. They want us to move on and start talking about the Mamdani race. And we have to be committed to not letting this go because we are getting close every day. We are going to increase the pressure on them. If this happened to me, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would be doing the exact same thing. I know he would be. This is a kind of evil that should scare everyone because the implications are that if this was in fact a military assassination, then there is— I mean, forget talking about a deep state—we are talking about a kind of evil ^t-01-00-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LATnak75Si0&t=3690" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:01:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-LATnak75Si0/t-01-01-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** which would be so far-reaching that even Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) own allies at his company and at the White House—some of them—would have had to be aware. That's the—obviously not all of them, but some of them would have to have been aware for this to be executed. And we sense that. We sense that in the lack of information that is coming out, the lies that are being told, the covering up of the 12 Israeli cell phones—because if it really was nothing, then it would be nothing. They would share that information. Instead, Kash Patel is frantic, and he's angry, and he's shouting at people—is what I'm hearing. So let's keep on it. "Expose the Truth" writes: "The clip of that mayor debate looks like an SNL skit." Indeed it does. "As a conservative-leaning libertarian, I don't agree with socialism, but part of me is glad that Mamdani won because it sends a message. ^t-01-01-30

Exactly right. And when you see that skit, it reminds us of early Trump (Donald Trump). Trump (Donald Trump) was on stage, and they were just hammering everything that he said, and he was really funny, and he stood by what he believed in—and we thought that he was going to disrupt the establishment. And now it looks like he's been swallowed whole by the same swamp that he went down there to clean up, okay? Whatever the swamp monster is, it's got some claws—is what I would say. It's got some claws. And so I feel let down—obviously—by Trump (Donald Trump), but it pales in comparison to how I feel about the entire Trump (Donald Trump) family—given everything that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did to get them to where they are. Like, their silence is just something else for me. Like I said, I'm not voting until this gets solved. ^t-01-02-14
