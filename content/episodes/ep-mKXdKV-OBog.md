Happy Friday. Some more interesting tips are coming in. It seems that that company, <span id="ent-org-satis-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-satis.md">Satis</a></span>—that <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> company—the <a href="/entities/org-satis.md">Satis</a> angle has opened up a whole new level of possibilities<span id="event-event-2025-07-25-satis-subsidiary-in-hamburg-germany-underwent-ceo-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-25-satis-subsidiary-in-hamburg-germany-underwent-ceo.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> here in this <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> assassination story. And I have to tell you, I do not think that they were just painting planes this year. Rather, we've learned that just before <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination, there was actually this joint military exercise—which was taking place—related exactly to where the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> yellow plane landed on its way to <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>. We need to definitely keep at it. <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> are mad. I don't know why this investigation really has set <a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a> off. ^t-00-00-00

So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. Okay, so that interview that I did with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> back when my show was on <span id="ent-org-prageru-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/org-prageru.md">PragerU</a></span>'s network is becoming increasingly prophetic. At the end of every one of those interviews, I would ask the questions from my viewers to whoever it was that I was interviewing. And this is the question that came in for <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, and this is how <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> chose to answer that question. ^t-00-00-43

(Clip from past interview with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-28"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>) Okay, who is—I already know this; you kind of retouched on this—your all-time favorite historical figure?

If you want to talk about someone who lived a full life, it's <span id="ent-person-julius-caesar-t-00-02-17"><a href="/entities/person-julius-caesar.md">Julius Caesar</a></span>: from conquering northern Germania, to surviving and winning a Roman civil war, to an unusual alliance and quelling a rebellion with <span id="ent-person-cleopatra-t-00-02-17"><a href="/entities/person-cleopatra.md">Cleopatra</a></span>, to eventually becoming—to ending the Roman Republic, to starting the Roman Empire, and then seeing the people that he benefited the most turn against him. I think there's something very tragic and very interesting about that. So I think it's one of the most interesting, and you could learn—if there's something to learn about humanity—you could learn it through the prism of <a href="/entities/person-julius-caesar.md">Julius Caesar</a>. ^t-00-02-17

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-02-52.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:52</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=172" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Man, that sure is something to hear him say that. The people who benefited the most turned against him. Gaius <span id="ent-person-julius-caesar-t-00-02-52"><a href="/entities/person-julius-caesar.md">Julius Caesar</a></span>—that is correct—a general who had rightfully earned the respect of the people for leading them through the Gallic Wars, a statesman, and finally a leader who in the end was betrayed and famously assassinated by the very people that he helped to build up: a conspiracy, a plot to murder him, which included a lot of people—politicians, of course, the senators, military men, close friends and confidants—the most infamous, of course, being <span id="ent-person-brutus-t-00-02-52"><a href="/entities/person-brutus.md">Brutus</a></span>. Now, some reports say that he viewed <a href="/entities/person-brutus.md">Brutus</a> as a son. That's how close they were. ^t-00-02-52

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-03-38.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:38</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=218" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Of course, that didn't stop <span id="ent-person-brutus-t-00-03-38"><a href="/entities/person-brutus.md">Brutus</a></span> from plunging the knife into him. 23 times <span id="ent-person-julius-caesar-t-00-03-38"><a href="/entities/person-julius-caesar.md">Julius Caesar</a></span> was stabbed by senators, and of course <a href="/entities/person-brutus.md">Brutus</a>, leading to the famed Shakespearean expression: "Et tu, Brute?" Et tu—you as well, you too? Wow, you have turned against me as well. Now, why was Caesar assassinated? Because—I don't know—he was too good, too adored, too respected by the people, thereby a threat somehow to the establishment, the establishment of politics. It doesn't like to see somebody come through the ranks and achieve what they perceive to be power that they can't control. ^t-00-03-38

The media keeps trying these weird ways to debunk them. And we're going to find out. I've been confident from the beginning that this was not going to be a <span id="ent-event-jfk-assassination-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/event-jfk-assassination.md">JFK assassination</a></span> story. We are going to figure out who that foreign dignitary was who went to 920 North King on the morning of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination—who flew from <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> and landed into <span id="ent-gpe-wilmington-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span>, on the morning of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination. It is a very important question that needs answering. Got to tell you guys that we received another email this time from somebody in the military who informed us about another piece that we were missing that could be crucial to this puzzle. ^t-00-05-02

The video—the only two videos that we have that were recorded allegedly of the shooter: first and foremost, the video of him running away after the shot—way too fast. If he was actually crouched down shooting—common sense—it's too fast. You couldn't be in sprint that quickly for anybody that's actually fired a rifle. You know that you can't go from a crouching position to a full sprint in a split second. Well, that video was recorded by a person that is in the ROTC. I hunted that person down—very strange. They didn't want to be involved and sent it through three people to release onto the internet. And then it is boosted. And that's the video that everybody sees. ^t-00-15-42

I believe with shooting in <span id="ent-gpe-ukraine-t-00-17-38"><a href="/entities/gpe-ukraine.md">Ukraine</a></span>, of all places. It's getting shady. And of course, our now infamous planes, <span id="ent-vehicle-su-btt-t-00-17-38"><a href="/entities/vehicle-su-btt.md">SUBTT</a></span> and SUBNT, are <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-17-38"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> military planes.

Have you guys noted this? Everybody that day—I know, look, everybody's liberal, and guys wear pink, and Abercrombie's a thing—but I have never in my life looked at—every guy seems to be wearing maroon. I'm like, "Who is this guy?" Oh, he's wearing a maroon shirt. Oh, he's wearing a maroon shirt. <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-18-21"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>—everyone's wearing a maroon shirt—as if they were told to wear maroon shirts to identify each other.

I don't think it's your go-to color for most men. In fact, it was so often that I was seeing this color that I reached out to my source at <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-19-03"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>, and I was like, "Maybe it's a school color. Maybe actually they're all buying shirts and buying T-shirts, and the school color for <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-19-03"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> is maroon." And he told me, "No, it's not maroon." So this feels like something that we shouldn't ignore. I did—I was able to track down a couple of episodes ago. I was telling you this Bush situation seems to be a little odd. People thought they saw somebody speaking to a bush. And I was able to determine who that person was that kind of comes out of the bush. ^t-00-19-03

Nobody in his family posted about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. You had a front-row seat, and you watched <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> die. And I guess no social posts about it—wasn't interested, maybe wanted to stay out of it.

So I am still working on that. But yes, he as well was wearing a maroon shirt. I think we need to pay attention to that as we widen our investigation because if I was the military, and the reason we didn't promote this event—and again, we're theorizing here—but the reason we wait to the very last second to put up posters about this event was because you didn't—because you actually did want to control who went there that day.

That's me if I'm running a military operation—which I feel like I know because I do run kind of a toddler military operation.

Because that's what I'm here to do. I'm not going to pretend that. I'm not pretending. I don't have the time to pretend that I have not been sent on a mission to destroy this legacy broadcasting institution. I'm here to destroy it. I'm here to make it a vessel of state propaganda." Which state? Well, we know which state. It's not <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-32-58"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>. It's to be a vessel of state propaganda.

She's going, "Why are there standards and practices? Why are they showing the Palestinian reach for the cookie when we blow their head off? Why are they doing that? Why are they asking these questions? Why are they saying this?" She's very, very much 100% on board. My job is to get rid of any independent voice at CBS.

I don't even understand why we have to go through this process. Just write the article; just do the propaganda. You don't have to reach out because we all know what's happening. Your job is just naked propaganda to convince us you're going to be the authority on blackballing certain people, writing hit pieces about them, making sure that they cannot function in this economy. This is the state. They are the state, and they want you to know. And like he said, it is not <a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a>. It is not the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-34-40"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">United States</a></span> that they are doing this for.

You have heard me speak a lot about <span id="ent-org-neemi-skin-care-t-00-35-24"><a href="/entities/org-neemi-skin-care.md">Neeme Skin Care</a></span>. I love what their three-step anti-aging routine has done for my skin, which is why I am very excited that <a href="/entities/org-neemi-skin-care.md">Neeme Skin Care</a> now has a complete body line as well. They have the Foundations Body Bundle. It's a simple three-step routine. You get the Botanical Bliss Body Wash, which gently cleanses with soothing botanicals; revitalizing sugar scrub to exfoliate and hydrate with vitamin C plus the coconut oil; and the restorative body lotion to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy. And just like the facial care, the <a href="/entities/org-neemi-skin-care.md">Neeme</a> body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients. And best of all, it's made right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-35-24"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span> by a company that is built on our values: faith, family, and of course, freedom.

Number one: this person writes, "Brigitte thought <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-37-26"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> forgot all about him." Yeah, I mean, look. I did not want to see the <span id="ent-gpe-france-t-00-37-26"><a href="/entities/gpe-france.md">French</a></span> angle. ^t-00-37-26

But you know, somebody that is this sinister in terms of harassing people, suing people, going after people who even discuss the truth of their history— like, that's a committed psychopath, you know? There's no shame there. And yeah, Brigitte's a gangster. Like, he's a gangster. There's no question about it. And the people that are sending us tips—like, we should look further into <span id="ent-org-satis-t-00-38-09"><a href="/entities/org-satis.md">Satis</a></span>. It is correct, by the way. We did look into that. Somebody had said that they did, in late July, have a CEO switch for one of their subsidiaries in <span id="ent-gpe-hamburg-t-00-38-09"><a href="/entities/gpe-hamburg.md">Hamburg</a></span>, Germany—which is of course interesting because that is where <span id="ent-person-jean-michel-jarre-t-00-38-09"><a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-jarre.md">Jean-Michel Jarre</a></span> disappears for a couple of decades and joins the military. ^t-00-38-09

And the CEO is an <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-38-54"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israeli</a></span>, and it's in <span id="ent-gpe-hamburg-t-00-38-54"><a href="/entities/gpe-hamburg.md">Hamburg</a></span>. There's a lot going on there with <span id="ent-org-satis-t-00-38-54"><a href="/entities/org-satis.md">Satis</a></span>. And like I said, we're information-sharing in the background, and we are definitely getting closer. I think Icarus is flying a little too close to the sun. If what we're hearing turns out to be true, it is going to be—well, transformative in all of the right ways—for our society and understanding just how evil and sinister this thing can be. Second biggest comment from yesterday's episode: "It was supposed to be you" is an insane thing to say to someone after an assassination. It was wild. It was gnarly. ^t-00-38-54

I was just physically sick from having watched <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-39-36"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination.

Unfortunately, I didn't even know—<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-39-58"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, it was just—I don't know. I am tremendously—if I could pat myself on the back for anything—it's that I came out the other side of that because it was meant to traumatize me, and it was traumatizing. But it was meant to render me, I guess, inefficient. And it actually now is tethering me to— I think a lot of us, right? Like they were supposed to, I guess, make us silent. And now we're realizing, "Whoa, we have to stop and drop the petty politics and recognize that there is something way more evil going on." ^t-00-39-58

Okay, to the hoodies: "I'll Go Max." When we solve this thing, we will do that. I wanna make sure we hit the max. Maybe we'll even have "Gone Max" or "Went Max." And happy birthday to Amanda.

So whatever that is that is sitting behind them— yeah, that's power. Okay. It's got to be generational power. That's not—that's not "Hey, I'm new here and trying this thing out."

I know people were saying that—like Valhalla used to be a program out in <span id="ent-gpe-new-zealand-t-00-42-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-zealand.md">New Zealand</a></span>. Guys, if you can look it up and figure out that it's a program in <a href="/entities/gpe-new-zealand.md">New Zealand</a>, it's not a good program, right? So that's like the most hopeful wish that I think all of us wanted to. I definitely looked at Facebook; I was like, "I just hope he's alive, and none of this is real." And I had to then contend with the fact that it's very real. And that was obviously in large part due to my contacts that saw <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-42-51"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s body and can't deny that.

Keep going. Max." Thank you guys. Lux Lulu writes: "Stand firm. We see the cardinal virtues in your reporting. What was done in secret will be revealed—especially thanks to your courage and the courage of all of you guys around the world." People have taken real risks—like that person did to tell me that a foreign dignitary was being brought to 920 North King. By the way, to their like false debunking, where they said, "Kettis' lawyer is in this office." So to clarify matters for you guys: first and foremost, there were parts that I did not read for a very specific reason. Secondly, my lawyer—as you guys know, watching the show—has always been Noah. And the way that lawsuits work is state by state; they have different laws. And so when we oddly got sued in <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-43-34"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span>, ^t-00-43-34

That's just how it works. So in every circumstance, in every lawsuit that I've been involved in, you will see that it's never Noah that's actually filing or listed on any of the paperwork for that reason. And it can vary state by state, but it's—I've always seen that to be the case. I was not aware of that before this letter—is what I will say. And I will—that is what I will say. I will say that right now because I think that is enough to say. ^t-00-44-19

If you're waking up to how things really work, show them love when you see them." Yes, and you definitely should do that because I think we're all seeing that the conspiracies are real left and right—by the way—that people were telling the truth at various times and that there is great tremendous evil; that much of this is a matrix; the system is rigged; it is not fair. And it can only stay rigged if we keep arguing with one another.
