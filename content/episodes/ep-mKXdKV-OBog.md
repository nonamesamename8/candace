Happy Friday. Some more interesting tips are coming in. It seems that that company, <span id="ent-org-satis-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-satis.md">Satis</a></span>—that French company—the <a href="/entities/org-satis.md">Satis</a> angle has opened up a whole new level of possibilities<span id="event-event-2025-07-25-satis-subsidiary-in-hamburg-germany-underwent-ceo-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-25-satis-subsidiary-in-hamburg-germany-underwent-ceo.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> here in this <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> assassination story. And I have to tell you, I do not think that they were just painting planes this year. Rather, we've learned that just before <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination, there was actually this joint military exercise—which was taking place—related exactly to where the <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> yellow plane landed on its way to <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>. We need to definitely keep at it. <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> are mad.

So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. Okay, so that interview that I did with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> back when my show was on <span id="ent-org-prageru-t-00-00-43"><a href="/entities/org-prageru.md">PragerU</a></span>'s network is becoming increasingly prophetic. At the end of every one of those interviews, I would ask the questions from my viewers to whoever it was that I was interviewing. And this is the question that came in for <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, and this is how <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> chose to answer that question. ^t-00-00-43

If you want to talk about someone who lived a full life, it's <span id="ent-person-julius-caesar-t-00-02-17"><a href="/entities/person-julius-caesar.md">Julius Caesar</a></span>: from conquering northern Germania, to surviving and winning a Roman civil war, to an unusual alliance and quelling a rebellion with <span id="ent-person-cleopatra-t-00-02-17"><a href="/entities/person-cleopatra.md">Cleopatra</a></span>, to eventually becoming—to ending the Roman Republic, to starting the <span id="claim-claim-5ba9f2b56a5d-t-00-02-17">Roman Empire, and then seeing the people that he benefited the most turn against him. I think there's something very tragic<a href="/claims/claim-5ba9f2b56a5d.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> and very interesting about that.

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-02-52.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:52</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=172" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Man, that sure is something to hear him say that. The people who benefited the most turned against him. Gaius <span id="ent-person-julius-caesar-t-00-02-52"><a href="/entities/person-julius-caesar.md">Julius Caesar</a></span>—that is correct—a general who had rightfully earned the respect of the people for leading them through the Gallic Wars, a statesman, and finally a leader who in the end was betrayed and famously assassinated by the very people that he helped to build up: a conspiracy, a plot to murder him, which included a lot of people—politicians, of course, the senators, military men, close friends and confidants—the most infamous, of course, being <span id="ent-person-brutus-t-00-02-52"><a href="/entities/person-brutus.md">Brutus</a></span>. Now, some reports say that he viewed <a href="/entities/person-brutus.md">Brutus</a> as a son. That's how close they were. ^t-00-02-52

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-03-38.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:38</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=218" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Of course, that didn't stop <span id="ent-person-brutus-t-00-03-38"><a href="/entities/person-brutus.md">Brutus</a></span> from plunging the knife into him. 23 times <span id="ent-person-julius-caesar-t-00-03-38"><a href="/entities/person-julius-caesar.md">Julius Caesar</a></span> was stabbed by senators, and of course <a href="/entities/person-brutus.md">Brutus</a>, leading to the famed Shakespearean expression: "Et tu, Brute?" Et tu—you as well, you too? Wow, you have turned against me as well. Now, why was Caesar assassinated? Because—I don't know—he was too good, too adored, too respected by the people, thereby a threat somehow to the establishment, the establishment of politics. It doesn't like to see somebody come through the ranks and achieve what they perceive to be power that they can't control. ^t-00-03-38

The media keeps trying these weird ways to debunk them. And we're going to find out. I've been confident from the beginning that this was not going to be a <span id="ent-event-jfk-assassination-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/event-jfk-assassination.md">JFK assassination</a></span> story. We are going to figure out who that foreign dignitary was who went to 920 North King on the morning of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination—who flew from <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> and landed into <span id="ent-gpe-wilmington-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-wilmington.md">Wilmington</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-delaware-t-00-05-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-delaware.md">Delaware</a></span>, on the morning of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination. It is a very important question that needs answering.

And he told me, "No, it's not maroon." So this feels like something that we shouldn't ignore. I did—I was able to track down a couple of episodes ago.

I love what their three-step anti-aging routine has done for my skin, which is why I am very excited that <a href="/entities/org-neemi-skin-care.md">Neeme Skin Care</a> now has a complete body line as well. They have the Foundations Body Bundle. It's a simple three-step routine. You get the Botanical Bliss Body Wash, which gently cleanses with soothing botanicals; revitalizing sugar scrub to exfoliate and hydrate with vitamin C plus the coconut oil; and the restorative body lotion to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy. And just like the facial care, the Neeme body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients. And best of all, it's made right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-35-24"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span> by a company that is built on our values: faith, family, and of course, freedom.

And the people that are sending us tips—like, we should look further into <span id="ent-org-satis-t-00-38-09"><a href="/entities/org-satis.md">Satis</a></span>. It is correct, by the way.

Somebody had said that they did, in late July, have a CEO switch for one of their subsidiaries in <span id="ent-gpe-hamburg-t-00-38-09"><a href="/entities/gpe-hamburg.md">Hamburg</a></span>, Germany—which is of course interesting because that is where <span id="ent-person-jean-michel-jarre-t-00-38-09"><a href="/entities/person-jean-michel-jarre.md">Jean-Michel Jarre</a></span> disappears for a couple of decades and joins the military. ^t-00-38-09

So that's like the most hopeful wish that I think all of us wanted to. I definitely looked at Facebook; I was like, "I just hope he's alive, and none of this is real."

By the way, to their like false debunking, where they said, "Kettis' lawyer is in this office." So to clarify matters for you guys: first and foremost, there were parts that I did not read for a very specific reason. Secondly, my lawyer—as you guys know, watching the show—has always been Noah.

That's just how it works. So in every circumstance, in every lawsuit that I've been involved in, you will see that it's never Noah that's actually filing or listed on any of the paperwork for that reason. And it can vary state by state, but it's—I've always seen that to be the case. I was not aware of that before this letter—is what I will say. And I will—that is what I will say.
