Happy Friday. Some more interesting tips are coming in. It seems that that company, Satis—that French company—the Satis angle has opened up a whole new level of possibilities here in this Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination story. And I have to tell you, I do not think that they were just painting planes this year. Rather, we've learned that just before Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, there was actually this joint military exercise—which was taking place—related exactly to where the Egyptian yellow plane landed on its way to Provo. We need to definitely keep at it. Zionists are mad. I don't know why this investigation really has set Zionists off. ^t-00-00-00

So welcome back to Candace (Candace Owens). Okay, so that interview that I did with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) back when my show was on PragerU's network is becoming increasingly prophetic. At the end of every one of those interviews, I would ask the questions from my viewers to whoever it was that I was interviewing. And this is the question that came in for Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and this is how Charlie (Charlie Kirk) chose to answer that question. ^t-00-00-43

(Clip from past interview with Charlie Kirk) Okay, who is—I already know this; you kind of retouched on this—your all-time favorite historical figure? Is it Milton Friedman, or is there someone else? ^t-00-01-28

Yes, whoever this is. Suzy from Buffalo, I'm so sorry. Yeah, exactly. It's amazing, right? That's the Mensa—I mean, it's—I'm kidding. Um, so I love the American Founding Fathers. Ben Franklin—I always really enjoyed—um, you know, I—George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson are—I think are too cliché. So one I really enjoy that I just love learning from is Julius Caesar. Um, I think he's one of the most ^t-00-01-47

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=137" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-02-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** interesting historical figures. If you want to talk about someone who lived a full life, it's Julius Caesar: from conquering northern Germania, to surviving and winning a Roman civil war, to an unusual alliance and quelling a rebellion with Cleopatra, to eventually becoming—to ending the Roman Republic, to starting the Roman Empire, and then seeing the people that he benefited the most turn against him. I think there's something very tragic and very interesting about that. So I think it's one of the most interesting, and you could learn—if there's something to learn about humanity—you could learn it through the prism of Julius Caesar. ^t-00-02-17

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=172" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-02-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Man, that sure is something to hear him say that. The people who benefited the most turned against him. Gaius Julius Caesar—that is correct—a general who had rightfully earned the respect of the people for leading them through the Gallic Wars, a statesman, and finally a leader who in the end was betrayed and famously assassinated by the very people that he helped to build up: a conspiracy, a plot to murder him, which included a lot of people—politicians, of course, the senators, military men, close friends and confidants—the most infamous, of course, being Brutus. Now, some reports say that he viewed Brutus as a son. That's how close they were. ^t-00-02-52

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=218" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-03-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Of course, that didn't stop Brutus from plunging the knife into him. 23 times Julius Caesar was stabbed by senators, and of course Brutus, leading to the famed Shakespearean expression: "Et tu, Brute?" Et tu—you as well, you too? Wow, you have turned against me as well. Now, why was Caesar assassinated? Because—I don't know—he was too good, too adored, too respected by the people, thereby a threat somehow to the establishment, the establishment of politics. It doesn't like to see somebody come through the ranks and achieve what they perceive to be power that they can't control. ^t-00-03-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=261" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-04-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Yeah, the Bible's very clear that there is nothing new under the sun, and it appears that history is present again. Judas, Brutus—in the future, when we are long gone from this world, who do you guys think is going to be the person remembered most for this act of betrayal against Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Not me, that's for sure. It's not going to be Candace (Candace Owens), okay? No one's going to be saying "Et tu, Candace? Et tu." I can tell you that right now in government, there is real panic. There is real discussion happening regarding the Egyptian planes. I was informed that yesterday evening ^t-00-04-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=302" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-05-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** because I'm getting the sense that they hold the key to solving Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. The media keeps trying these weird ways to debunk them. And we're going to find out. I've been confident from the beginning that this was not going to be a JFK assassination story. We are going to figure out who that foreign dignitary was who went to 920 North King on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination—who flew from Provo and landed into Wilmington, Delaware, on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. It is a very important question that needs answering. Got to tell you guys that we received another email this time from somebody in the military who informed us about another piece that we were missing that could be crucial to this puzzle. ^t-00-05-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=345" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-05-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Taking a more serious look into that one-hour layover stop when our yellow plane, SUBTT—the tail number—came into the United States on September 4th. You might recall it stopped for just one hour in Minot, North Dakota, which I learned has an Air Force base. It pretty much is just the Air Force base, by the way, before making its way onto Provo. And here I'm going to read to you that email that I received. It says, "Hi, Candace (Candace Owens), I am [blank]. One of the good ones—military member, one of the good ones. I think one of the keys to not overlook here is SUBTT's stopover in Minot, North Dakota. ^t-00-05-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=390" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-06-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Why stop there at all on the fourth? Why not fly direct to Provo? Not only does Minot have an FBI office, but it also has an Air Force base among other tenants. That Air Force base is home to the 891st Missile Security Forces Squadron, a combined military and civilian security force that had just come off of Operation Valhalla, a training exercise in Minnesota from the 24th to the 29th of August, where the security forces practice long-range shooting practice, among other things. Remember on September 12th when Kash Patel ended his press conference with quote, "Lastly, to my friend Charlie (Charlie Kirk), rest now, my brother. We have the watch, and I'll see you in Valhalla." ^t-00-06-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=433" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-07-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Yeah, very interesting thing to say. I don't believe in coincidences. That's how he ended the email, telling me to keep up the hard work. And so we investigated that, and that fact-checked true, right? Minot definitely is home to exactly what we are telling you. I didn't know anything, by the way, about the city of Minot. I can tell you that North Dakota in general is not a very populous state. Approximately 750,000 people statewide, okay? And in Minot, there are just 45,000 people, and that includes 5,000 people who are stationed there at the Minot Air Force. ^t-00-07-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=471" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-07-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And it is home, as he indicated, to a global command strike center, which has participation between various countries on joint exercises. And we can show you right here that in the weeks leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination—I mean, literally what he says—August 24th-29th, Operation Valhalla took place in neighboring Minnesota. So they took the Minot boys, and they took them over to Minnesota, and it included the military and—of note—the civilians. What's interesting: of note, civilians. And they trained from August 25th to August 29th. And we can read the details of that here. ^t-00-07-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=511" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-08-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And by details, I mean—this is what the public was told about what they were training for, okay? So this is on the Minot Air Force Base website. It says Operation Valhalla Strike was a week-long training where the 891st Squadron from Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota, traveled to Camp Ripley Training Center in Minnesota, August 24, 2024. The advanced training focused on air-based ground defense and nuclear security tactics—the bread and butter of the squadron's mission. The training, called Operation Valhalla Strike, allowed the unit to complete requirements not possible ^t-00-08-31

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=553" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-09-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** at the Minot Air Force Base, including full-distance live-fire exercises. Camp Ripley provided full-distance firing ranges, which allowed defenders to hone their rifle marksmanship and machine gun proficiency, exceeding the capabilities of standard Air Force 25-meter training ranges. Okay, the squadron of more than 250 dedicated airmen and civilians supporting the 91st Missile Wing's global deterrence mission by defending the United States with the world's premier combat-ready intercontinental ballistic missile force. Okay, cool. ^t-00-09-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=595" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-09-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And yeah, it sure must be something of just a coincidence that Valhalla—which kind of struck everybody as odd—as was him going 33 hours, 33 hours, 33 hours. It was like there was a press conference that was happening for the American people, but he was signaling to other people who were like in the club to know what they needed to understand about what happened. Do you know what I mean? That's how I felt about Kash Patel's press conference and the things that he was saying. Something felt weird about it. 33 hours. 33 hours. And of course, yes, he did say something about Valhalla. Let's take a listen to what Kash Patel said. ^t-00-09-55

We have the watch. And I'll see you in Valhalla. ^t-00-10-32

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=647" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-10-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Probably just a coincidence, you guys, that this operation also fits just so neatly into our timeline. I love timelines. I love neat timelines. So let's pull that up again. I'm also gonna introduce a couple of corrections to yesterday. First and foremost, July 20th, we talked about SUBTT, which came in for its longest trip—that's correct—from Cairo. It went through to Paris, and then it went to Omaha, Nebraska. I think yesterday I said that it stayed in Wilmington for six days. No, it only stayed in Wilmington for one night. It stayed in Nebraska for the longest stretch yet, departing from Lincoln, Nebraska, in particular. ^t-00-10-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=690" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-11-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And this six-day stretch of what they were doing in Nebraska actually might offer us a clue because during this stretch, on July 22nd, the Nebraska Secretary of State, Bob Evnen, announced that they were going to put together a trade and investment delegation to Cairo, Egypt. What are the odds? You got this plane from Cairo, Egypt, and we're gonna pull this up and show you. And suddenly, you got this guy, Bob Evnen, and he says, "You know what? Let's plan a trip to Cairo and see if we can make some money with them." I'm gonna let you listen to—I think we have a news clip that will show you that that happened. ^t-00-11-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=733" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-12-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** (News clip) Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen is inviting business and industry leaders to take part in a trade mission, investment mission to Egypt later this year. Egypt's position in North Africa makes it an ideal gateway to doing business in the greater Middle East region, and our state excels in several sectors that Egypt is keen to invest in, including agricultural goods, manufacturing, water management, medical technology, and more. The mission is currently scheduled for October 26 through November 2. However, the dates are subject to change. Those interested in joining the delegation to Egypt can visit the Secretary of State's website or contact the office to learn more. ^t-00-12-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=777" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-12-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I wanna say to my Nebraskans, we should probably figure out—I didn't have time to do this—we should go through a schedule and see who we met with, because I feel like that idea might be related to our planes. I just don't think people in Nebraska are sitting around like, "Hey, we should go to Cairo or Egypt," and it happens to line up with this plane that comes in—literally comes in on the exact same day. And also minor correction: I think yesterday I said that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) spoke on July 18th; he actually spoke on July 11th. I just kind of copy-and-pasted that wrong, so we made that correction. Anyways, yeah, we can then see that we've added this addition. This Valhalla is now here on our timeline from August 24th to 29th. ^t-00-12-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=819" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-13-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** They have this joint operation, Valhalla, that's taking place at Camp Ripley, and we are really getting tight here. We are talking about T minus 12 days until Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is going to be assassinated. And here's what I hope you guys are seeing here—why I have said this was so clearly a military operation. Everything about this story is military, okay? We are receiving tips, and we had been receiving tips I had ignored previously that the French Foreign Legion was involved somehow in the assassination. Time will tell, okay? And I will present that more formally when I feel like we have concrete evidence. ^t-00-13-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=857" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-14-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But we have begun the process of sharing information with other content creators because there's something about this that feels that holding information is not going to help us. We have to—as soon as we get it—spread it with people that we trust: people that are actually fighting for Charlie (Charlie Kirk), people that are actually going max and telling the truth during this tremendous time of deceit. And what I can say for certain thus far is that the list of military connects in this story is just too long, okay? Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s surgeon, Dr. Lee Trotter—the alleged surgeon who apparently spoke about the miracle; we're supposed to assume spoke about the miracle, the 30-06. Again, he's not been confirmed, but we are pretty solid. ^t-00-14-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=900" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-15-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** This is our guy who happened to be a pilot who did his residency at an Air Force base. Oh, okay, that's interesting. We told you that Deidre Amaro—Dr. Deidre Amaro—is the medical examiner, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s medical examiner, who they've curiously not wanted to address publicly. Yeah, I told you she's also a major in the military. Oh, who would have thunk it? Andrew Colvett—obviously, his brother and his cousin are captains in the military. That's a fact. Frank Turk, who's there for the assassination, is a naval flight officer. His sons are in the Air Force. That's a fact. McCoys—naval intelligence, background in psychological operations because of granddad, and famed—actually, is granted the McCoys fame. ^t-00-15-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=942" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-15-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** There was like a fleet of ships named after the McCoys—very high up military. The video—the only two videos that we have that were recorded allegedly of the shooter: first and foremost, the video of him running away after the shot—way too fast. If he was actually crouched down shooting—common sense—it's too fast. You couldn't be in sprint that quickly for anybody that's actually fired a rifle. You know that you can't go from a crouching position to a full sprint in a split second. Well, that video was recorded by a person that is in the ROTC. I hunted that person down—very strange. They didn't want to be involved and sent it through three people to release onto the internet. And then it is boosted. And that's the video that everybody sees. ^t-00-15-42

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=987" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-16-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's supposed to make us think that there was actually someone on that rooftop. Then there's the video—the other, the second video—which is the guy laying down before the shots, right? That also was recorded by a person in the military who actually teaches shooting. So this is not a military campus, guys. Burton Hibbs—Butch—the brother of Pastor Jack Hibbs. Jack Hibbs phones up Charlie (Charlie Kirk); he's like, "Hey, can my brother come? Can my brother come and listen to you speak?" I guess this—whatever—it was a hotbed. Older people just love Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in Utah. Very hard to find a student that was just, you know, on campus that day who went to hear Charlie (Charlie Kirk) speak—probably because they barely advertised this event for a reason. ^t-00-16-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=1030" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-17-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Obviously, I think they wanted to control who was there. And there could have been a lot of people there that were controlled military men. That's my viewpoint. But Burton Hibbs—Butch—is the brother of Pastor Jack Hibbs. Obviously sons—I showed you—of an Air Force chief. Tyler Robinson is a Boy Scout whose Uncle Mitchell may be related. People have pulled this off of the internet, and I don't have a photo for you today. I should have grabbed it. ^t-00-17-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=1058" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-17-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Amber Robinson—there's just photos of them visiting—and Uncle Mitchell. Is this the Mitchell that allegedly convinced him to turn himself in, who's working? He's very much involved in the military. I believe with shooting in Ukraine, of all places. It's getting shady. And of course, our now infamous planes, SUBTT and SUBNT, are Egyptian military planes. And every plane that seems to be flying over UVU that day is somehow military-contracted planes. So are we supposed to think that this is all by coincidence? Or are we looking at an obvious military operation? And here's something else that I want to share with you. ^t-00-17-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=1101" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-18-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** As I've reviewed this footage, and any time that I think that somebody is shady or somebody is brought to my attention that is involved or I would like more information on, they happen to be wearing a maroon shirt. Have you guys noted this? Everybody that day—I know, look, everybody's liberal, and guys wear pink, and Abercrombie's a thing—but I have never in my life looked at—every guy seems to be wearing maroon. I'm like, "Who is this guy?" Oh, he's wearing a maroon shirt. Oh, he's wearing a maroon shirt. Tyler Robinson—everyone's wearing a maroon shirt—as if they were told to wear maroon shirts to identify each other. I'm communicating this to you because it keeps coming up in my research, and I think it means something. ^t-00-18-21

I don't think it's your go-to color for most men. In fact, it was so often that I was seeing this color that I reached out to my source at Utah, and I was like, "Maybe it's a school color. Maybe actually they're all buying shirts and buying T-shirts, and the school color for UVU is maroon." And he told me, "No, it's not maroon." So this feels like something that we shouldn't ignore. I did—I was able to track down a couple of episodes ago. I was telling you this Bush situation seems to be a little odd. People thought they saw somebody speaking to a bush. And I was able to determine who that person was that kind of comes out of the bush. ^t-00-19-03

But unusually, when I went to check that person's socials, they had posted on September 10th about their bulletproof skateboard—that I don't know if it was like a promo for his skateboard or whatever it was—but didn't do any follow-up posts about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Nobody in his family posted about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You had a front-row seat, and you watched Charlie (Charlie Kirk) die. And I guess no social posts about it—wasn't interested, maybe wanted to stay out of it. And then I obviously find out that his dad is the head of—and I hope I'm saying that correctly—president of the Mormon temple in Los Angeles. ^t-00-19-46

And then it just kind of becomes like a dark hole trying to figure out his father and his father's connections to the Middle East. So I am still working on that. But yes, he as well was wearing a maroon shirt. I think we need to pay attention to that as we widen our investigation because if I was the military, and the reason we didn't promote this event—and again, we're theorizing here—but the reason we wait to the very last second to put up posters about this event was because you didn't—because you actually did want to control who went there that day. You didn't want a bunch of people driving in from all over to see Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You wanted to control what videos were going to hit the internet. You controlled everybody who was video recording. ^t-00-20-28

If I wanted to control all of that, and I also wanted to use like civilians to show up, I would make sure they all knew to wear a certain shirt or to wear a certain hat so they knew who they were. That's me if I'm running a military operation—which I feel like I know because I do run kind of a toddler military operation. That's a good way to indicate who at Disney World is your family: everybody wearing the same color. So I think we should be clued into that, continue to follow our instincts, and to get as much information as we can because we are getting close. ^t-00-21-11

Yesterday, they were trying to make a trend that I got pranked by the person who wrote me the email. I told you I had run that off the chain for weeks to make sure everything was legit about that location. And it is 1000% legit, and it caused a lot of panic, and we're getting a lot of phone calls now from people telling us it has caused panic. The Egyptian planes definitively were pulled into Satis, and that person was then escorted for whatever reason.

So we're gonna take a brief break and throw it to some of our sponsors. All right, you guys. Many people have been vilified for standing up for truth. I think many people have felt the sting of injustice, but we're also feeling tremendously courageous in these times. I'm done playing defense. I've not watered down what I believe to be palatable anymore because silence is not kindness. It's actually consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds the topic of lives that are lost before they even take their first breath.

Okay, so one of the things that is just getting weirder by the day is the general public having to pretend like the United States is not completely infiltrated by Zionist psychopaths. And it's just getting odd, right? They're going through extraordinary lengths to let us know that they have all the power, and they're gonna do whatever it is that they want. And they're just engaging in naked propaganda to serve the state of Israel. So let me show you a couple of these headlines. I guess let's start with Mike Huckabee. He is the ambassador to Israel and apparently is completely shameless. ^t-00-24-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=1528" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:25:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-25-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now just to go back—in case you missed it back in October—Mike Huckabee and the former U.S. ambassador to Israel—which was David Friedman—took to the stage in Jerusalem to perform "Sweet Home Alabama." And by "Sweet Home Alabama," I mean "Sweet Home Jerusalem" in Hebrew or something. Just watch it, and hey—challenge: no cringing. ^t-00-25-28

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=1571" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:26:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-26-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I'm starting to think that Israel wants us to hate them. Like that's the ultimate psy-op: they want us to hate them. It's unbelievable—the factor of cringe. And if that's not humiliating enough, Mike Huckabee just went over to Israel and met with Jonathan Pollard. Jonathan Pollard—if that name is not familiar to you—is a literal convicted Israeli spy. This is the headline. Yeah, there he is. Seems like a good guy. American who spied for Israel says he met Ambassador Mike Huckabee to thank him for his support because he did support him. ^t-00-26-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXdKV-OBog&t=1607" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:26:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-mKXdKV-OBog/t-00-26-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Jonathan spent 30 years in prison on espionage charges after being found to have pretended to work for the American government but was actually working to pass documents over to Israel. That's kind of a theme. Our greatest ally. It's just a theme with our greatest ally. And despite being found guilty—despite spending 30 years in prison—people were saying we should be kinder to this guy, and Huckabee was among several pro-Israel politicians who advocated for Jonathan Pollard to be released. And when he was released, was welcomed in Israel—the red carpet was rolled out for him, I think, literally. And I think Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) met him on the runway like, "You served us well." You've served us well. ^t-00-26-47

So you'd think Mike Huckabee would go, "I'm not going to meet with him because that shows that I am an Israel-first star." But there is just a level of shamelessness that I don't know. What was it that Karoline Leavitt said? They asked Karoline Leavitt about this at the White House, and she said—and I quote—"The White House was not aware of that meeting, but the president stands by our ambassador." Well said, Karoline. I mean, "I didn't know he was going to meet with a traitor, but we stand by him anyway if he's meeting a traitor." And the reason we stand by him is because we're all traitors. We are all treasonous. I hate everyone. I hate that this is allowed. ^t-00-27-32

Their job, I guess, is to further enslave us to the gang colony in the Middle East that is pretending that they have been ordained by God to murder. And yeah, I don't know. There is some comedic relief coming though. Tim Dillon covering anything is always hilarious, and he is covering the occupation of our media because it's just so in our faces now. It's never been this in our face, you know? ^t-00-28-14

She notoriously left The New York Times and said it was biased, and we needed to have something that was in the middle of the line, and she just couldn't get behind all of this COVID propaganda, and she was gonna start The Free Press, and they were gonna go back to doing hardcore, real, non-biased journalism. So what kind of journalism are they doing over at The Free Press, okay? This is a real email. I'm not being funny. I feel like you're gonna think this is SNL that fluttered into my inbox the other day from a writer. ^t-00-28-48

This must be straight middle-of-the-line, right? There can't be any bias here. I'm reporting a piece for The Free Press on the economics of high-engagement political content on YouTube and podcast platforms. I'm reaching out for comment regarding several assertions that you've made in recent episodes, including claims about Israel, the death of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and the Becoming Brigitte series. I also want to ask about the financial side of your operation because it is central to the story." Here are his five questions. ^t-00-29-33

Two: have sponsors and ad partners or platform reps encouraged or pushed back on this shift in content direction? Three: do you see any correlation between escalation in claims and the performance metrics that drive your business? Retention, average viewer duration, CPM, RPM, member conversion, etc. Four: to what extent do you view conspiracy content as an editorial choice versus a business decision? And five: do you believe your recent content about Israel and Jewish influence is rooted in evidence, or do you see it primarily as commentary? ^t-00-30-09

And I'm going to get back to my—I'm just going to—I have to just pull up the pivot over to that SS tab, you know, the Hitler tab—which shows the metrics of exactly how people are responding to anti-Jewish. What do you say? Anti-Jewish rhetoric. And we have to pull that from YouTube because that's—I can see we've done some tests. And obviously the advertisers have been—that's the whole thing. That's the nature of the business: obviously, is that you can only make money. The only people that are being successful—that are successful at all—it's pretty obvious—is because they hate Jews. That's kind of what's implied. Why do we have to pretend this is journalism, right? Are you shocked if I tell you that Ashley Reinsberg—he happens to live in Tel Aviv? ^t-00-30-55

Like, just write your articles. Stop pretending that you're a journalist. It's totally fine. Your job is to write hit pieces to say that you guys should be victimized at all times forever since the beginning of time. And it's not—it's obviously not anything that you're doing that's causing reactions. I mean, what? It's not like they're just genociding Palestinians right now. So it's about metrics. It's about the SS tab that's behind the scenes of YouTube. So I'll get that content— I'll get those metrics over to you, Ash. Looking forward to that. Further to that commentary, Tim Dillon—who always gets me in trouble. I don't know how he never gets sued. It feels wrong. ^t-00-31-40

And she goes on a rant against me—not against Tim Dillon, okay? I'm speaking about Brigitte and MK Ultra. Brigitte sues me—not Tim Dillon—who she mentions in the lawsuit. So I'm just asking if anybody wants to sue Tim Dillon. That's all I'm saying, okay? Go after him. I'm enjoying his content. It's his fault. Here's what he had to say about Bari Weiss' installation—because that's what it was. She just installed. It's not a meritocracy. At the head of CBS News. Take a listen. ^t-00-32-20

But you know, somebody that is this sinister in terms of harassing people, suing people, going after people who even discuss the truth of their history— like, that's a committed psychopath, you know? There's no shame there. And yeah, Brigitte's a gangster. Like, he's a gangster. There's no question about it. And the people that are sending us tips—like, we should look further into Satis. It is correct, by the way. We did look into that. Somebody had said that they did, in late July, have a CEO switch for one of their subsidiaries in Hamburg, Germany—which is of course interesting because that is where Jean-Michel Jarre disappears for a couple of decades and joins the military. ^t-00-38-09

And the CEO is an Israeli, and it's in Hamburg. There's a lot going on there with Satis. And like I said, we're information-sharing in the background, and we are definitely getting closer. I think Icarus is flying a little too close to the sun. If what we're hearing turns out to be true, it is going to be—well, transformative in all of the right ways—for our society and understanding just how evil and sinister this thing can be. Second biggest comment from yesterday's episode: "It was supposed to be you" is an insane thing to say to someone after an assassination. It was wild. It was gnarly. ^t-00-38-54

Look, there was a reason I had to take a break. I was just... I can't even explain to you how I felt. I was just physically sick from having watched Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. I was physically sick from then being told that I was on the short list—that they were going to move to try to murder me ^t-00-39-36

Unfortunately, I didn't even know—Charlie (Charlie Kirk), it was just—I don't know. I am tremendously—if I could pat myself on the back for anything—it's that I came out the other side of that because it was meant to traumatize me, and it was traumatizing. But it was meant to render me, I guess, inefficient. And it actually now is tethering me to— I think a lot of us, right? Like they were supposed to, I guess, make us silent. And now we're realizing, "Whoa, we have to stop and drop the petty politics and recognize that there is something way more evil going on." ^t-00-39-58

We have a comment from Jamie Pellucci today. Jamie writes: "We should look into how the French language translates into English when a French person is trying to fabricate a combo between two young male lovers. It might come out sounding like the ridiculous text combo. Maybe some words in French translate to 'my love' actually." Yeah, French is a very romantic language. Yeah, that is such an interesting and creative perspective there. This is why I love the decentralized intelligence agency. Holly Carlin writes: "We needed a hoodie that says 'Go Max.'"

Okay, to the hoodies: "I'll Go Max." When we solve this thing, we will do that. I wanna make sure we hit the max. Maybe we'll even have "Gone Max" or "Went Max." And happy birthday to Amanda. I am happy if I have helped in any way to give people the confidence to fight. And we are in a time of tremendous deception, but we are also in a time of tremendous revelation.

So whatever that is that is sitting behind them— yeah, that's power. Okay. It's got to be generational power. That's not—that's not "Hey, I'm new here and trying this thing out."

I know people were saying that—like Valhalla used to be a program out in New Zealand. Guys, if you can look it up and figure out that it's a program in New Zealand, it's not a good program, right? So that's like the most hopeful wish that I think all of us wanted to. I definitely looked at Facebook; I was like, "I just hope he's alive, and none of this is real." And I had to then contend with the fact that it's very real. And that was obviously in large part due to my contacts that saw Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s body and can't deny that.

What was done in secret will be revealed—especially thanks to your courage and the courage of all of you guys around the world." People have taken real risks—like that person did to tell me that a foreign dignitary was being brought to 920 North King. By the way, to their like false debunking, where they said, "Kettis' lawyer is in this office." So to clarify matters for you guys: first and foremost, there were parts that I did not read for a very specific reason. Secondly, my lawyer—as you guys know, watching the show—has always been Noah. And the way that lawsuits work is state by state; they have different laws. And so when we oddly got sued in Delaware, ^t-00-43-34

That's just how it works. So in every circumstance, in every lawsuit that I've been involved in, you will see that it's never Noah that's actually filing or listed on any of the paperwork for that reason. And it can vary state by state, but it's—I've always seen that to be the case. I was not aware of that before this letter—is what I will say. And I will—that is what I will say. I will say that right now because I think that is enough to say. ^t-00-44-19

If you're waking up to how things really work, show them love when you see them." Yes, and you definitely should do that because I think we're all seeing that the conspiracies are real left and right—by the way—that people were telling the truth at various times and that there is great tremendous evil; that much of this is a matrix; the system is rigged; it is not fair. And it can only stay rigged if we keep arguing with one another.

Joe seemed to be self-censoring himself and changing the subject whenever Israel or billionaire sex offenders were mentioned." I have not watched in its entirety. I know that Joe Rogan has definitely had people on—spoken about Israel. He's really gone there. He had Ian Carroll. So that would be unusual. Yeah, Joe Rogan has definitely taken a lot of risks.
