Yes, in case you missed it, we officially have become the number one podcast in the world—not in America, okay, not Europe. I am talking about in the world, and the haters stay mad. Haters stay big mad on the internet. On X today, it is just crazy town. I mean, Christian Zionist influencers are doing that thing where they attack me for telling the truth about something. It's so strange. I don't even know how to react to it. I'm gonna do my best here. They're all weighing in, and they're commenting, and they're saying untruths about something that is literally true. It's literally true. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=45" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-00-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I lived it. It's such a strange thing. It's like they're trying to wipe my own memory and wipe my own emails that I have. Of course, we are at first—before we get to them—going to cover the top moments, top viral moments from the heavily anticipated interview with Erika Kirk (Charlie Kirk's widow) on Fox News with Jesse Watters. So let's get started. Okay, first things first. Welcome to the number one podcast in the world. It's here. You are here. We are all number one in the world. It's been trending on Twitter. ^t-00-00-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=90" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-01-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's been so exciting. Look at this. I will never forget this moment. "Candace Owens' podcast hits number one worldwide, best part, without promotion," which means we have not spent—since we started this podcast a year and a half ago—a single dollar on advertising. Okay. Because we couldn't do it. We were a startup. I was fired. Things were down. It was real bad. And yet we are the number one podcast in the world. Grok summarizes it this way. I'm going to read it. Conservative commentator Candace Owens announced on Thursday that her independent podcast, Candace, has reached the top global ranking according to Podscribe data following her 2024 departure from the Daily Wire. ^t-00-01-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=130" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-02-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** She credits the organic growth to criticism, legal challenges including a defamation lawsuit from French President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron, and her small team's resilience. Owens attributes the milestone to divine intervention amid ongoing media attacks. Fact checked. It's just true. All of it is very true. I am so excited. I would like to thank everyone but the Academy because the matrix hates me. I will never win any more accolades, probably never be invited to a red carpet event, but that's okay because I've never been happier. And there are so many people to thank. It is true. We must thank Brigitte ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=171" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-02-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** and Emmanuel Macron for that ill-advised lawsuit. Obviously, I feel like that ripped a hole in reality and made things even more global than they already were. I'd like to thank Kanye West—formerly Kanye West; he is now Ye—for the song "Power," because the song "Power" really made me recognize that you have to stop listening to your haters. You also should recognize that you need the haters to inspire you to keep going. When somebody tells you you can't be something or you must be something, you have to stand up for yourself. You have to have the courage to say, "I know the crowd is doing this, but I'm not doing it." And that was me when I no longer wanted to do the pro-Israel thing. Of course, as always, I thank Ben Shapiro. I thank Jeremy Boreing. ^t-00-02-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=215" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-03-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I thank the Daily Wire and them realizing it before I did that I should be fired. Thank you for firing me. And thank you for the publicity of the firing. Andrew Klavan: Christ is King. Thank you so much. You are here in my book. Tucker (Tucker Carlson), I don't know. I feel like I should thank you because a lot happened because people thought that we were plotting behind the scenes, and we never were. And thank you, Tucker Carlson, for the weeks that I get off when the media is attacking you instead of me. Now it's kind of together. It's "Tucker Carlson in Kamala zones," but thank you. I want to thank Australia. We see you, Australia. Tony Burke, thank you for banning us from an entire country. ^t-00-03-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=256" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-04-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Even though I didn't do nothing—I literally didn't do nothing—but I'm banned. And guess what? You got to hear me anyways. Ha ha ha, Tony Burke. Okay, but in reality, also obviously thanking this incredible team—very small. It has stayed small. There's just four of us that work on the actual podcast every day. Savannah wearing a ton of hats, Chris in editing, Mark mansplaining and also being our director, Skylar the producer who has to deal with my insane text messages all through the night because my brain is running a million different ways. It's just a really tiny little engine that keeps going. And so that's why we are actually resilient. We do need to hire more people. And you guys still are not getting a window in there. I just want to be clear. I don't want them to get too excited. There will never be any breathing room in the control room. ^t-00-04-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=300" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-05-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And yeah, obviously it's been a tremendous year, and mostly thankful to my husband for figuring out how to operate an entire podcast business. I don't know how he does it. I don't know how he deals with things. He doesn't have time to even watch the show, and he's just constantly putting out fires. Could not have done this with out all of you guys for letting me know that it's okay to just be honest. And it was definitely a trying year realizing that—especially now the conservatism thing—what is conservatism? The Republican Party is going through a moment. I don't want to be tied down to the Republican Party. And I want to be able to say something against Democrats and Republicans. And we're doing that. We're speaking truth. We're going to continue to speak truth. And we're very excited today. ^t-00-05-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=343" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-05-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And one of the things that we are speaking truth about right now—and which my haters are like—is it's because you're talking about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You know, you guys change this every month. First it was, "Oh, it's because of the Brigitte Macron thing." "Oh, it's because of the Kamala Chronicles." "Oh, it's because of the Blake Lively lawsuit." The common denominator here is me looking for truth. And I think people are catching on to the fact that I'm sincerely looking for truth, and I don't care what enemies I make along the way. And obviously I'm making a lot of enemies right now for some reason looking into the Charlie Kirk assassination and the lies that we are being told. Anyways, let's get into Erika Kirk. Obviously it was a very anticipated interview. I think we didn't really know what we were going to get. ^t-00-05-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=386" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-06-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I don't know why I thought it was going to be like more about the investigation. And obviously, in retrospect, that's not what it was about because it's Fox News, and Fox News is not going to do this like heavy investigation. It was kind of more giving her a platform to speak about how things have changed for her, how things have changed for Turning Point USA, what it's like being at the helm of the organization, what her thoughts are about what that organization is going to look like going forward. And he—I'm speaking about Jesse Watters, who hosted this discussion—also trailed her at the event that she did with JD Vance at the University of Mississippi. Now, people around the world obviously have been moved by Erika's commitment to her Christian faith, ^t-00-06-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=431" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-07-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** the strength—obviously—that it takes for her to look after her kids, to look after herself, plus to steward this massive company all while she's grieving, right? And that's kind of one of the things that stood out the most to a lot of people. But I would say the Christian message is what has resonated the most when she got up on stage and she said that she forgives him pretty instantly. I mean, when was the memorial event? Was it only—what—10, 11 days after he was assassinated? I think it was even less, maybe. Was it like the 19th—9 days after he was assassinated? Oh, sorry, the 21st—mansplained in my ear. Thank you, Mark. ^t-00-07-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=469" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-07-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So Jesse asked her about the harder moments that she has encountered becoming a widow. And she shared that nighttime is the hardest. She also shared her experience with the emotions of being a widow compared to the emotions that other widows may experience when grappling with sudden loss. And here's what she had to say. Take a listen. ^t-00-07-49

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=494" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-08-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** (Erika Kirk clip): It's so easy to be in a position of feeling regret when you lose someone you love. And I tried to read a book by C.S. Lewis because he lost the love of his life. He was only married to her for four years. It's called A Grief Observed. It was a very hard book to read, not because it was about grief, but because in the opening pages he talked about how angry he was with God. And I've never felt that. I'm not angry with God. Never have I. ^t-00-08-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=538" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-08-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Never have I questioned, "Why, Lord, are you putting me through this?" "Why are you testing me?" "Why are you...?" Because God is so good and He's so sovereign. And I know He uses everything—everything—even what the enemy meant for evil. And I have no regrets. ^t-00-08-58

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=563" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-09-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So when I saw this moment, I was just thinking about myself and a lot of emotions and grieving that I have experienced, and all the emotions that I've shared with you guys and the anger that I have felt. And I wanna be very clear that I am not that example that she is giving. I could have never—and I know that so many people agree with this—I could have never forgiven Tyler Robinson for whatever part he played in this. And obviously I'm saying whatever part he played in this because I don't believe that he was the lone person involved. I don't even think it's a person that killed Charlie Kirk. But even if you believe all those things, I never could have turned around and forgiven him that quickly, right? And I have not even processed. I definitely, when I prayed about this, asked a ton of questions to God. ^t-00-09-23

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=608" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:08</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-10-08.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And yeah, she is absolutely right in what she is saying. And she is delivering to us what the biblical teaching is on these matters, but I could not not feel that way. And so I was questioning myself, listening. It's like, what is wrong with me? Like, well, actually, what is wrong with me? Why am I not able to get to forgiveness? Why am I not able to—or why am I rather questioning and asking why and why doing this to somebody so young? I mean, even my dad— by the way—was so impacted. He met Charlie (Charlie Kirk) a couple of times, but he was so impacted by Charlie Kirk's assassination that it made him go, "I want to be—and my dad said this—I want to be a better grandfather and a better father, because I look at myself and I'm older, and I haven't lived a life anywhere near as admirable as Charlie has lived his life." ^t-00-10-08

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=644" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-10-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** My dad literally said this to me on the phone. And it makes me feel like, why him? Why did this happen to Charlie Kirk? And I just—yeah—I don't know. That's kind of what I was thinking. I was going, "Wow, what is wrong with me that I have felt all of those things that she has had the wisdom to just not go through that, you know what I mean?" Or not—I guess I shouldn't say not go through that—but not fixate on that. I couldn't today, after everything that's happened, be like, "I forgive Tyler Robinson." ^t-00-10-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=687" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-11-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I can't do it. I just can't do it. And I think maybe if I'm assessing myself and being hypercritical of myself right now, it's because I cannot forgive until I know what happened. I don't know what I'm forgiving actually until I know what happened. And this might move into what we're gonna get into later, where she answers the question. We're gonna get to it right now actually: of whether or not she believes that they have caught the true killer of Charlie Kirk, right? Do you believe that? The person that we have in custody—is that the person that pulled the trigger? Is that the only person that pulled the trigger? Anyways, I want you to hear it directly from her and not me recapping what she said or reiterating it rather. It's gone viral because of what she didn't say, to be honest with you. ^t-00-11-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=733" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-12-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Take a listen. ^t-00-12-13

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=737" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-12-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** (Jesse Watters interviewing Erika Kirk clip): Do you think they've caught your husband's killer? ^t-00-12-17

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=738" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-12-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** So, something I'm so grateful for is that we have one of the most incredible teams for this case. I would never wish it upon anybody to have to go through what we are going through: to have seen the autopsy report, to have seen the different evidence portions that have been collected. I trust our team. ^t-00-12-18

---
**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=764" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-12-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So it's not a straight yes or no, and the implication could be that she trusts the team to find more or to get answers—or if this is not it—to tell her what the true answers are. And I think that's why this is going viral because they're going, "Okay, does she actually believe that Tyler Robinson acted alone?" And obviously Jesse is not gonna push her on that because it would have probably felt more like an interrogation rather than just sitting down and speaking through some of these topics that are probably hard to talk about in general. But I am hopeful that... ^t-00-12-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=810" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-13-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** What she's implying is that she trusts her team to do the due diligence. She says that she has seen the autopsy report. She has seen certain things. Obviously none of us have seen the autopsy report. And I didn't know what to make of that. Is she saying that there's more that's gonna come out? Is that kind of a foreshadowing that more is going to come out and things are going to be clear? I hope so. I really do. Because in terms of what the public has seen so far, I would say nothing has been convincing. And I'm trying to imagine what they would have that the public hasn't seen that could be sort of a smoking gun. And in theory it would be the footage, right? ^t-00-13-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=853" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-14-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Tyler Boyer said, "We have footage in 4K—all of the stuff," when he was tweeting. And similarly, not the university, but somebody else was saying that, you know, at every angle, every area of the university is covered. Their excuse for not showing the public was they didn't want it to in any way impact the case. That has never made sense to me. That excuse has never made sense to me. In fact, I would imagine that when there was a manhunt going on—before you even thinking about the case, but rather thinking about keeping people safe—that would have been a good time to drop some clear footage of the individual. But it's possible. It's possible they have actual clear footage of Tyler Robinson jumping down onto the rooftop and firing the shot. ^t-00-14-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=889" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-14-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's all possible. And so we're just going to have to wait and see on that. Now, I'm going to say personally—and maybe even selfishly, probably selfishly again—I'm fallen. I am very fallen, obviously. I was extremely excited that she responded to the Catholic innuendo once and for all in her own way. Obviously it was not a direct question or anything. But two things happened here. One you probably didn't catch, which is behind Jesse and Erika as they're walking backstage at the University of Mississippi event that they headlined: ^t-00-14-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=925" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-15-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** there was a priest. Look in the corner there. I know a priest's collar when I see one. Yep, that is the same priest that she took with her to the hospital when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot. And I don't know. I am maintaining that I think this may have been about more than the architecture. And in case you are not there yet: in addition to that, the priest being caught behind the scenes there, they traveled with Erika, and she discusses Charlie's affinity for Saint Michael. Take a listen. ^t-00-15-25

I asked him. I was like, "Why don't you wear a cross?" He's like, "Why?" "You say you're a Christian, but you don't wear a cross." He's like, "I don't know. I don't really—I'm not a jewelry guy." And I was like, "I understand." So for his first birthday present, I got him this cross. And then throughout time, I would always add different medals to it. And so he always—he loved Saint Michael. And so, yeah, every time he put this on, he just felt like it was his—it was his armor. Are we done here, guys? ^t-00-16-08

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

Okay, now I wanted to point that out because in retrospect I get more and more just amazed and upset at how vicious and cruel and unnecessary people are. Just all of the videos people made when I wasn't even mentioning it as a big deal. I was doing a tribute video to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and being like, "We were all hoping that he was going to take the step and become Catholic." Gave no details. And the next thing I knew, Operation Christian Zionist Influencer was—while I was in a state of trauma and grieving—coming after me and saying that it wasn't true. And I don't think any of them have made videos since clarifying that, no, Candace seems to have been telling the truth—because who cares about the truth when you can just dunk on Candace? But I thought that was a very natural way to kind of respond to it. ^t-00-16-42

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwG1juDCQZQ&t=1046" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-vwG1juDCQZQ/t-00-17-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And, you know, she's probably not going to give us any more because she doesn't have to give us any more. Like I said from the beginning: he didn't convert to Catholicism, but it's just kind of okay for us to tell the truth about where he was at on his spiritual journey. I don't know why that's a big deal at all outside of just hating Catholics—which is what I am receiving a lot of—and there's just been so many lies that have been told, and we're going to get into more of them later and the frustration that I have with people who purport to care about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Why they peddle ridiculous, tiny lies—doesn't make sense to me. Anyways, but keeping with Erika's interview: she was asked directly—and this is probably the most viral moment from the sit-down—about how she personally feels about the conspiracy theories that are circulating regarding his murder. And here is her answer. ^t-00-17-26

I just didn't turn it on for weeks on end. I've intentionally insulated myself because I need to guard my heart, and I need to be there for my kids, and I need to be there for Turning Point. And what I've realized through all of this is that everyone grieves differently. Everyone is trying to figure out, and I don't blame them, how does this happen? How does somebody become so radicalized where they can justify this in their own head? We just lost one of the greatest voices of our generation. Why? How? What's behind it? Like, everyone's trying to process this. ^t-00-18-22

But where my heart is just asking for some grace is for the ones who were there that day. They have to relive that every single day. He didn't die in a car accident. He didn't die from cancer. He was assassinated. And the difference between this and previous assassinations in this country is there was no social media. There was no AI. I can't tell you how many fake images are out there of all of this. And again, ^t-00-19-07

I don't want my kids to go on the internet one day when they're older and see things that—it's just—we're all trying to process this in our own way, and I appreciate that. But just some grace would be nice. ^t-00-19-50

And also this was a traumatic event that the entire world experienced. And also the reason why the internet is investigating is because the feds aren't—and not only are they not investigating, they're telling some pretty obvious lies, right? Number one being that he was shot by a .30-06 and stopped the bullet when, in a normal circumstance, it would have decapitated him. Like, .30-06 would decapitate someone. And because they've been so ridiculous and then gaslighting us by being like, "You're dishonoring Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) legacy," people are digging their feet in the ground because it just disrupts us spiritually to watch something like that and then be told, like, "Nothing to see here." ^t-00-20-17

The people that were there that day experienced a trauma because they watched Charlie Kirk die—or maybe they didn't see him die; maybe watched him get shot, heard the shot—who knows what the exact specs are. This is where it's going to be really hard for Erika to be a CEO and to be somebody who is a widow at the same time, right? Because the messaging that is coming out of Turning Point USA—so this is Erika in her CEO and her chairman capacity—has just been unacceptable, right? It can't be both. It can't be ^t-00-20-52

And, you know, Mikey's going to take over for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at his Liberty Convocation Liberty event that he has—which is going to be sold out. And Turning Point USA—people who are directors of faith—they're going to be telling you, like, 'Mikey's got what it takes.' Here's which blah, blah, blah. And then Mikey's going to tell stories about that day, go on a show multiple times. Andrew's going to talk about it. Everyone's going to talk about it. And they don't want to talk about the stuff that we care about. Like this is what it means to have a podcast. Right. You can't want fame ^t-00-21-29

This is kind of the Meghan Markle thing, right? That we talk about. And I'm calling this out to Mikey McCoy. It's like: everybody wants to be famous until you're famous, okay? We want privacy now. Well, it doesn't actually work that way. You don't get to be like, "I wanna marry you and I wanna be a princess," and then become a princess. You're like, "Well, I don't wanna be a princess," right? It's kind of—you gotta pick one or the other. So if there were Turning Point individuals who were so traumatized that day and they needed to go away—I mean, I had to go away for two weeks to collect my thoughts about the trauma that I saw having watched it. A lot of people I know had to take breaks. I had to take the show off the air for a couple of days, and they just—you know—needed time to process. ^t-00-22-14

Actually, it almost came across like they needed zero time to process, and they were kind of annoyed that the world needed time to process. And then the things that they were telling us were lies. We were able to factually debunk things that we were being told. And then you've got people like Tyler—who's featured in this—Tyler Boyer, who I like. You're the chairman and the CEO. Tyler Boyer is a sexual deviant, right? Why do we have to like give—because he was at the hospital—give him grace? But it's like: no, this is the company. This is now what's at the head of the company. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) not there. We want to make sure that this company is going to be committed to truth. ^t-00-22-54

That's what it means, right? Is this still the same company? And so I think with the McCoy thing, everyone wanted a stage until you got a stage. Okay. And people started going, "Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie." Right. Case in point: Alex Clark wanted to do the Wall Street Journal thing until I caught like this little lie. And it's like: what are you saying this thing about Catholics? That's not true. Okay: take the stage or don't take the stage, but it can't be in between. And then suddenly when the public turns against you: "I don't want a stage anymore." That would be—that would be my response to that. And I don't—I do not have any sympathy for Rob McCoy. ^t-00-23-38

I have no sympathy for Tyler Boyer. I—yeah—I think telling the truth is a very easy thing to do when you have a microphone. And if you don't want to tell the truth, it just makes you look more suspicious. And I can give you an example of that. There was some kid who was wearing green at this UVU event, right? They looked kind of shady. There was a ton of rumors. We got a bunch of emails, but I never covered it on the show because I didn't think there was anything beyond the fact that he looked kind of shady in a green hoodie. And I think it was yesterday Sam Parker was like, "Who are these guys?" And: "I can't get a clear image of this person." I then respond to him like, "Here's a clear image of this person." ^t-00-24-22

He's like, "That's me. Sorry, I dress weird." I think he's on the soccer team at UVU. And that's it. It's over. And nobody is talking about the green hoodie. Here is Colby Sessions. "Hey guys, this is me. My teammate and I were just on campus to get food and stopped by the event. We always wear silly stuff like that. Sorry, guys." That's it. How easy, right? How easy? He's not like, "I'm a victim—call a lawyer. I can't believe somebody asked a question." "I can't believe there's interest in this event where an assassination took place." No: people are asking because they're well-meaning, and he just comes right back and answers it, and it's over. That's how easy, that's how quick, that's how painless it is when you simply tell the truth. ^t-00-25-07

So, except for the parts that we want to know about. I don't know—doesn't work for me. Anyways, if you guys want to watch that interview in its entirety, you definitely should. It is available on Fox News, Fox News Primetime, Jesse Watters—and that's what we're going to say about that. Take a brief break, and we're going to get into some Christian Zionist influencers. I've been speaking to you guys a lot about Riverbend Ranch because I love their steaks—black Angus beef that is famous for its great flavor. But Riverbend Ranch has taken black Angus beef to a whole new level because over the last 35 years Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. ^t-00-25-52

Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones and without antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. So when you purchase from Riverbend Ranch, you're not only supporting the 64 cowboys and their families who work on that ranch, ^t-00-26-34

It is born in the USA, raised in the USA, processed right here in the USA. The meat is aged to perfection for 21 days, and then it is shipped directly from their ranch to your home. This is not your average black Angus beef. This is more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef that I've ever tasted.

All right, let's start with a little back-and-forth that I had with Allie Beth Stuckey online. I'll start actually by saying some nice things about Allie Beth Stuckey because one of the things that I am working on is being a lot more measured when I'm ticked off about something. And I realized that this particular subject is just—I just instantly want to go claws out. ^t-00-28-47

I've actually worked with Allie Stuckey at various events. I've spoken with Allie Stuckey. She's been on my podcast multiple times. She's been a panelist back when I was on the Daily Wire—I'm referring to. She debated my husband. Before I was Catholic, they had a very good sit-down, and she's always been very kind. Behind the scenes, I will always tell you guys if there's tea—there actually isn't any on Allie Stuckey. She's always been a very lovely person. And especially because when I was first coming into the industry and people were dunking on me for all sorts of things, she actually—like—hosted me on her show and had a conversation rather than just kind of joining the choir. ^t-00-29-20

I'm addressing this because she has been addressing me—actually subtly, subtweeting these sorts of things. And I feel like it's fair that when people engage in that sort of behavior that I get to respond. Somehow people are allowed to talk about me, and then when I respond, some people will suddenly be like, "I stand with so-and-so." I'm like, "What are you talking about? I'm just answering someone." For me, this topic—Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), who murdered him—there isn't a single topic in politics that is happening on this planet that I care more about, okay? ^t-00-30-05

And in the aftermath of his assassination, people were downright nasty to me. You saw that. It was definitively not organic. It was this weird need to assert his legacy as a Christian Zionist. By the way, I'm not including Allie in the downright nasty category whatsoever, but she was one of the voices who cast unnecessary shade, I would say, on my account of him becoming Catholic-curious. And it was unnecessary, I would say, only because she could have texted me. She has my number. This is one of the things that Matt Walsh recently said: that he views it as such a form of disloyalty when you have access to an individual, but you will instead go onto your platform to say something about that individual when you could ask for clarity, right? ^t-00-30-42

And I would have said to her, "Hey, privately, yeah: he was going to Mass sometimes daily. He was going on Sundays. He died with a pendant," but that didn't happen. Anyways, she's asserted that she's a friend of Charlie Kirk. She certainly has worked with Charlie Kirk for years. All that is true. We are natural allies because we are committed to wanting there to be justice and genuinely are both upset by Charlie (Charlie Kirk) being no longer here—not seeing where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was supposed to go in his life, ^t-00-31-23

But it feels to me that there are some people who only want to use their platforms to dispel something that I am saying that they think is untrue—even when I present proof that it is true. And an example of that is this morning. So yesterday I said to you guys—as a person who worked at Turning Point USA, who toured with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) the most, okay? There's a single person who can say, "I headlined more Turning Point USA campus tours than Candace Owens." ^t-00-31-56

It's a very strange thing to not know what the inner workings are and to then accuse somebody who shows an email—as I did yesterday—that these events are booked the semester before, okay? There's a long waiting list. Everybody wants Charlie (Charlie Kirk) or Candace—whoever it is, Don Jr.—to come to their campus. And they make those requests early. The Turning Point chapters—they have so many of them. And so they are constantly running behind on those requests. And it's a very long process because the administrations at these campuses naturally hate Turning Point USA in particular because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ^t-00-32-39

So they give these kids a very hard time over everything. When I tell you a hard time: when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I were speaking at Stanford, the student who put the event together—her grandfather owned one of the buildings at Stanford. Like, her name was on one of the buildings at Stanford University. And they still gave her a hard time pulling the event together, right? It doesn't matter. It's more the sentiment of who you are as a political person and as a political organization. And they will try to stop you. And that is why it is strange—as in it has never happened while I toured for eight, nine semesters: eight—2019 summer— ^t-00-33-20

It's never happened that a college makes a request over the summer when school is closed—because it was, okay, at the end of July; school was not in session. And then it gets honored by Turning Point USA immediately. And then it's on the calendar. Could you imagine the university getting that email? They already hate Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), and they're gonna honor it and be like: "Not only do we wanna honor this; we'll give you the first week back to school." Like, that's what they're telling us, and it doesn't make any sense. And I pointed that out, and I showed proof of that. What are you disagreeing with actually? ^t-00-34-00

I will read her tweets, and then I will respond to them. So she does a total false debunking by sharing a private message exchange between her and Charlie (Charlie Kirk). This is what she tweeted. She said: "The latest claim is that TPUSA must have been in on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) murder because the UVU campus stop was approved in July." It was not approved in July; it was requested in July. And that's too short of a timeline for an event in September. That is not true. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) texted me at the end of August for a campus event in early November. That's about two months out. And the reason he didn't specify which campus is because he didn't even know yet. ^t-00-34-44

So yes: it does seem like part of this year's campus tour was being put together at the last minute, and UVU being booked over the summer isn't actually unusual. "Hey, would love to have you join us on campus on November 3rd." What does this prove? It proves that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) invited her to join him on campus on November 3rd. If he is giving you multiple locations—and I'm telling you this as someone who did that; I worked for this organization, Allie, okay? It's probably because these are the— this is already approved. They're doing these campuses already. He's asking you which one to choose. Many times these students will be told to hold two dates— ^t-00-35-26

They did not start planning that event when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) texted you. I can guarantee you that, okay? They did not receive a request from those campuses on that day. It's an absurdity. I don't even know what we're debating. She then follows it up, and she says this: "Since some of you guys are struggling"—because people pointed out that's not what Candace said. It's a request that went from UVU chapter to Turning Point USA. She says: "Some of you guys are struggling. No venue yet, two months out." There's clearly a venue because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is saying in this chat: "November 3rd at—Mikey McCoy, actually—November 3rd at 6:30 p.m., either Auburn—which has 5,000 seats—or the University of Southern Alabama." ^t-00-36-11

Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would headline one; I would headline the other. I will guarantee you—and I checked—they did both of these this semester because that's how it works, okay? He's asking you which one you wanna join. They might both be holding the auditoriums that they need to. But this was not being planned when they messaged you. They didn't receive the request the day that they messaged you and say, "Hey, do you want to make this happen?" I don't know what we're doing here. I don't know what the nature of this is. Then you get Lila Rose, who jumps in for no reason at all other than the fact that she's a committed Christian Zionist. ^t-00-36-53

At least Allie's showing something relevant to Turning Point USA—even though she maybe didn't watch what I said or she's confused about what the conversation was. It's well-meaning, okay? Lila Rose just comes out of left field with like: we're talking about apples, and here's an orange. "I speak regularly on college campuses as well." She starts with: "This is not true. This is not true." What is not true? I showed the email. What is not true? "I speak regularly at college campuses as well. As one example, I was just asked to speak at Stanford, and they were going to set the event up within three weeks." It didn't happen—didn't materialize. They asked you to speak. What's the context? How many students? And then she goes on, and she gives an example. ^t-00-37-33

Okay, so this is what happens when the chief debater— Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) is murdered. We're left with this: people who can't think through the apples and the oranges. Lila: I am sure that if Taylor Swift tweets that it took her team a year to put together her tour, I'm not going to respond and be like, "This is not true. I toured Taylor Swift at campus events, and we were able to pull the event together in six months." Apples, oranges. So that Yale event that Lila Rose spoke at was with the Yale Political Union. ^t-00-38-16

It runs like a well-oiled machine. I've spoken at the Oxford Union. They speak in the same place at the same time. They change the people that are speaking. You sit down with them; you have a dinner. This is Oxford again, not Yale. I've not spoken at Yale. You have a dinner, and you debate somebody, okay? It's a debate union. It's what they do, and what they've been doing since 1934. Lila had—and here's a picture of it—she's comparing this—70 people that attended this debate—to Turning Point USA hosting a debate with thousands of people, sometimes a vice president, sometimes a president. Like, you just—what are you debating? What are you actually—like, when you pause and you think through—what are you debating me on? ^t-00-38-57

Absolutely. But these events are big. Okay: ambulances are required. The university has to tell you: "Okay, well, if you've got 1,500 people, then this is the state law." They have to confirm they're available. "This is the insurance that has to be," but blah, blah, blah, blah. Not the same thing, Lila, when you are debating an older woman regarding abortion in a political union, okay? It's just not the same. So again, I ask: what is their investment ^t-00-39-41

I can do every semester from 2018 until 2024. What's the point here? I'm gonna do it. Savannah, I'm sorry: we have to do this. But what's the point of disputing something and saying something is not true when I just told you it's true, and I showed you evidence that it's true? You're not even saying—you're just lying, actually, at that point. You're being extremely dishonest at the very least to make a video and say, "He's not becoming Catholic.

Now, is it possible that somebody knew somebody and made a phone call and made it happen? Yeah. But we—the public around the world who don't trust what we are being told—would like to know who that somebody was that made that event come together very quickly, faster than I've ever seen an event come together given how universities act with hostility toward conservative groups that host a lot of people—which is what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was, who Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was as a person. He was somebody that was met with hostility by administrations when he went there, okay? ^t-00-41-08

They will burn you in effigy—as they did to Michael Knowles at a Turning Point USA event. So there has to be certain parameters that are set to allow these particular events to happen. But I appreciate you sharing your experience. And the next time Taylor Swift tweets about her experience, I'm going to just be like, "Not true. Not true to Taylor Swift." It's like: "I—you know—I can't walk into the mall." I mean, like: me neither. That's not true. I walked in. No fans ran up at me, Taylor Swift. So obviously Taylor Swift's lying because it didn't happen to me. It doesn't. As Justin Bieber says: it's just—it's not clocking for us, man. Anyways, it is weird to me also that when you look at what they focus on, it seems so petty—but then they look over all of the glaringly obvious lies that were being told about this investigation. ^t-00-41-49

They don't care about any of that stuff. So are you doing this because you care about Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Are you doing this because you care about the investigation? Because if you're going to investigate, investigate. Okay. Send me a text message and ask me a specific question and say, "Where'd you get this information from?" Join the team of people online who I never knew before this—who are investigating this murder and using sources. Do that. Either join us or get out of our way—is what I would say—because if you're not going to make a video—or you are going to make a video about a glaring obvious hole and then just pooh-pooh it—which is kind of what Allie did regarding the fed Discord messages. ^t-00-42-32

She like softens it and says, "Well, even if these are written by the feds, I still think he was murdered by Tyler Robinson." Okay, so you're willing to—what?—give grace to the feds when they're maybe lying, but you can't assume that I'm telling the truth about my experience having worked with an organization and the actual evidence that I have to back up what I'm saying? You have no grace on the matter of whether or not he might've been getting curious about Catholicism. Is the goal to tell the truth, okay?

When we drop the text messages, did you do a show and go, "Wow, Josh Hammer really lied about Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) mindset?"

I'm investigating this; I care about it. And it is my perspective that if you're in my way, I'm just gonna breathe fire and expose the truth. When I say breathe fire, it just means showing the truth—showing more truth. I'm gonna pull up—like I said—every email so that there is no debate or dispute about how long it takes for these events to go together, okay? Yeah, that's that.

Like, she's one of these people that keeps a folder on her desk, and she intentionally has out-of-context clips which she then sends to people—a whole little orbit of bees online like Ian Miles Cheong—who's like a despicable human being—and says like, "Attack this person."

I'm happy to do that and bring the evidence of what I'm saying. That always stands open. You will have a platform if you are committed to truth. My platform is your platform.

This gets back into—you know—Erika Kirk as a CEO. People are... We watched her lie, okay? We watched her lie about the Catholic thing. We're supposed to just feel good about that and think that she's traumatized—but she wasn't traumatized when she like wore boots and stood outside for Wall Street Journal to click a picture of her a couple of days after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died. I don't know. It feels like she was good. And she's a star now and tried to hard-launch her podcast. She actually tweeted a couple of things the last couple of days—dripping with anger towards people that are asking meaningful questions. Here's one thing she wrote. "Let me tell you something about Mikey. ^t-00-46-03

Just kidding; she didn't say that. "I'm one of the longest-tenured employees now at the organization, and Mikey has a servant's heart— if ever I've seen one. You know why he went to Korea and Japan? Because my boss—our production director—who is the father of six children—asked him to. He is always traveling with me—a good portion of it—and he missed his kids, and he asked Mikey to please go and film instead." Okay, I'm just gonna say: I think he probably went to Japan and Korea because it's an awesome opportunity. I don't know. I'm just a person who's been around a lot. And if I said, "Hey, do you guys want to go to Japan?" Hip hip hooray—it's amazing.

And so I don't understand why we just can't get basic answers about Mikey McCoy that would allow us to just move on from how we are feeling about his behavior following things—and the things that were said about him following things—which make us feel like they were priming him to take over for Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And we heard these things from his father. We heard these things from people at Turning Point USA. And if you're looking for a fact: he took over for Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—who was slated to speak at Liberty University. Okay, that's just a fact. Alex Clark also threw shade at us, and it's kind of incredible that she said this working for Turning Point USA. ^t-00-47-31

"Oh, on every podcast tribute episode I did about Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I did not run my ad sponsorships. My directive and choice to my team. We are now in debt to my sponsors. I didn't care. It felt like the right thing to do." Okay, so... Turning Point made something like $90 million in the couple of weeks following Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) death. I think at first it was $70 million. It's gone up since then. They were selling like t-shirts at the memorial event—like "Freedom Charlie" t-shirts. They were selling products.

Now, first and foremost: on our tribute episode, we ran absolutely zero ads. We didn't even let YouTube run ads on that episode. So this is not a tribute episode. This is my podcast, and we're investigating this murder. And every person who is doing podcasts—whether it's Allie speaking about his Catholic journey, Lila speaking about what happens, whatever context they're putting it into, whether it's PBD and his team—which spoke a lot about Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) after he died— why are you looking at me as being the person who's reading my ads?

I declined to do— what was the total amount that you postponed, by the way? Because you didn't decline it. You postponed having to read ads and said that you made them up later." It's just—there's something that really bothers me about this. They're angry at people who are investigating Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) death and catching them in lies. That's why she's mad.

"Oh, we do this every—" No: you don't do a Doge every year. Do I know how I know that? Because Doge didn't exist before Elon Musk. So it's like: what are you saying? They want us to pretend we're really dumb, and it's emotionally manipulative for them to be like, "That's how you honor Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Pretend to be an idiot.

Yes: I did say that. I didn't say that Mikey murdered Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). I said Turning Point is engaged in a cover-up because that is literally the only reason that people lie. Anytime you lie, it's because you're covering up the truth. You're engaging in a cover-up—even if it's a white lie. Even if I say—you know—I'm trying to surprise a friend for a birthday party, and I tell her, "I'm the only one that's gonna be there; meet me here"—it's a lie because I'm covering up a certain truth, right? ^t-00-51-06

There is no other reason to lie unless you're covering something up. So you—when you lied about the Catholicism thing—it wasn't because you murdered Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), Alex; it was because likely you guys were more concerned with your Christian Zionist donors and also pressure from your Jewish donors. And so you just lied to cover up the truth about where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was at. Turning Point USA is telling a lot of lies. They're engaging in a cover-up.

It literally is God time, okay? All of this stuff—and that's how she operates, by the way. She can treat you really evil, but there's an NDA preventing you, so you got to allow her to abuse you. We're not doing this anymore, Alyssa. We're not doing this anymore. ^t-00-55-48

You are no longer allowed to engage in sheer evil. You are no longer allowed to behave like Satan's children and then make little legal threats, okay? Anything that gets sent to me from a lawyer is now publicized. That's it. Don't care who you are. If you're watching this and you're going, "Should I send it to a lawyer?" You probably should. Anything that you send to me is now public. Satan's time is done. It's done, okay? Shouldn't have shot Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). Just shouldn't have killed Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). That's what I would say. Anyways, top comment from yesterday was: "Somewhere Brigitte Macron is breathing a sigh of relief." I don't know, man. Now that the podcast has gone number one, people are gonna go back and watch the Brigitte Macron series—and once you watch it, you just know. ^t-00-56-33

Such a bizarre thing. Like, the media's been lying about that. It's like a really big secret. It's like it's the elephant in the room. Dinesh D'Souza, by the way, added this on X. He wrote: "At this point, anyone who follows this freak show is doing it for the entertainment. This is not political commentary. It's midget bowling." Why does he always write weird stuff? Hard to watch but hard to look away from because there's a midget flying down the aisle heading for pins. Dinesh: where are you seeing all this stuff? Before he made the reference to a goat having sex with a human—and he keeps using these weird analogies like: "I just think they got to look at his hard drive." ^t-00-57-14

I'm going to call the FBI. I'm going to call Kash Patel if he's done crying about the mean tweets on the internet for his girlfriend—and I'm going to call the FBI. Anyways, going back into some of your comments: we have Just Keep in Faith writes: "When you said you are the number one podcast in the world, it brought a tear to my eye. But I knew that." I mean: I didn't know—no—but I knew. Honestly, it brought a tear to my eye when I found out because we've just been fighting, and we don't look up and look at the stats and follow the stats every day. And we obviously knew that we had become in like the top three podcasts pretty quickly in the United States. ^t-00-57-54

And that really felt like this moment. So I was very, very excited. Thank you guys so much for supporting us and allowing us to be truly independent. Michael Reese writes from East Tennessee: "To you. We are German. We appreciate your work. Keep standing up to the 7K club. We have your back." Michael and Wayne: thank you so much. Michael and Wayne: I will continue to stand up to them, and I think we are winning because they're very angry—and I don't even know what they're attacking me over at this point. ^t-00-58-34

I do wish there was some sign that we could detect that she sees the lies that we see— we, as in the millions upon millions making you the number one podcaster." Yeah: we're—I'm hopeful in the future. We are going to know what she knows. Obviously she is privy—as next of kin—to the lawsuits. She's privy— I'm sorry—to the prosecution. ^t-00-59-04

Everything we have seen has just been—I don't know—it's just—it's been one big nothing burger. Tom Paul writes: "Andrew Colbert on Alex Clark show discussed how Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) heart was still beating. How did Charlie (Charlie Kirk) instantly go to heaven if he had a pulse? Erika first saw Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at an airport in Israel in May of 2018 with her mom. There is an old video of her talking about it." Yeah, I think I saw that video. I think they spoke about that even in other videos they'd done together. I think I was with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), by the way. That might have been for the embassy opening. I don't remember anything, though, in my memory. I promise: after having children, I can't remember specific things. I always have to go back and check an email. ^t-00-59-48

I'm not positive. Yes: regarding that heart still beating if he instantly went to heaven. Didn't Andrew offer up an explanation? This was kind of one of the things that people were asking: how did he go into surgery? Because they explained that he had died instantly. It wasn't just Erika, by the way: Frank Turek said it on stage—that he knew in the car that he was gone. But maybe he still had a pulse. Again: this would be a great thing—since they mentioned it—for Andrew or Frank Turek to respond to. It's a very easy thing for them to respond to to clear up some confusion.

Christ is King." Gang. I really do love that it feels like we are in a moment of truth and light. A lot is being revealed. It can feel stressful. It is certainly frustrating—especially for me—to have myself constantly taken out of context and to have people just so willfully lying about me telling the truth. But I do know that there's just something else happening spiritually right now, and we are all barreling toward the light. I really do feel that way. The demons shriek the loudest when they are in the light. Brad Atkins writes: "Praying for you in South Carolina. The Lord Jesus Christ is King." ^t-01-01-17

MD Turner writes: "You are top even though Australian moronic leaders won't let you in. Keep at them." Well, I get to reapply in like a year or so, so maybe I'll try to come again down under. Good Bean writes: "Time will inevitably lessen the sting of losing Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Our brains are designed this way for our protection. So please do not let the little foxes distract you from the mission. Got your back. Let's go, Candace-O." Thank you so much. I am not distracted. This is the one thing they can't distract me on. Trust me. They have no power here, truly. When it comes to figuring out what happened, I will be relentless. ^t-01-01-58

Brigitte Macron—I mean, that's a broader issue with perverts in power. But this one is—it is just so sinister, so evil; it's incomprehensible to consider what must be true to allow for all of this shade that the people who are asking questions are getting. And I just have known since the very beginning that this is not going to be like JFK. We are actually going to get answers. This is going to be solved. And that's why they're worried because we won't let it go. We will not let it go. Arm Hanna writes: "Candace, that was such a wise statement. I cannot forgive until I know what I am forgiving." Thank you for saying it. I just obviously—I just speak to you guys and whatever's on my heart—and that is how I think I feel because I'm like: what is wrong with me? ^t-01-02-42

And that's the answer. I don't know what I'm forgiving. Who am I forgiving? How do you say, "I forgive you"? I'm talking about myself here. If I don't know who I should be forgiving, I need to get there. She continues: "Everyone wrestles with God no matter how devoted they are to their faith. I hope the truth prevails. Christ is King." Maria writes: "Thank you for keeping it real. Never let anyone impede your gut feelings. When your soul feels something is off, it's off." Facts. Yes: we are designed that way. Our gut is our God instinct. We're being lied to by a lot of people—and people that I feel like we shouldn't be lied to by are lying to us. ^t-01-03-27

Form a coalition: share editors, push promotion, and spark Occupy Wall Street 2.0 and the Fed. Fulfill Tupac's dream of a new party." I think I'm so traumatized from being at—and like working for—somebody else that I don't know if I could ever work for anybody else. But forming a coalition and helping each other— we already do behind the scenes. I haven't done that with Jimmy Dore, but anything these other people— Ian Carroll: we text regularly. Dave Smith: we text regularly when we're sharing information or asking each other questions or asking for guidance. And I look up to these people for what they're doing. ^t-01-04-11

And I know that we are like in a line united, and there is like an army that's rising—and it feels to me like it is the army of God. I'd love to do work with Jimmy Dore. I have loved his videos, and he has made me laugh in his coverage of the absurd things that we are being told about the Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) assassination. Mina Barbie writes: "Hi Candace: my name is Mina. You have made such a positive impact on my life. Today is my birthday, and it would mean so much if you said happy birthday. Love you. God bless." Happy birthday, Mina. I hope you have a fantastic day. Your birthday already has great vibes because we are number one podcast in the world. So we will not forget your birthday. We will not forget November 6th. We will not forget it. It's a major win. We should be happy. ^t-01-04-53

We can brag a little bit—but I am bragging from a true place of humility because I know that we would not have done this without you guys. You have the craziness behind the scenes—even me making like my team coming with me from Daily Wire. And there was a member—Skylar—messaging me being like: "Okay, are you going to like write me— offer an email? Like I don't know what I'm doing." I said: "You would offer to what?" And gratefully my husband pulled it all together. But these are now really fond memories because—you know—I told them: "I don't know how it's going to work out. We can't offer you health insurance in the first year. It could fail. ^t-01-05-39

Go speak to your families and see if that's something that you want to do." And they said yes. And now we're the number one podcast in the world. So they took a chance on me, and we've busted our butts—and here's where we're at. So thank you guys for supporting us on this journey to my original Stan's Cup owners—the first white "Christ is King" Stan's Cup. I see you; I love you guys. You guys were here early, and I've been on this journey. And so that feels good as well. I don't know what I'll say other than book club people—everybody that signed up on the website, candaceowens.com. And we didn't know what we were doing. Just: I love you. ^t-01-06-23
