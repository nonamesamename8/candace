Happy Thursday, and some breaking news for you, because I knew it. Candace Owens: I knew it. Candace Owens: I didn't know it, but I knew it. Candace Owens: And now, ladies and gentlemen, I know it. Candace Owens: Oh, there were some Egyptian military men that were on the ground on September 10th in Utah, on the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Candace Owens: And we now need to demand that they publicly release details of who those individuals were and why they were there. Candace Owens: This is huge. Candace Owens: Okay. Candace Owens: In other news, Zionists are going crazy like they are every day. Candace Owens: They really Candace Owens: do not want us investigating Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s murder for some unknown reason. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=41" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-00-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Candace Owens: They want us to stop noticing that there are so many issues in the story that they're trying to sell us. Candace Owens: And now they're up in arms demanding that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) gets canceled from all future Turning Point USA conferences. Candace Owens: And you're never going to guess how they're trying to spin this. Candace Owens: Well, you probably will guess. Candace Owens: It's anti-Semitism. Candace Owens: Welcome back to Candace (Candace Owens). Candace Owens: All right, so while I was away in Wyoming, I received a rather shocking tip. ^t-00-00-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=82" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-01-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Candace Owens: There were, as I am sure you are aware, some inexplicable flights that were happening that day. Candace Owens: And actually, they're not even inexplicable. Candace Owens: They could very easily be explained. Candace Owens: It's just that the feds are kind of declining to do so. Candace Owens: And we don't really have much information about those flights. Candace Owens: In particular, there was one flight Candace Owens: that had a—I would say—described as an interesting morning. Candace Owens: It was contracted by our military for whatever reason. This plane departed from the Biggs Army Airfield at 6:13 a.m. That's down in El Paso, Texas, right? Candace Owens: And despite the fact that they were heading to Montana, they decided to make an unusual dip at 9:16 a.m. Again, this is in Utah time. ^t-00-01-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=127" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-02-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Candace Owens: Okay, we're doing all this in mountain time. Candace Owens: They dipped down to just 300 feet above ground over the Provo airport runway, and they made a loop. Candace Owens: I'm going to show you a screenshot here. This is from FlightRadar. Candace Owens: So you can see that loop. Candace Owens: And again, this is a military plane, a military-contracted plane. Candace Owens: And we know it's military because it's leaving from a military base. Candace Owens: Okay. Candace Owens: Really interesting thing happening there. Candace Owens: Mark, if you want to jump on right now, just to describe this for all the women that are listening to this podcast—what we're seeing here with that chart on the bottom. Candace Owens: Happy to provide some mansplaining. Candace Owens: So at the bottom, you can see the altitude and the airspeed of the plane. ^t-00-02-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=168" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-02-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Candace Owens: You see it take off, goes to level flight, and then you see it dip down in the middle there. Candace Owens: And that's what we're looking at. Candace Owens: The time on there says 3:16 p.m., but that's UTC. Candace Owens: That's just the general time for airplanes. Candace Owens: So you go back minus six hours to give you Utah time. Candace Owens: So that gives us 9:16 a.m. And then it goes back up and then continues to Montana. Candace Owens: Okay, so it continued on to Kalispell, Montana, and then it lands for just under an hour before it again departs back for Texas once again on its return trip. Candace Owens: It dips again to just over 300 feet over the Provo Airport runway. Candace Owens: We're going to show you that again. ^t-00-02-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=211" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-03-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Candace Owens: This is from FlightRadar—that dip. I should tell you, because there has been a lot of speculation about it online, Candace Owens: that took place approximately 26 minutes after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. Candace Owens: So that dip took place 26 minutes after. Candace Owens: And then the plane went back home or back to the home base in El Paso. Candace Owens: Now, it's possible—just to be fair here—that the plane was running a military training exercise that morning. Candace Owens: Maybe they were training a new pilot on how to make a fake landing or something. Candace Owens: I really don't know. Candace Owens: But this flight path did indeed happen. Candace Owens: We can confirm that. ^t-00-03-31

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=252" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-04-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Candace Owens: And it has been accurately reported that the plane is owned by a certain LSAI LLC—L-A-S-A-I L-L-C—regarding which there haven't been any more details provided because this has not exactly been the most transparent administration, as they claim they were going to be. Candace Owens: The second mysterious flight, which was well reported on at the time—I would say this was the most reported-upon flight again by the public and which eventually created so much pressure that it warranted a response from one of the owners of the plane, who was Derek Maxfield. Candace Owens: He's married to Shalane Maxfield. Candace Owens: The two of them—they're a billionaire couple Candace Owens: from Utah. They run—now they run—a human sex trafficking charity. ^t-00-04-12

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=295" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-04-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Candace Owens: There's a lot of human sex trafficking charities in Utah. Candace Owens: And I should let you guys know that they are not the only owners of that plane, by the way. Candace Owens: Someone who didn't hit internet radar who also co-owns that plane with them is a person named Casey Baugh—B-A-U-G-H. Now, I'm mentioning Casey Baugh because I found it—when I was researching—interesting that Casey Baugh has his name on an institute Candace Owens: at UVU, the Baugh Entrepreneurship Institute, which operates out of the Woodbury Business Building. Candace Owens: Okay, I was like, whoa. When we didn't know any details, I was thinking like, hey, did this person let somebody onto the rooftop? Candace Owens: But of course now we know that Tyler Robinson was not on the Woodbury Building or ^t-00-04-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=340" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-05-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Candace Owens: on campus at all for that matter. Candace Owens: So Casey Baugh is not a suspect for having provided him access in any way. Candace Owens: But I will say that the Baugh-Maxfield plane—I'm gonna take you through what that was doing. It caught a ton of attention because the plane departed from Provo, Utah at 1:20 p.m. local time. Candace Owens: In theory then, of course, yes, a person could have shot Charlie (Charlie Kirk), went straight to the airport, and then took off on a private plane. Candace Owens: And why this got even more attention was because they seemingly turned their transponder off. Candace Owens: That alarmed the public. Candace Owens: Why is this plane terminating their transponder? Candace Owens: Why don't we know—why can't we see more data happening on this plane, right? Candace Owens: Being collected from this plane. ^t-00-05-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=385" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-06-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Candace Owens: So obviously this couple, Derek and Shalane Maxfield, were feeling the heat, And they said that contrary to a lot of the online conspiracies that were taking shape, the plane was actually empty when it departed Provo en route to Arizona, where he and some of his friends were picked up, and they were turned home to Provo. Okay. Some people thought, did they pick up like Turning Point USA people? And return back. We don't know at all actually who was on that flight manifest. In theory, it's not really our business, but of course, given this high-profile assassination, it feels like everything should be our business. ^t-00-06-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=425" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-07-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Anyways, here's what he said specifically. I'm going to read his statement in its entirety, for good measure. He wrote, "Shalane and I join our community, our state, and our nation in mourning the death of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and we pray for his family and loved ones during this difficult and tragic time. His death and the way that it occurred was both horrifying and senseless. We pray that the extensive efforts by law enforcement to locate Mr. Kirk's killer will be swift and successful." Spoiler alert: no, it has not been. "As often happens, unfortunately, in the wake of such terrifying and public events, a variety of baseless theories and suspicions around Mr. Kirk's murder immediately took hold on social media, including one that has unfairly impacted our family. To set the record straight, we provide the following facts. ^t-00-07-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=467" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-07-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Yesterday at 1 p.m. Mountain Time, a private aircraft owned by one of our companies with the tail number N888KG departed the Provo Airport for Page, Arizona. Pursuant to a pre-scheduled flight plan, occupants at takeoff included two pilots and no passengers. That tail number arrived at Page, Arizona airport at approximately 1 p.m. Mountain Time. At 12:55 p.m. local time upon arrival, I, Derek Maxfield, boarded that plane along with seven additional passengers for the return trip to Provo. We departed at PGA Airport in Arizona at approximately 1:40 and arrived at PVU at approximately 3:15 p.m. Mountain Time. ^t-00-07-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=509" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-08-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Radar services with air traffic control were terminated in mutual agreement between Denver FAA Center and N888KG approximately 10 miles from landing at PGA, which is consistent with generally accepted standard practice when flying in and out of non-towered airports like PGA. N888KG pilots followed all FAA requirements and protocols, tower directions, and the predetermined flight plan. This round trip was made at my request and solely for my purposes. Any suggestion that the flights by N888KG yesterday are in any way connected to the tragic shooting of Mr. Kirk is inaccurate, false, and without any credible basis of any kind. ^t-00-08-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=553" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-09-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** To our knowledge, no one associated with yesterday's flight by N888KG has been contacted by law enforcement for any reason." And then they just say, "We ask that you still—you just focus on bringing the people—bring Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to justice, the murder of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), finding some justice in that," okay. So a couple of interesting things. He admits that—like something like—the services were terminated, but in compliance with law. So they didn't break the law when they did that at all. And what I can tell you is that I had a flurry of pilots that were working on getting details on that flight manifest, confirming its landing, et cetera. And things got a little bit weird. ^t-00-09-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=593" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-09-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** They were saying that it was unusual that stuff that was pretty standard protocol—the feds seem to be guarding. Very strange. Now I'm not saying this to implicate Derek Maxfield or Shalane Maxfield at all. In fact, that's why I wanted to read their statement in its entirety. But I am telling you that the feds were guarding this just like they were guarding the Dairy Queen. It was weird. Even airport personnel had been instructed to lie, actually. Situation was therefore not routine. And if you haven't caught on, I'm not really here for all of these extraordinary anomalies that just keep happening, right? Information is power. We want the information so we can dispel the rumor. I don't see any reason, by the way, Derek and Shalane—if you want to reach out to me and tell me personally who was on the manifest and I can just say— ^t-00-09-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=636" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-10-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I actually haven't offered you that until this moment. I would be glad to dispel all the rumors and innuendo. If the feds are telling the airport to lie for some reason—there was one person who said they were supposed to land at Million Air FBO, but then suddenly they shifted to another FBO and things were weird. I would be happy to clear up everything for you in a way that makes sense. And it could genuinely be because the government is so inefficient. Major point that I wanna make here is that the biggest anomaly that has happened is this kind of foreign angle. Like right away, they just got out in front of it and were like, there's nothing to see here. And we discovered—and I broke the story—that there was actually a third plane, which I found to be quite odd. ^t-00-10-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=679" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-11-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I reported on it, and the Zionists immediately seemed to me too panicked, right? They issued what I describe as a false debunking regarding the point that I was making. What they do in terms like that is when you say something that's really big, they focus on something really small and inconsequential—like an error that you made— and I did make in terms of time zones—and they go, oh, well, this has been debunked, right? It's been completely debunked. You saw this in the Brigitte case. ^t-00-11-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=709" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-11-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** She started going after people for defamation—not people that wasn't attacking them for the substance of the claim that you were born male because she was—but rather she goes after them like she's going after me for saying, oh, well, actually you're saying that I stole my sister's ID and that's a crime, so I'm gonna sue you for that. And then the media runs with it and says, oh, this has been debunked. Nothing is being debunked. And when they do that—when they focus on that—you know they're hiding something, okay? When they focus on something that's totally inconsequential, a minor mistake that you make, they're hiding something. So I reported that on the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, an Egyptian Air Force plane took off from Provo, Utah airport. ^t-00-11-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=749" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-12-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I reported that even more curiously that Egyptian military plane had previously only ever been to the United States twice in that past year. And both times it was in the lead-up—in the weeks leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Okay, here is that plane. The tail number you can see here is SUBTT. And this is a screenshot again from FlightRadar. ^t-00-12-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=773" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-12-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, of course, when I pointed out that this foreign military plane arrived on September 4th—so six days before—into Provo, Utah, and departed six days later on September 10th, they ignored the huge substance of this, which is why is this Egyptian military plane here in the middle of Utah. Instead, they said, oh, she made a time zone mistake. Like as if I'm on FlightRadar every day, accustomed to reading the data here. Yeah, I thought that I was looking at mountain time—like local time—on FlightRadar. As Mark just explained, no, they do it according to universal time. Okay, big deal. Like actually big deal. ^t-00-12-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=816" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-13-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Then I saw that the one random Twitter user that caught that mistake suddenly got boosted in the algorithm, and they made it a trending story. Like it was like, trending story: this has been debunked. And I was like, ah, I've been telling you guys for a while, the military runs X—like not Elon Musk, the military. These are military bots that you're seeing on X. But that was essentially the vibe. Egyptian military plane: don't look over here. We have debunked. It has nothing to do with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) conspiracy theory because she got the time zone wrong. It was actually the flight departed a couple of hours earlier than she said. Okay, you know me—that just makes me more curious. Anytime you see a Snopes-level debunking—as I like to term it—it means you're onto something. ^t-00-13-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=858" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-14-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Anyways, I was going through the DCIA tips box—our decentralized intelligence agency tips box—and I found a very interesting email. I'm gonna be very careful here to make sure I don't give this person away, but it was someone from a foreign country. They wrote us claiming to have intimate knowledge regarding the flight. And you can take what I'm about to tell you to the bank, okay? In fact, you can even take this as a direct challenge to Kash Patel to dispute what I am going to say. Thus far, have you noticed that no one has done that? Like when I say something, they go, she must be lying. Oh, the screenshots must be fake. This is obviously—Charlie (Charlie Kirk) didn't say this. Oh, the thing is lying about the Catholic thing. ^t-00-14-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=902" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-15-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Oh, but nobody's doing any debunking here because I make sure always that I have solid proof of what I am saying before I say it. I feel that I have been presented with absolute solid proof from this individual who is in proximity to one of the individuals that was aboard this flight. I can now report to you that it is a fact that on 9/4, this was not some dropping by in Utah as they were trying to claim because the plane needed to be serviced. That's what they ran with. They ran with, this could have been a routine servicing. ^t-00-15-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=942" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-15-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I guess there's just no place from Egypt all the way to Utah that an Egyptian military plane can like get a tire changed. This is totally routine—nothing to see here. Well, I'm telling you that for a fact, that plane was carrying military subcontractors. And for a fact, they were dropped off in Provo, okay? And that they did not make it back to Cairo. They showed you—I showed you—the plane left. They left on September 10th. It then laid over in Wilmington, Delaware, and departed back for Cairo on the 11th. ^t-00-15-42

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=982" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-16-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I am telling you that when that plane left, okay, those people were mysteriously missing from that plane. Okay. What's going on here? Why are Egyptian military subcontractors—what are Egyptian military subcontractors doing in the middle of Provo, Utah on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated? Okay. Again, I am saying as a fact, Kash Patel—please feel free to dispute this. In fact, I almost demand that you dispute it. I think you must. You've been saying everybody's conspiracies are dangerous. Thinking is dangerous. ^t-00-16-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=1026" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-17-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That aircraft was not in Utah for any routine servicing, okay? Rather extraordinarily, this person told me that it was there on some discrete mission— so discreet that this individual was scared for their life to present this information, but felt compelled to present it because they too were horrified like the rest of the world. Again, the mistake that was made here was executing him publicly. People felt something, right? They felt something. They understood that whatever happened here was a tremendous act of evil. ^t-00-17-06

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=1066" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-17-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And so what it led to was goodness—more goodness, more people standing up and doing something brave and saying, we need to root out this evil from our society. What were they doing there? When did they leave? Who are these individuals? I don't understand, Kash Patel. Tell us about this flight. Tell us who was on it, okay? I wanted to be very thorough here in presenting this information. So I was like, let's actually upgrade our FlightRadar account so we can go back three years on this plane's flight history—which is really the max setting that you can have on FlightRadar if you get a business account. ^t-00-17-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=1104" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-18-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And here is what we pulled together for you guys so that you don't have to pay for a business account—which is way too expensive, especially for me who doesn't actually use FlightRadar often—but I am doing whatever I can to solve the murder of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Here it is. Three years—you can see November 2022. We can go back as far as November and December of that year. We can see that it routinely flies through Paris. And I noticed—and you can take your time to freeze this and go through everything, as I'm not gonna read it all—I noticed that the trend here is that it always flies to an Air Force base, okay? Look in 2025. If you look under 2025, you will see this is what it did. ^t-00-18-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=1147" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-19-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It went from September 4th—it went from Cairo to Paris to France to Minot, North Dakota. On September 10th, it departed Provo—I think I'm missing one here, right? It didn't—no, it departed. That's right: September 10th, it departed Provo, Utah at 7:14 a.m. local time. Okay? And I am telling you that aboard that plane, it was not the same people that got onto that plane. Okay, that is what I am told by this individual. ^t-00-19-07

I would not have taken this to the bank. I had to really walk her through having the courage to do this any further. And I am certain that this happened. And I am certain—I feel like the rest of us feel—that we are not getting a full picture. Now, I will again stress that this individual never ever said that the mission—the secret mission—was related to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). In fact, they were explicit that they weren't entirely sure what the specific mission was, but that it was top secret. ^t-00-19-42

And when you couple that information with what was trending yesterday, right? This is the headline that came out of the Daily Mail. "Kash Patel shuts down Charlie (Charlie Kirk) foreign intelligence probe in an explosive feud with Trump's counter-terror chief." It really makes you wonder what Kash Patel is hiding. There's actually no reason for Kash Patel to say, only I'm the person that's supposed to be looking into this. It makes no sense. ^t-00-21-04

Everyone across all departments would be locking arms and saying, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a wonderful friend. He did everything he could to put this administration into power. In fact, Trump (Donald Trump) would be late-night tweeting, being like, I don't accept this narrative. Trump (Donald Trump) would be asking questions. His sons would be asking questions. Turning Point USA executives would be asking questions. But instead, Kash Patel is saying, don't ask questions. Everything that you're hearing is a conspiracy. Homie has really turned into Dr. Fauci.

So that's the phase that we are at, where people are trying to pretend that to protect Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s legacy, we have to say less. It's the exact opposite. We have to say more. And again, I am personally challenging you, Kash Patel, and your super transparent—super transparent—administration to dispute what I'm saying.

I'm not positive, but I have a pretty good gut feeling that the way that they behaved when I pointed out this flight—which is to lie and to explain nothing—means that they are scared and has them shook.

I, of course, have dealt with that myself, but I have also seen something else, which is a lot of courage right now in this moment. I don't play defense anymore.

It gives her the truth that our culture does not provide. So don't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. We should be unapologetically pro-life. Head to preborn.org/Candace right now. Give $28. You can also give 10 times that amount if you can. This is the line that I think that we must stand on. We have to stand for truth and what's right.

Not to mention the fact that even according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective—whatever that means—at best. And that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is, of course, a much better way to stay healthy. So grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company. You wake up with a sore throat or you have a runny nose—you can address those symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit that contains ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, generic Tamiflu, a generic Z-Pak, and so much more.

When I said that the Egyptian flight in its past flights to America had landed on American air bases, I didn't mean they physically landed on American air bases. I meant that they landed in cities where there are Air Force bases. And the notable exception here is that Provo does not have an Air Force base.

All right, jumping into this rather hilarious story—irrespective of whether or not you personally support the nation of Israel or not. I most certainly do not.

The backstory here is that Tucker (Tucker Carlson)—in case you missed it—hosted Nick Fuentes on his show. And to be clear, I've hosted Nick Fuentes on my show. I don't like Nick Fuentes, and truly not because of anything he said in the past, because how he treated me and my team and how he lied on me after it. So I actually am judging him based on my experience with him, okay? I don't really believe in cancel culture, and it was why I platformed him in the first place. He said something when he was 18 and went through the gamut that I went through—that Tucker's going through right now. ^t-00-29-27

Not so fair for an 18-year-old kid to go through that. I've been clear about that, and that person should get a second chance to explain their story. So Tucker (Tucker Carlson) invited him on to have a conversation. And this has led to people insisting that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) gets canceled from all Turning Point future events. Now, why are they saying he should be canceled? Well, because it's so dangerous that he platformed Nick Fuentes, who has said terrible things online, and Nick Fuentes has been adversarial to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) didn't like Nick Fuentes. So why is Tucker (Tucker Carlson) speaking to him? Like that's their logic. I spoke to him. I don't like Nick Fuentes. I speak to people I don't like all the time, actually. It's a good thing to do. ^t-00-30-03

Anyways, this led to Josh Hammer—who is our resident psycho who really does look like that. Like this is not—that's not AI, okay? That's not AI. He wrote an op-ed in the Daily Mail—which they actually published—calling for Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to be neutralized.

He lied over and over and over again—plus tried to sell his book. Is he actually writing an op-ed claiming that it is Tucker (Tucker Carlson) who is apparently heinous? Yes, he's doing that. This is a direct quote from that op-ed. He wrote, "This looks like a war on MAGA and the modern American right.

The Fox is now comfortably ensconced in the henhouse, and unless the Fox is neutralized, the victim could be the entire extant GOP coalition itself." He actually wrote that. He published that.

In fact, these people were all pro-DeSantis even when Trump (Donald Trump) was up against Ron DeSantis, okay? They were against Trump (Donald Trump).

Then there was a Holocaust, and it has to be stopped. I mean, it's not even good. The level of emotional manipulation here isn't even good. It's obviously funny.

Common sense: Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in his own words. And Seth Dillon, you're aware of this because you put him through two weeks before—the struggle session in the Hamptons. What was it—August 5th and 6th? Pressing him on the things that he said about Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) and Yahoo. He was hosting people to have that discussion. But, you know— I guess for some Zionists, you would say it was almost fortunate that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is no longer here to take that last step that you knew he was taking. You didn't want another Tucker (Tucker Carlson) or Candace (Candace Owens)—people who were very much in the pro-Israel camp and left it because we could not stand your immorality. ^t-00-39-12

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=2394" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:39:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-39-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We could not stand your lies. And we could not possibly think that God's chosen people would allow it. God's chosen people don't lie. God's chosen people don't kill hundreds of thousands of people and then try to tell you that they're the victim because they're spending tons of money on Christian Zionists. And yes, it is absolutely a heresy to get up on stage and to lie about what is in the Bible—to try to use it to manipulate people and tell them that what's right here in the Bible is that they shouldn't follow Tucker (Tucker Carlson) or Candace (Candace Owens). And yes, I would deem you to be therefore a heretic. So I hope I'm clear about what I think you are—people of your ilk are—people that pretend to be Christians ^t-00-39-54

So anyways, this leads us, of course, to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s last words in that text chain. He fought tooth and nail to make sure that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) stayed on the Turning Point USA speaking list. That's the reality, okay? That's the reality. ^t-00-40-36

And I took the obvious answer, which was to slay a Goliath, right? To slay the Goliath. And somebody wrote me this email and reminded me, of course, of the narrative beyond David slaying the Goliath: David and his unique friendship with Jonathan in the Bible. And I am going to read that email to you. Somebody wrote: "Candace (Candace Owens), David and Jonathan were biblical figures from the Bible who shared a deep and profound friendship—forming a covenant of mutual support. Jonathan was the son of King Saul, and David was a shepherd who became a great warrior and future king. ^t-00-42-46

Their bond—the friendship—began after David defeated Goliath and grew into an unlikely but profound friendship. The Bible describes Jonathan's loving David as quote, his own soul and forming a covenant with him. Jonathan's loyalty was so great that he gave David his robe, his armor, and other symbols of rank—an act that has been interpreted as a transfer of succession. Jonathan repeatedly protected David from his father, Saul—warning him of the king's intentions to kill him. After Jonathan's death, David grieved deeply for his friend. ^t-00-43-28

I love that. I actually love that interpretation that I didn't even consider in that moment when I answered that question. And I just love it. I just wanted to say thank you to the person who wrote the email. And then you consider that it really is about honoring your friend and properly grieving for your friend and realizing that you will not be able to be perceived as someone who even cared about the individual if you don't fight for them—if you don't stand up for them— if you don't look after their legacy, take care of their legacy—don't allow these people like the Josh Hammers and the Seth Dillons to try to invade and quite literally turn Charlie (Charlie Kirk) into someone he is not—not for a single second. ^t-00-44-13

It is so beyond the realm of possibility that it is sickening to watch them do this. It really shows you—for those of you that are in my book club—what I was talking about when we read that last book about how they do this after death. They fight for the person's legacy—even though they were the very same people who were harassing them: the very same people that were making Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ill with the threats, with the money—who were pressing him at the Hamptons. Seth Dillon, Josh Hammer on the text—hearing what he was going through, seeing what he was going through—will then say, oh, I proclaim myself in charge of that person's legacy. ^t-00-44-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=3106" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:51:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-51-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Unlike a HELOC—which can have varied interest rates—the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment—giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing today and start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210 or visit americanfinancing.net/Owens—americanfinancing.net/Owens. And as always, I tell you guys about Nimi Skincare. They are my favorites because the beauty industry has been telling us for years that we need all of these complex formulas to achieve healthy skin, and that's just not true. ^t-00-51-46

Nimi is doing something that I guess is radical by building one of the most popular lines that they have around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients that's on earth—which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils—which means your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Nimi has two products from their tallow line that you should definitely know about. For your daily hydration, there's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light, it absorbs quickly, and does not leave you with that greasy feeling. They've combined the tallow with a soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil. It is perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind. Then for the problem areas, ^t-00-52-24

It's an ultra-rich balm that uses tallow and beeswax to create a protective barrier. It locks in moisture, it shields your skin from the elements, and it allows it to heal. This is skincare the way that it was meant to be—which is simple, pure, and powerfully effective. It's a focus on skin-loving ingredients—which is made right here in the USA, by the way. To order, go to NemiSkincare.com. Explore their tallow line and use my code CANDACE10 at checkout to get 10% off your order. That's N-E-M-I skincare.com. ^t-00-53-02

I have it. It is beautiful. We don't know. No, but we know. I told you we restocked them. I think we still have some online. Also the book. I am so happy. Make Him a Sandwich is finally out. It really was a labor of love. You guys can head to makehimasandwich.com. If you would like to support my work—my independent work—I am not yet funded by Qatar. I'm desperate to be funded by Qatar. I don't know why they won't call me. Anyways, makehimasandwich.com. If you would like to read the book, it's a good one. I promise you—you're gonna really enjoy it. A couple of more comments here. Sister Bethy writes: "Candace (Candace Owens), I am on the floor." I think just generally the screenshot of Josh Hammer—which is going to deeply upset Seth Dillon. She was so mean—so mean. Caitlin writes: "Hey, Candace (Candace Owens), I'm a huge fan, and I believe all of what you say is true and genuine. ^t-00-53-44

Are you unable to lay it out all at once for us? And what can be done about Kash's corruption?" Yes, I am obviously drip-feeding. That would—it would not be smart for me to tell them everything that I know because I am trying to figure out who the rats are on the ship. And that is why I've been intentionally setting bait—giving a little bit of information and allowing them to lie. That is just the smart way to go about this, obviously—because I know that there's rats on the ship. Some I know for certain, but if I out those people, then the other ones can protect themselves and distance themselves. I don't know everybody that is on the ship—and who has betrayed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So this is the process that we are going through. ^t-00-54-27

And so there's kind of two running investigations: who betrayed Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I—by the way—make the argument that everyone is betraying him right now by not speaking out and telling the truth. I would say that, right? And then there's the other element of who actually killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Carrie Jean writes: "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) saw you as his David. And one Samuel: Jonathan loved David like his own soul, protected him, handed him the robe and sword of kingship. He died young—never seeing the throne. But David finished the fight—wield the sword, finished the fight." Love that. Thank you so much. I think you might have been the person that wrote me the email yesterday. I can't remember if it was Carrie. ^t-00-55-12

What is that? Mark, help me mansplain. After and Hades, the tail number N1098L is so concerning since there are now Israeli defense companies that are making air-launched drones for recon and as loitering munitions. Be well, Sister Crisis King. So that second plane is a LSAI LLC. He's talking about N1098L. He is saying is concerning because now that plane—which flew up to Montana and turned around—he is claiming (and I have not fact-checked this) is being used by Israeli defense companies. I'll have to look into that. ^t-00-55-55

I know a lot of people said the plane was flying over at that exact moment, but it was actually in Idaho. Right. 20 minutes—about 20 minutes out, right? He didn't get over Provo until 20 minutes after he was shot, right? That's what I said earlier. Okay, great. Perfect. Thank you for mansplaining. Gotta bring you back on. Always a pleasure.

If you call him Count Dracula, okay—they're gonna start saying that we should be banned from X. This is how they are. They need censorship to protect their feelings. You better be very careful, RN Explorer. Keyboard Warrior writes: thank you, Candace (Candace Owens) and George, for opening my eyes to Catholicism. For years, I was a lukewarm Christian, and I was agnostic. I became curious of George's story, and I binged his interviews. My eyes are now open. I attend Mass, and I pray the rosary. OCIA is next. Congratulations. I think it used to be called RCIA. That is the program that you have to go through now. It's OCIA. I am hearing—and yeah—I'm very excited to hear that and also even more excited to know that we contributed to that journey—especially George, who rarely does interviews. But I always can book him at the end of the year. You guys know that I can book George at least once a year, and we're coming towards the end of the year. ^t-00-57-17

Candace (Candace Owens) Jackson writes: just showing love and support for you, Candace (Candace Owens). God bless you in the work that you are doing. You are an amazing friend, an incredible truth teller and a researcher—and Brigitte is a man. Careful, or she'll sue you—not because you said she was a man, but because you said something else that she didn't like, and the media will pretend that it's been debunked. It's never debunked, guys. These are psychological operations. And the media is behind them. The media is supporting these operations, rather. I think the military is behind these operations. And I think the military—the cult of military—has wrapped its way around the world as best that I can see it through the books that I am reading. And my eyes have been opened to the fact that these people and these characters are not organic. ^t-00-57-53

They are not working harder than you. They are just more corrupt than you. That's what I've learned. Truly—they kind of put out these stats: Oh, this is why we're so successful. It's a higher IQ. It's just like killing people. You're taking over their companies. You're hostile. You're stealing tech. You're mass murdering people and stealing their land. That's why you're ahead. You're more corrupt. You're more evil. And so, yeah—we need to be radical in our commitment to the truth because you can see how much the truth impacts them. They're completely coming undone—particularly speaking about Zionists right there. Zamit writes: "Candace (Candace Owens), a tipping point in the USA." ^t-00-58-38

And by the way, regarding Turning Point, I can't think of a worse executive decision that could be made than to ban Tucker (Tucker Carlson) from future events. Like literally people are going to perceive that as ignoring Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s dying wish—dying fight, if you will. The last—like I said—thing that we can read in his text messages. So it's just completely absurd and crazy. But look—it's going to be tough for Erika. It's got to be tough for Erika in this moment because she's going to be feeling that pressure in the same way that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was getting that pressure from these top Jewish donors. It's now being transferred. ^t-00-59-20

The if-you-don't-do-this-then-that. This is what they do: financial threats. Zionists love financial threats. They love to force you out of the market and then to pretend that their success is organic—and it never is. They're not interesting at all, actually. If this was a fair world, they would be probably at the bottom of society if they weren't evil. Jonathan Werner writes: "Hey Candace (Candace Owens), I love you, and I am inspired by you to spread the truth no matter what the consequences. Thank you. These evil people are simply abysmal. My Assault on Truth book is coming in next week after months of waiting—time for the world to wake up. ^t-00-59-56

That book is—you will know. What design this movement is once you read that book. It will—no way to unsee it once you see what their strategy is and why they think they had perfected these psychological operations—gaslighting us when we all see Charlie (Charlie Kirk) get shot and then trying to eulogize him. That book is potent. So enjoy and learn about the author—learn about what he went through to tell the truth about the fact that Sigmund Freud was factually defending his pedophile friends. And they brought that to the shores of America. They brought modern psychology to the shores of America and into Hollywood. And the good news is we're all waking up to it. ^t-01-00-41

And like I said, I always want to remind you that the frequency of truth carries more power than a lie. And that's why they demand we shut up. That's why they demand cancellation. They demand that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is not given a platform because he's telling the truth, and it's resonating with people. And he's giving people the courage—more people the courage—to tell the truth, right? They don't want Dave Smith platformed at Turning Point USA. Josh Hammer was angry after he got destroyed by Dave Smith on Turning Point USA stage. So he privately started the struggle session because he knew that when they were on stage—these students that were there—were impacted, and they wanted to follow Dave Smith. People know truth when they hear it, and they know lies when they see it. ^t-01-01-25
