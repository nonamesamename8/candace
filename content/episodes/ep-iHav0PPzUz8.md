Happy Thursday, and some breaking news for you, because I knew it. I knew it. I didn't know it, but I knew it. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I know it. Oh, there were<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-egyptian-air-force-plane-subtt-departs-provo-utah-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-egyptian-air-force-plane-subtt-departs-provo-utah.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-04-egyptian-air-force-plane-subtt-arrives-in-provo-ut-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-04-egyptian-air-force-plane-subtt-arrives-in-provo-ut.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> some <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> military men that were on the ground on <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span><a href="/events/event-2025-08-05-hamptons-summit-pressures-charlie-kirk-on-israel-v.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a> in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>, on the<span id="event-event-2025-08-05-hamptons-summit-pressures-charlie-kirk-on-israel-v-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-05-hamptons-summit-pressures-charlie-kirk-on-israel-v.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> day of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination. And we now need to demand that they publicly release details of who those individuals were and why they were there. This is huge. Okay. In other news, <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> are going crazy like they are every day. They really do not want us investigating <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s murder for some unknown reason. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-00-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=41" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** They want us to stop noticing that there are so many issues in the story that they're trying to sell us. And now they're up in arms demanding that <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> gets canceled from all future <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> conferences. And you're never going to guess how they're trying to spin this. Well, you probably will guess. It's anti-Semitism. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. All right, so while I was away in <span id="ent-gpe-wyoming-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a></span>, I received a rather shocking tip. ^t-00-00-41

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-01-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=82" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** There were, as I am sure you are aware, some inexplicable flights that were happening that day. And actually, they're not even inexplicable. They could very easily be explained. It's just that the feds are kind of declining to do so. And we don't really have much information about those flights. In particular, there was one flight that had a—I would say—described as an interesting morning. It was contracted by our military for whatever reason. This plane departed from the Biggs Army Airfield at 6:13 a.m. That's down in <span id="ent-gpe-el-paso-t-00-01-22"><a href="/entities/gpe-el-paso.md">El Paso</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-texas-t-00-01-22"><a href="/entities/gpe-texas.md">Texas</a></span>, right? And despite the fact that they were heading to <span id="ent-gpe-montana-t-00-01-22"><a href="/entities/gpe-montana.md">Montana</a></span>,<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-private-plane-n888kg-departs-provo-airport-for-pag-t-00-01-22"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-private-plane-n888kg-departs-provo-airport-for-pag.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-10-military-contracted-plane-dips-low-over-provo-airp-t-00-01-22"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-military-contracted-plane-dips-low-over-provo-airp.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> they decided to make an unusual dip at 9:16 a.m. Again, this is in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-01-22"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> time. ^t-00-01-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-02-07.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:07</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=127" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, we're doing all this in mountain time. They dipped down to just 300 feet above ground over the <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-02-07"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> airport runway, and they made a loop. I'm going to show you a screenshot here. This is from <span id="ent-org-flightradar-t-00-02-07"><a href="/entities/org-flightradar.md">FlightRadar</a></span>. So you can see that loop. And again, this is a military plane, a military-contracted plane. And we know it's military because it's leaving from a military base. Okay. Really interesting thing happening there. Mark, if you want to jump on right now, just to describe this for all the women that are listening to this podcast—what we're seeing here with that chart on the bottom. Happy to provide some mansplaining. So at the bottom, you can see the altitude and the airspeed of the plane. ^t-00-02-07

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-02-48.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:48</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=168" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** You see it take off, goes to level flight, and then you see it dip down in the middle there. And that's what we're looking at. The time on there says 3:16 p.m., but that's UTC. That's just the general time for airplanes. So you go back minus six hours to give you <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-02-48"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> time. So that gives us 9:16 a.m. And then it goes back up and then continues to <span id="ent-gpe-montana-t-00-02-48"><a href="/entities/gpe-montana.md">Montana</a></span>. Okay, so it continued on to Kalispell, <a href="/entities/gpe-montana.md">Montana</a>, and then it lands for just under an hour before it again departs back for <span id="ent-gpe-texas-t-00-02-48"><a href="/entities/gpe-texas.md">Texas</a></span> once again on its return trip. It dips again to just over 300 feet over the <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-02-48"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> Airport runway. We're going to show you that again. ^t-00-02-48

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-03-31.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:31</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=211" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** This is from <span id="ent-org-flightradar-t-00-03-31"><a href="/entities/org-flightradar.md">FlightRadar</a></span>—that dip. I should tell you, because there has been a lot of speculation about it online, that took place approximately 26 minutes after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-31"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was assassinated. So that dip took place 26 minutes after. And then the plane went back home or back to the home base in <span id="ent-gpe-el-paso-t-00-03-31"><a href="/entities/gpe-el-paso.md">El Paso</a></span>. Now, it's possible—just to be fair here—that the plane was running a military training exercise that morning. Maybe they were training a new pilot on how to make a fake landing or something. I really don't know. But this flight path did indeed happen. We can confirm that. ^t-00-03-31

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-04-12.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:12</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=252" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And it has been accurately reported that the plane is owned by a certain LSAI LLC—L-A-S-A-I L-L-C—regarding which there haven't been any more details provided because this has not exactly been the most transparent administration, as they claim they were going to be. The second mysterious flight, which was well reported on at the time—I would say this was the most reported-upon flight again by the public and which eventually created so much pressure that it warranted a response from one of the owners of the plane, who was <span id="ent-person-derek-maxfield-t-00-04-12"><a href="/entities/person-derek-maxfield.md">Derek Maxfield</a></span>. He's married to <span id="ent-person-shalane-maxfield-t-00-04-12"><a href="/entities/person-shalane-maxfield.md">Shalane Maxfield</a></span>. The two of them—they're a billionaire couple from <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-04-12"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>. They run<span id="event-event-2025-09-11-derek-maxfield-issues-statement-denying-n888kg-inv-t-00-04-12"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-derek-maxfield-issues-statement-denying-n888kg-inv.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>—now they run—a human sex trafficking<a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-derek-maxfield-issues-statement-denying-n888kg-inv.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a> charity. ^t-00-04-12

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-04-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=295" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** There's a lot of human sex trafficking charities in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-04-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>. And I should let you guys know that they are not the only owners of that plane, by the way. Someone who didn't hit internet radar who also co-owns that plane with them is a person named <span id="ent-person-casey-baugh-t-00-04-55"><a href="/entities/person-casey-baugh.md">Casey Baugh</a></span>—B-A-U-G-H. Now, I'm mentioning <a href="/entities/person-casey-baugh.md">Casey Baugh</a> because I found it—when I was researching—interesting that <a href="/entities/person-casey-baugh.md">Casey Baugh</a> has his name on an institute at <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-04-55"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span>, the Baugh Entrepreneurship Institute, which operates out of the Woodbury Business Building. Okay, I was like, whoa. When we didn't know any details, I was thinking like, hey, did this person let somebody onto the rooftop? But of course now we know that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-04-55"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> was not on the Woodbury Building or ^t-00-04-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-05-40.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:40</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=340" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** on campus at all for that matter. So <span id="ent-person-casey-baugh-t-00-05-40"><a href="/entities/person-casey-baugh.md">Casey Baugh</a></span> is not a suspect for having provided him access in any way. But I will say that the Baugh-Maxfield plane—I'm gonna take you through what that was doing. It caught a ton of attention because the plane departed from <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-05-40"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-05-40"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> at 1:20 p.m. local time. In theory then, of course, yes, a person could have shot <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-40"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, went straight to the airport, and then took off on a private plane. And why this got even more attention was because they seemingly turned their transponder off. That alarmed the public. Why is this plane terminating their transponder? Why don't we know—why can't we see more data happening on this plane, right? Being collected from this plane. ^t-00-05-40

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-06-25.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:25</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=385" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So obviously this couple, Derek and <span id="ent-person-shalane-maxfield-t-00-06-25"><a href="/entities/person-shalane-maxfield.md">Shalane Maxfield</a></span>, were feeling the heat, And they said that contrary to a lot of the online conspiracies that were taking shape, the plane was actually empty when it departed <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-06-25"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> en route to <span id="ent-gpe-arizona-t-00-06-25"><a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a></span>, where he and some of his friends were picked up, and they were turned home to <a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a>. Okay. Some people thought, did they pick up like <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-06-25"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> people? And return back. We don't know at all actually who was on that flight manifest. In theory, it's not really our business, but of course, given this high-profile assassination, it feels like everything should be our business. ^t-00-06-25

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-07-05.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:05</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=425" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Anyways, here's what he said specifically. I'm going to read his statement in its entirety, for good measure. He wrote, "Shalane and I join our community, our state, and our nation in mourning the death of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, and we pray for his family and loved ones during this difficult and tragic time. His death and the way that it occurred was both horrifying and senseless. We pray that the extensive efforts by law enforcement to locate Mr. Kirk's killer will be swift and successful." Spoiler alert: no, it has not been. "As often happens, unfortunately, in the wake of such terrifying and public events, a variety of baseless theories and suspicions around Mr. Kirk's murder immediately took hold on social media, including one that has unfairly impacted our family. To set the record straight, we provide the following facts. ^t-00-07-05

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-07-47.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:47</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=467" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Yesterday at 1 p.m. Mountain Time, a private aircraft owned by one of our companies with the tail number <span id="ent-work-n888kg-t-00-07-47"><a href="/entities/work-n888kg.md">N888KG</a></span> departed the <span id="ent-gpe-provo-t-00-07-47"><a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a></span> Airport for Page, <span id="ent-gpe-arizona-t-00-07-47"><a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a></span>. Pursuant to a pre-scheduled flight plan, occupants at takeoff included two pilots and no passengers. That tail number arrived at Page, <a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a> airport at approximately 1 p.m. Mountain Time. At 12:55 p.m. local time upon arrival, I, <span id="ent-person-derek-maxfield-t-00-07-47"><a href="/entities/person-derek-maxfield.md">Derek Maxfield</a></span>, boarded that plane along with seven additional passengers for the return trip to <a href="/entities/gpe-provo.md">Provo</a>. We departed at PGA Airport in <a href="/entities/gpe-arizona.md">Arizona</a> at approximately 1:40 and arrived at PVU at approximately 3:15 p.m. Mountain Time. ^t-00-07-47

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-08-29.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:29</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=509" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Radar services with air traffic control were terminated in mutual agreement between Denver FAA Center and <span id="ent-work-n888kg-t-00-08-29"><a href="/entities/work-n888kg.md">N888KG</a></span> approximately 10 miles from landing at PGA, which is consistent with generally accepted standard practice when flying in and out of non-towered airports like PGA. <a href="/entities/work-n888kg.md">N888KG</a> pilots followed all FAA requirements and protocols, tower directions, and the predetermined flight plan. This round trip was made at my request and solely for my purposes. Any suggestion that the flights by <a href="/entities/work-n888kg.md">N888KG</a> yesterday are in any way connected to the tragic shooting of Mr. Kirk is inaccurate, false, and without any credible basis of any kind. ^t-00-08-29

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-09-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=553" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** To our knowledge, no one associated with yesterday's flight by <span id="ent-work-n888kg-t-00-09-13"><a href="/entities/work-n888kg.md">N888KG</a></span> has been contacted by law enforcement for any reason." And then they just say, "We ask that you still—you just focus on bringing the people—bring <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-13"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> to justice, the murder of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, finding some justice in that," okay. So a couple of interesting things. He admits that—like something like—the services were terminated, but in compliance with law. So they didn't break the law when they did that at all. And what I can tell you is that I had a flurry of pilots that were working on getting details on that flight manifest, confirming its landing, et cetera. And things got a little bit weird. ^t-00-09-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-09-53.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:53</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=593" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** They were saying that it was unusual that stuff that was pretty standard protocol—the feds seem to be guarding. Very strange. Now I'm not saying this to implicate <span id="ent-person-derek-maxfield-t-00-09-53"><a href="/entities/person-derek-maxfield.md">Derek Maxfield</a></span> or <span id="ent-person-shalane-maxfield-t-00-09-53"><a href="/entities/person-shalane-maxfield.md">Shalane Maxfield</a></span> at all. In fact, that's why I wanted to read their statement in its entirety. But I am telling you that the feds were guarding this just like they were guarding the Dairy Queen. It was weird. Even airport personnel had been instructed to lie, actually. Situation was therefore not routine. And if you haven't caught on, I'm not really here for all of these extraordinary anomalies that just keep happening, right? Information is power. We want the information so we can dispel the rumor. I don't see any reason, by the way, Derek and Shalane—if you want to reach out to me and tell me personally who was on the manifest and I can just say— ^t-00-09-53

I would be glad to dispel all the rumors and innuendo. If the feds are telling the airport to lie for some reason—there was one person who said they were supposed to land at Million Air FBO, but then suddenly they shifted to another FBO and things were weird. I would be happy to clear up everything for you in a way that makes sense. And it could genuinely be because the government is so inefficient. Major point that I wanna make here is that the biggest anomaly that has happened is this kind of foreign angle. Like right away, they just got out in front of it and were like, there's nothing to see here. And we discovered—and I broke the story—that there was actually a third plane, which I found to be quite odd. ^t-00-10-36

They issued what I describe as a false debunking regarding the point that I was making. What they do in terms like that is when you say something that's really big, they focus on something really small and inconsequential—like an error that you made— and I did make in terms of time zones—and they go, oh, well, this has been debunked, right? It's been completely debunked. You saw this in the <span id="ent-person-brigitte-macron-t-00-11-19"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-macron.md">Brigitte</a></span> case. ^t-00-11-19

And of course, it's in the <span id="ent-gpe-middle-east-t-00-23-06"><a href="/entities/gpe-middle-east.md">Middle East</a></span>.

I've watched so many people who I'm close to be vilified for standing up for the truth. I, of course, have dealt with that myself, but I have also seen something else, which is a lot of courage right now in this moment. I don't play defense anymore. I don't water down what I believe to be palatable because silence, I have learned, is not kindness. It's actually consent.

That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love. For just $28—that is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion. $28 will help her see the life that's growing inside of her. It gives her the truth that our culture does not provide. So don't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. We should be unapologetically pro-life.

Give $28. You can also give 10 times that amount if you can. This is the line that I think that we must stand on. We have to stand for truth and what's right. We need to save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel. Again, that is <a href="/entities/org-preborn.md">preborn</a>.org/<a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> to provide an ultrasound for just $28. ^t-00-24-33

After everything that we've been through over the past five years, the number of people that are getting that flu shot is at a record low. Not to mention the fact that even according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective—whatever that means—at best. And that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is, of course, a much better way to stay healthy. So grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from <a href="/entities/org-the-wellness-company.md">The Wellness Company</a>. You wake up with a sore throat or you have a runny nose—you can address those symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit that contains ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, generic Tamiflu, a generic Z-Pak, and so much more.

It's all over the <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-36-18"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> issue, man. And the reason why they got so much support behind them is because they were against this destruction of <span id="ent-gpe-gaza-t-00-36-18"><a href="/entities/gpe-gaza.md">Gaza</a></span>—which was just like the most just horrible, inexcusable, inexcusable thing ever.

And I took the obvious answer, which was to slay a Goliath, right? To slay the Goliath. And somebody wrote me this email and reminded me, of course, of the narrative beyond David slaying the Goliath: David and his unique friendship with Jonathan in the Bible. And I am going to read that email to you. Somebody wrote: "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-42-46"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, David and Jonathan were biblical figures from the Bible who shared a deep and profound friendship—forming a covenant of mutual support. Jonathan was the son of King Saul, and David was a shepherd who became a great warrior and future king. ^t-00-42-46

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-iHav0PPzUz8/t-00-43-28.md" class="timestamp-link">00:43:28</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHav0PPzUz8&t=2608" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Their bond was strong despite the fact that Saul became jealous of David's success—leading him to threaten David. Their bond—the friendship—began after David defeated Goliath and grew into an unlikely but profound friendship. The Bible describes Jonathan's loving David as quote, his own soul and forming a covenant with him. Jonathan's loyalty was so great that he gave David his robe, his armor, and other symbols of rank—an act that has been interpreted as a transfer of <span id="ent-work-succession-t-00-43-28"><a href="/entities/work-succession.md">succession</a></span>. Jonathan repeatedly protected David from his father, Saul—warning him of the king's intentions to kill him. After Jonathan's death, David grieved deeply for his friend. ^t-00-43-28

I love that. I actually love that interpretation that I didn't even consider in that moment when I answered that question. And I just love it. I just wanted to say thank you to the person who wrote the email. And then you consider that it really is about honoring your friend and properly grieving for your friend and realizing that you will not be able to be perceived as someone who even cared about the individual if you don't fight for them—if you don't stand up for them— if you don't look after their legacy, take care of their legacy—don't allow these people like the Josh Hammers and the Seth Dillons to try to invade and quite literally turn <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-44-13"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> into someone he is not—not for a single second. ^t-00-44-13

It is so beyond the realm of possibility that it is sickening to watch them do this. It really shows you—for those of you that are in my <span id="ent-org-club-candace-t-00-44-47"><a href="/entities/org-club-candace.md">book club</a></span>—what I was talking about when we read that last book about how they do this after death. They fight for the person's legacy—even though they were the very same people who were harassing them: the very same people that were making <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> ill with the threats, with the money—who were pressing him at the <span id="ent-gpe-hamptons-t-00-44-47"><a href="/entities/gpe-hamptons.md">Hamptons</a></span>. <span id="ent-person-seth-dillon-t-00-44-47"><a href="/entities/person-seth-dillon.md">Seth Dillon</a></span>, <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-44-47"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span> on the text—hearing what he was going through, seeing what he was going through—will then say, oh, I proclaim myself in charge of that person's legacy. ^t-00-44-47

It's light, it absorbs quickly, and does not leave you with that greasy feeling. They've combined the tallow with a soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil.
