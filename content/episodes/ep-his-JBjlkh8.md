It's happening. Everybody stay calm. After yesterday's episode, where we went kind of for the jugular with Turning Point USA, because really I think everybody in the entire world has had enough with the non-response, trying to move on, trying to gaslight us on answering basic details. So we just went for it. And guess what, Turning Point has moved to formally respond to all the things that we have said. And after a very long diatribe in which they wildly misrepresent the public and global investigation of Charlie Kirk's assassination, they at long last issued a public invitation or a challenge. I'm not sure what it is, but I accept, okay? ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(44); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-00-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Quite literally, all we have ever asked for were sensible answers to our basic questions about what transpired on September 10th. And it looks like we're going to get those things. So major, major win. I am excited. Also, later on in the show, what I have for you is The Game, whose rapper is releasing a song that is entitled, The Assassination of Candace Owens. And I have more questions. I've got questions. Am I allowed to have questions? Welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(91); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:01:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-01-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** What can I say, other than we went max pause, reflect. I'm proud of everybody. I'm proud of the world, every single person who was in my inbox giving me tips, the people inside of Turning Point USA who were leaking, the donors that wrote public letters, or donors that didn't write public letters but sent us messages encouraging us to keep going. Today feels like a win, because guess what? It forced Turning Point USA to finally respond, and that was the entire point, okay? That has been the point of refusing to let up even one second in this investigation. They wanted to simply be able to eulogize Charlie Kirk at a big memorial event, and then they wanted us to simply move on, and we didn't do that. ^t-00-01-31

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(134); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:02:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-02-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, so yeah, we should celebrate the fact that we kept up the pressure, that we insisted that we have answers, that even in this tremendous culture of ADHD and everyone's constantly being distracted by their iPhones, that we kept the focus, okay? Turning Point is going to commit to a live streamed event where they are apparently going to answer all of these lingering questions. And I would say these were pretty basic questions right out of the gates. Why they didn't do that right out of the gates, nobody knows. We can hear their explanation for why they didn't in just a moment, because they sent Blake Neff out. Blake Neff, by the way, is the producer of The Charlie Kirk Show. ^t-00-02-14

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(178); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:02:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-02-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now he is kind of the rotating talent of The Charlie Kirk Show. He was already featured with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on the show, so that's not unusual. But I think we probably anticipated that Andrew Colvett, who is the TPUSA spokesperson, would have been the person to deliver this message. Maybe, in theory, that should have been his job. Maybe he's traveling. The point is we got Blake Neff, and I want to say, just to reiterate, that I have always maintained that whatever is going on at Turning Point USA, I have not felt that Blake Neff is one of the bad guys, okay? I just have never gotten that particular vibe from him. I believe that when he speaks, he believes that he is telling the truth. And maybe that's why they want him in front of the camera. He's been the only person that has been responding in a way that feels even remotely authentic. ^t-00-02-58

Anyways, let's listen to what Blake Neff had to say in its entirety. [Clip now attributed to Blake Neff.] ^t-00-03-40

This has probably been reviewed 12 times by many different lawyers, because that's how it works at big organizations and companies. But I don't fault him that. I will pause at certain moments, because I do want to be able to respond throughout it. It's a bit long, but I want to give them my platform, as I always have made that offer to. So here is Blake Neff. ^t-00-03-53

She's made them against some of Charlie's closest friends and against some of his most dedicated employees. ^t-00-04-17

She has suggested Michael is not his real name. It is. I have seen his birth certificate myself. She has called it suspicious that Mikey's wife, who works at Turning Point, helped plan the campus tour event where Charlie was murdered, which she didn't, by the way. She doesn't work on campus events. ^t-00-04-35

I said it was suspicious that Mikey McCoy's wife, that we never found out who did plan the event. That was one of the answers that we wanted to know. And I said that she works in events. Still was not clear on what happened regarding Mikey McCoy. I think the entire world believes that his actions are suspicious, because we have eyes. And you don't get to wiggle out of that by pretending that us playing the words of his own father, Rob McCoy, who I think is highly suspicious in all of this, he has a suspicious background. ^t-00-05-03

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(336); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:05:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-05-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We played his own words as he tried to sanitize someone who spent time in prison for being a sexual deviant, right, for trying to take photos of young girls. I don't think he's a good guy, and you're not gonna make us forget those things because you are trying to pretend that Mikey's actions were totally normal that day. They weren't. That's why I didn't make the public feel that way, okay? I may have voiced how they felt, which everyone else is refusing to do, but I do believe that Mikey McCoy should have to answer for... who he had on the phone right when the shot went off. ^t-00-05-36

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(375); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:06:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-06-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So yeah, his father, his own father, is the one that spoke about Charlie's notebooks and spoke about how Mikey McCoy was talented. And it was Mikey McCoy who then jumped on Liberty University's stage for an event that was scheduled for Charlie Kirk. So there you go. That's our perspective. And I'm going to stand by it. Let's keep it rolling. ^t-00-06-15

That's a fact. And you can quote me on that because I worked for Turning Point USA, and I went on every tour, every tour since 2019. And typically those events are decided at least the semester before. This came together very quickly. It is unusual. And I don't know why you think that you are going to be able to disprove that notion when I have the emails to support that claim. Let's keep it rolling. ^t-00-06-47

So that doesn't actually make any sense. And this is why it's not good to have lawyers write things out, because sometimes they're not so detail oriented. What we did was we showed at first that when I plotted these strange Egyptian jets, that they were following Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And that was a concern because I wondered if they were tracking Charlie. We then obviously realized that they were tracking TPUSA Faith events and that many more times they were following and perhaps tracking Erica. You should be concerned about that. ^t-00-07-24

Let's keep rolling. ^t-00-08-02

She has raised suspicions about the head of our technical team because he took an SD card out of a camera. She has spread absurd claims that Tyler Boyer, who we just had on the show, sexually abuses male interns. Okay, so yes, the SD card thing is unbelievably suspicious. It's not something that you would do. Neither would you just run up onto a grassy knoll and record yourself. ^t-00-09-04

**<a href="#" onclick="seekTo(583); return false;" class="timestamp-link">00:09:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-09-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Again, these are unusual actions, and rather than trying to pretend like it's normal to record a selfie video of yourself and to prematurely announce that somebody is dead, maybe you should answer why all of that took place, because you guys told lies about, verifiable lies about why that took place. Because don't forget, Andrew Colvett sat next to you and said it was because people were stealing. If people were stealing, you probably would want to grab the very expensive cameras and not the SD card for an event that was being live streamed. Regarding Tyler Boyer, I'm so glad we're going to do this live streamed, because I'm happy to present to you the exact name ^t-00-09-43

And I didn't say that he abused him, I didn't say it was not consensual. I said that he likes younger boys. I don't mean like younger as in they're not of the legal age, I'm just saying they're a lot younger than him. And yeah, I can give you the exact name of the intern that he hooked up with. That person was not at Turning Point USA. But I can also give you more than that as well, as people that are currently working for Turning Point USA who said that Tyler Boyer, and these are young men, tried to hook up with them after some events. So I'm glad we're going to live stream that. Keep going. ^t-00-10-22

I think there's a lot of evidence for that. And I'm happy to discuss that in a broader debate. I do think that things at Turning Point USA became a bit problematic when you started to, I would say, almost hijack genuine Christian faith and sort of roll it into this idea that you must support Israel in order to be a Christian. That's kind of floating into more opinion, but I think well backed by the facts of the founding of the Calvary Chapel Church during ^t-00-11-15

People at Turning Point USA are in possession of text messages the day before Charlie died, in which he wrote out to you, and not just to people that work at Turning Point USA, but also security guards, that he thought that they were going to kill him tomorrow, explicitly. I find it highly unusual that you wouldn't share that information at all, or that you would sit by and be quiet, or at some points attack people that are trying to explore who "they" is, because I don't think anybody believes that Charlie thought ^t-00-12-21

And your silence during moments when people are lying, like Josh Hammer, when he said, "Hey, this never happened, Charlie never blinked on Israel," makes you all look very, very suspicious. Lies are only necessary when you are covering something. And if you are covering the truth, you are betraying Charlie. So I stand by that. Let's keep going. ^t-00-13-03

When he says the quote, it's actually not a full quotation. I never said that, obviously, in the context that he put it in, that Charlie's friends, quote, had to know he was going to be murdered. Did I say the sentence "had to know he was going to be murdered"? Perhaps, but we're going to need to hear the full sentence, because you're trying to context it in a way that is just untrue, and I don't think it's necessary. If you're willing to have a conversation, then you needn't lie about anything that I've said. People have watched the show, they know exactly what I've said, and I tend to stand by what I've said, and I do stand by everything that I've said. Keep going. ^t-00-13-48

Charlie made sure the organization was audited by a third party every year. He personally reviewed, and he signed off on every expense report and literally every single bill paid by the organization, down to a single United States dollar.

There's definitely financial impropriety at the company. I would say that if you are representing yourself as a charity and what you're actually doing is evaporating millions of dollars into various LLCs that have your name on it, that would be financial impropriety. Like, you could say I'm a contractor on this LLC and that LLC, I'm not doing anything illegal, but it's inappropriate, it's improper. Most people are not able to read those forms and won't understand what's happening to the $80 million. ^t-00-14-53

I am struck by the fact that you're still trying to conflate an annual audit with Charlie's explicit request to put together a Doge department seven days before he died. These are not the same. You know they're not the same. I know they're not the same. Okay, everyone knows that Doge is not the same as the audits that are required for 501(c)(3)s conducting an internal audit, and having you still misrepresent that makes us uncomfortable. Address the Doge. That's got nothing to do with anything other than Charlie, right? ^t-00-15-32

That passes the vibe check in terms of what Doge is about, because of course Charlie could not have been establishing Doge for the last five years, because that's a very new concept as of 2025, something that Trump (Donald Trump) put into place with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, right? So, yeah, you're still being dishonest, but carry on. ^t-00-16-14

And by the way, it would probably feel better to the public if you guys were the ones that were asking questions about who was there on that day. I completely stand by what I said about the people that are wearing maroon shirts. They are going to, I will guarantee you, represent a military unit somewhere.

Carry on. "The attacks and allegations from Candace are either lies, or they are innuendos thrown around with a total reckless disregard for the truth so that Candace can manipulate and string along an audience of people who don't realize they are being played. Instead of being able to grieve properly after one of the most heinous murders in American history, a murder many of us had to witness, my friends have had to endure harassment from people who have gotten whipped up by what Candace is saying. In fact, I would say we have suffered more harassment from these people than we have from Antifa supporters who overtly celebrate Charlie's murder. ^t-00-18-47

Okay, conflating people that are trying to figure out who murdered Charlie Kirk with, like, Antifa is actually objectively funny. That's an unforced error. They should not have included that in the statement. Somebody in that room was like, should we say that? Should we not? And somebody said, no, we shouldn't say that. And then somebody else in the room said, no, we should. Let's keep it in. That second person was wrong. That should have been struck from the statement. It's very silly. Okay.

And to pretend like you are too aggrieved to be able to answer the questions makes entirely no sense. Obviously, if you were actually under a real amount of stress, if you actually were deeply upset that people had you on a list of suspects or thought that you were suspicious, you would just clarify things instantly, immediately.

First, first, we thought that her prevarications were so absurd that nobody would believe them. We shouldn't have to answer questions about secret tunnels or Egyptian Air Force planes. That sort of thing is just beneath contempt to respond to. The second reason we've said so little, though, is because there's a good rule of thumb, which Charlie followed. Do not feed the trolls.

It is beneath us to respond to the very people who showed up in scores because they were so moved by Charlie's assassination that they all poured into the Staples Center, right, and poured their tears out and made videos and donated. It is beneath us to not... to then respond to questions that you have that are meaningful, because we just think it's so stupid that you would suggest that the feds are involved in an assassination.

For the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. And they only use the top 1 or 2% of the entire Angus population as their breeding stock, producing beef that has much more flavor and tenderness than your average Angus beef. Now, each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. All Riverbend Ranch cattle were born and raised here in the USA. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. And the beef is processed right at their ranch in their award-winning USDA-inspected processing facility. So you avoid the costly middlemen because the beef is sent directly from their ranch to your home. ^t-00-35-06

And some of them are, okay. James O'Keefe, obviously formerly of Project Veritas, he's very much trusted. Matt Gaetz, I like him very much. But some of the people that they let in are almost the exact opposite of trustworthy and are just radically pro-Zionist. Like, they will lie, steal, cheat, and figuratively murder, or I guess literally allow Israel to murder, without asking any questions. And so that's why they're being let in, most notably, obviously, Laura Loomer. She's totally nutty. ^t-00-37-59

I mean, like she has psychotic issues. Allowing Laura Loomer into a national defense complex is actually sort of just an indication of just how committed they are to laundering the reputations of anyone as long as they say, "I support Israel," because Laura Loomer is quite literally so deranged that she once handcuffed herself to the Twitter headquarters because they banned her account, okay? That's like—and she wore the yellow Star of David. When I met her, she was crying tears because they took away her check mark. She deeply, deeply cares about social media in a way that is just unhinged, okay? ^t-00-38-41

But due to her commitment to Zionism, which in a Zionist defense seems like a psychopathology is a prerequisite, the media is now trying to mainstream her and make us think that she's like a serious person. So our government, the Pentagon, decided to credential her at this time. She's a part of the new press corps that we can trust. Laura has probably been one of the more prominent gaslighters when it comes to Charlie Kirk's assassination. She hated Charlie when he was alive and now wants everyone to honor him by not prodding the narrative surrounding his death. ^t-00-39-20

Charlie believed in free speech and he believed in debate, and so that was her reason for attacking him. Briefly showing you this tweet from her, not even worth reading in its entirety, but this is the tweet that she sent out. And then Charlie died a couple of weeks later, and she completely switched, and now thinks that she's guarding his legacy. ^t-00-40-02

I think that's fair. Here's our new press corps, guys. Take a listen to—actually first, let's focus in on Cam Higby's question. The way he asks it is, I think, worthy of highlighting.

All right, top comment from yesterday's episode. Somebody writes, "The worst part of being awake is realizing there are way more evil people on this planet than I ever thought possible." I actually don't think there's more. I think they have a tremendous amount of power. I think they have control over the military, and I think that power will wane if we stop subjecting ourselves to their systems, their financial systems, their peer pressure systems, Hollywood, you know, the adoration that we had for stars and we followed their trends. And if we actually studied where it all came from, which is incredibly evil indoctrination—quite literally doctrines of evil—which is guiding that movement, ^t-00-57-02

I spoke about it more at length with Russell Brand on his show, so that should be coming out soon, but we have to become educated about where it stems from. There's less of them, but they have a lot of power and they have a lot of influence, and they have, you know, blackmailed people that are in powerful positions. There's definitively more of us. That's why they want to kill us, obviously. That's why they want to drug us and keep us dumb, is because the numbers are not on their side. So we have to make sure it's not just the numbers, but also that the ideology is not on their side. The answer to people that want less families—not because they want you to be more efficient and to climb the corporate ladder, they just want less of you. There needs to be less slaves if you want to maintain control, ^t-00-57-46

That's the true answer, is that that's why they promote all of these things. That's why they want people to have less children, is because they want to increase their numbers while decreasing ours. And so we need to be radical about not also giving our children to the system. If you can—and you can, you absolutely can—homeschool your children, pull them out of the system. Don't send your kids to college. Usury is another one of their tactics. Don't rack up debt. I made that mistake and learned nothing. It's just more time for them to indoctrinate your children. Be bold in changing the system. Be radical in your response of taking ownership over your own home. That's what I would say in response to that. Goodness wins. Goodness wins. In truth, Christ has already won. ^t-00-58-28

Meryl writes, "Careful Candace, they may be betting that you won't be available for a sit down the next few weeks. Also watch your sources, sometimes the feds plant sources with almost good information in order to humiliate their target later." Yes, I'm very aware of that, and we are very cautious about our sources, and sometimes that has happened where—and we haven't gone. Fortunately, we haven't made a public mistake, but we'll keep going. And then I'll be like, I think this is good. And then Mark will be like, I don't know about this, or Skylar, I don't know about this. And that is what takes us so much time every day, is for a small team, but we're constantly having to debate ourselves before we put something out. So thank you for that. Briley writes, "They didn't answer any of your questions. They only brought up speculations that you made throughout the series. ^t-00-59-13

It is so sad that we have reached a time where you guys are legitimately concerned about my safety, and I get that. I get that. I feel like there is definitely something military that happened when Charlie got assassinated, and I think our lack of comfort comes from perhaps their refusal to acknowledge that, I think. Their response is what makes you guys feel fearful. But truly, I don't think Turning Point USA is so silly and stupid that they would coordinate an assassination on their campus and then think they're going to be like, that just happened. It was all weird. She ate a bad sandwich or something. But it is sad. ^t-00-59-56

Angie Lynn writes, "TPUSA will lie about everything as they have been doing. Do not trust this for one second. You and your family's safety, money, everything is compromised. Team Candace Christ is king." James Gray writes, "The TPUSA response seemed fake, calculated, scared. That guy's body language was just completely off and he was literally speaking from a script." Yeah, he's speaking from a script, but I will say the thing that felt genuine was at the very end when he said, "I owe everything to Charlie." That's when he went off script. I don't know that they remember or know how to be authentic like that anymore. They're gonna find out, because I'm very authentic, and us having a face-to-face, I think it's the best way to answer this. ^t-01-00-40

You don't go into an organization and help to build it up because you one day hope that the founder of it is going to be assassinated so that you can destroy it, the very thing that you helped to build in a very big way. I contributed greatly to Turning Point USA's success, and they would never deny that. And so, it's sad. It is really sad to see this sort of elitist direction that they're taking in, "Oh, we thought you guys would be smarter than to listen to her. Oh, you guys are Antifa." What is that? It's such crap. James Gray writes—sorry, I read that one. Tara writes, "Licensed psychotherapist here. ^t-01-01-23

I would gladly put my license on the line at this point to help in even the smallest of ways, holding you and your family in prayer, Candace." Keep up the prayers. Keep up the prayers. Brittany Watson writes, "Candace, you are not just going max. You are going scorched earth. And after watching Monday's episode when you said that you are not some basic B.I., I was like, girl, take my money. Thank you for being the world's best crime-fighting superhero." You know, I always think back to this interview that Kanye gave before I knew who he was. And I always loved Kanye. I loved his music. I loved the code of his music, which is you have to believe in yourself because the whole world is going to tell you you can't. ^t-01-02-05

And people that you thought that you would be allies with, you find to be your enemies. Like, that's kind of the coded message of Kanye's music. But there's this interview that he gives where he says, somebody—I don't know what they asked him—but he responds and he says, "You know, if you're a fan of Kanye West, you're not a fan of Kanye West. You're actually a fan of yourself. You believe in yourself and you think that you can do something in this world." And I feel the same way. I think that the people who think that they're fans of mine, you're not fans of Candace. You believe in yourself. ^t-01-02-45

Like, there's that thing, there's that spark inside of you. It's kind of what I got when Kanye said that. It's not me, it's the spark that you see in me. It's the audacity to be yourself and to think your own thoughts and to keep going when the whole world tells you no. That's how I feel. "Candace go max." I love that someone picked up that name as their username. "Thanks for the honest investigations. The truth shall set us all free. Thanks for the USS Liberty episode as well." To this day, the best interview that we have ever given. We were all—you could feel a ^t-01-03-25

I'll never forget that interview. It transformed me. It was a major turning point in my life. And thank you guys more. I mean, I'm so grateful to you guys, and I hope you know that. I start all of my prayers with gratitude, because I started realizing that sometimes when you pray, you're asking for a lot. But if you start with gratitude of the things that you're thankful for, like, you know, when you come to God and you're like, I would like to—I'm grateful for my health, I'm grateful for this... By the time you get through all the things that you're grateful for, you're like, man, do I really want to lodge any complaints? It's a good way to pray. And I always say that I am grateful for the people around the world that believed in me ^t-01-04-06

So I'm glad that we are at long last going to get them from Turning Point USA, it sounds like. Like I said, I'll do this tomorrow. I don't have to be in person. We can live stream this. I think the people trust me to represent all of the questions that we have. And we can have the money go to Turning Point USA, every dollar that's raised I would gladly sacrifice that to the organization. That's how much it means to just be able to get these questions answered. Anyways, you guys, we will see you tomorrow. ^t-01-04-46
