It's happening. It's happening. Everybody, stay calm. After yesterday's episode, where we went kind of for the jugular with Turning Point USA—because really, I think everybody in the entire world has had enough with the non-response, trying to move on, trying to gaslight us on answering basic details— so we just went for it. And guess what? Turning Point has moved to formally respond to all the things that we have said. And after a very long diatribe in which they wildly misrepresent the public and global investigation of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, they at long last issued a public invitation or a challenge. I'm not sure what it is, but I accept, okay? ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=44" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-00-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Quite literally, all we have ever asked for were sensible answers to our basic questions about what transpired on September 10th. And it looks like we're going to get those things. So major, major win. I am excited. Also, later on in the show, what I have for you is The Game, whose rapper is releasing a song that is entitled "The Assassination of Candace Owens." And I have more questions. I've got questions. Am I allowed to have questions? Welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=91" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-01-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** What can I say other than we went max? Pause, reflect. I'm proud of everybody. I'm proud of the world—every single person who was in my inbox giving me tips, the people inside of Turning Point USA who were leaking, the donors that wrote public letters, or donors that didn't write public letters but sent us messages encouraging us to keep going. Today feels like a win, because guess what? It forced Turning Point USA to finally respond, and that was the entire point, okay? That has been the point of refusing to let up even one second in this investigation. They wanted to simply be able to eulogize Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at a big memorial event, and then they wanted us to simply move on, and we didn't do that. ^t-00-01-31

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=134" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-02-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, so yeah, we should celebrate the fact that we kept up the pressure, that we insisted that we have answers—that even in this tremendous culture of ADHD and everyone's constantly being distracted by their iPhones—that we kept the focus, okay? Turning Point is going to commit to a live-streamed event where they are apparently going to answer all of these lingering questions. And I would say these were pretty basic questions right out of the gates. Why they didn't do that right out of the gates, nobody knows. We can hear their explanation for why they didn't in just a moment, because they sent Blake Neff out. Blake Neff, by the way, is the producer of The Charlie Kirk Show. ^t-00-02-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=178" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-02-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now he is kind of the rotating talent of The Charlie Kirk Show. He was already featured with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on the show, so that's not unusual. But I think we probably anticipated that Andrew Colvett, who is the TPUSA spokesperson, would have been the person to deliver this message. Maybe, in theory, that should have been his job. Maybe he's traveling. The point is we got Blake Neff, and I want to say—just to reiterate—that I have always maintained that whatever is going on at Turning Point USA, I have not felt that Blake Neff is one of the bad guys, okay? I just have never gotten that particular vibe from him. I believe that when he speaks, he believes that he is telling the truth. And maybe that's why they want him in front of the camera. He's been the only person that has been responding in a way that feels even remotely authentic. ^t-00-02-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=220" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-03-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** When he defends the actions of Mikey McCoy on that day, I sense that he believes that he is telling the truth. Anyways, let's listen to what Blake Neff had to say in its entirety. [Clip now attributed to Blake Neff.] It's not going to feel organic. Obviously, he's reading from a piece of paper. This has probably been reviewed 12 times by many different lawyers, because that's how it works at big organizations and companies. But I don't fault him that. I will pause at certain moments, because I do want to be able to respond throughout it. It's a bit long, but I want to give them my platform, as I always have made that offer to. So here is Blake Neff. ^t-00-03-40

She's made them against some of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s closest friends and against some of his most dedicated employees. ^t-00-04-17

She has suggested Michael is not his real name. It is. I have seen his birth certificate myself. She has called it suspicious that Mikey's wife, who works at Turning Point, helped plan the campus tour event where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was murdered, which she didn't, by the way. She doesn't work on campus events. ^t-00-04-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=303" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-05-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, so first and foremost, I actually never said that she helped plan the event. I said it was suspicious that Mikey McCoy's wife—that we never found out who did plan the event. That was one of the answers that we wanted to know. And I said that she works in events. Still was not clear on what happened regarding Mikey McCoy. I think the entire world believes that his actions are suspicious, because we have eyes. And you don't get to wiggle out of that by pretending that us playing the words of his own father, Rob McCoy—who I think is highly suspicious in all of this, he has a suspicious background— ^t-00-05-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=336" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-05-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** we played his own words as he tried to sanitize someone who spent time in prison for being a sexual deviant, right? For trying to take photos of young girls. I don't think he's a good guy, and you're not gonna make us forget those things because you are trying to pretend that Mikey's actions were totally normal that day. They weren't. That's why I didn't make the public feel that way, okay? I may have voiced how they felt—which everyone else is refusing to do—but I do believe that Mikey McCoy should have to answer for who he had on the phone right when the shot went off. ^t-00-05-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=375" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-06-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So yeah, his father—his own father—is the one that spoke about Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s notebooks and spoke about how Mikey McCoy was talented. And it was Mikey McCoy who then jumped on Liberty University's stage for an event that was scheduled for Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So there you go. That's our perspective. And I'm going to stand by it. Let's keep it rolling. ^t-00-06-15

That's a fact. And you can quote me on that because I worked for Turning Point USA, and I went on every tour—every tour since 2019. And typically those events are decided at least the semester before. This came together very quickly. It is unusual. And I don't know why you think that you are going to be able to disprove that notion when I have the emails to support that claim. Let's keep it rolling. ^t-00-06-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=444" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-07-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Definitely never said Turning Point lied, because you never responded. So that doesn't actually make any sense. And this is why it's not good to have lawyers write things out, because sometimes they're not so detail-oriented. What we did was we showed at first that when I plotted these strange Egyptian jets, that they were following Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And that was a concern because I wondered if they were tracking Charlie (Charlie Kirk). We then obviously realized that they were tracking TPUSA Faith events and that many more times they were following and perhaps tracking Erika. You should be concerned about that. ^t-00-07-24

Let's keep rolling. ^t-00-08-02

What I said is another fact. They did not issue him first aid when he fell down. There was nobody who pulled out any gauze and tried to stop the bleeding. And they've admitted to that. In a sit-down with Sean Ryan, Brian Harpole said, "It was because of the severity of the injury." I'm sorry again that we noticed something that stood out as unusual, given the expertise and the amount of money that he was paying that was supposed to be an elite team. She has raised suspicions about the head of our technical team because he took an SD card out of a camera. ^t-00-08-43

It's not something that you would do. Neither would you just run up onto a grassy knoll and record yourself. Again, these are unusual actions, and rather than trying to pretend like it's normal to record a selfie video of yourself and to prematurely announce that somebody is dead, maybe you should answer why all of that took place— because you guys told lies about—verifiable lies about—why that took place. Because don't forget, Andrew Colvett sat next to you and said it was because people were stealing. If people were stealing, you probably would want to grab the very expensive cameras and not the SD card for an event that was being live-streamed. ^t-00-09-34

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=616" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-10-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Regarding Tyler Bowyer, I'm so glad we're going to do this live-streamed, because I'm happy to present to you the exact name of the intern. And I didn't say that he abused him. I didn't say it was not consensual. I said that he likes younger boys. I don't mean like younger as in they're not of the legal age. I'm just saying they're a lot younger than him. And yeah, I can give you the exact name of the intern that he hooked up with. That person was not at Turning Point USA. But I can also give you more than that as well—as people that are currently working for Turning Point USA who said that Tyler Bowyer—and these are young men—tried to hook up with them after some events. So I'm glad we're going to live-stream that. Keep going. ^t-00-10-16

I think there's a lot of evidence for that. And I'm happy to discuss that in a broader debate. I do think that things at Turning Point USA became a bit problematic when you started to—I would say—almost hijack genuine Christian faith and sort of roll it into this idea that you must support Israel in order to be a Christian. That's kind of floating into more opinion, but I think well-backed by the facts of the founding of the Calvary Chapel Church during ^t-00-11-15

People at Turning Point USA are in possession of text messages the day before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, in which he wrote out to you—and not just to people that work at Turning Point USA, but also security guards—that he thought that they were going to kill him tomorrow, explicitly. I find it highly unusual that you wouldn't share that information at all, or that you would sit by and be quiet, or at some points attack people that are trying to explore who "they" is—because I don't think anybody believes that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) thought ^t-00-12-21

And your silence during moments when people are lying—like Josh Hammer, when he said, "Hey, this never happened. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never blinked on Israel"—makes you all look very, very suspicious. Lies are only necessary when you are covering something. And if you are covering the truth, you are betraying Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So I stand by that. Let's keep going. ^t-00-13-03

When he says the quote, it's actually not a full quotation. I never said that, obviously, in the context that he put it in—that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s friends, quote, "had to know he was going to be murdered." Did I say the sentence "had to know he was going to be murdered"? Perhaps, but we're going to need to hear the full sentence, because you're trying to context it in a way that is just untrue, and I don't think it's necessary. If you're willing to have a conversation, then you needn't lie about anything that I've said. People have watched the show. They know exactly what I've said, and I tend to stand by what I've said, and I do stand by everything that I've said. Keep going. ^t-00-13-48

Charlie (Charlie Kirk) made sure the organization was audited by a third party every year. He personally reviewed, and he signed off on, every expense report and literally every single bill paid by the organization, down to a single United States dollar. We have never missed a 990 deadline. Okay, so immorality—like financial impropriety—does not necessarily mean that you committed true financial fraud. ^t-00-14-26

I would say that if you are representing yourself as a charity and what you're actually doing is evaporating millions of dollars into various LLCs that have your name on it, that would be financial impropriety. Like, you could say I'm a contractor on this LLC and that LLC. I'm not doing anything illegal, but it's inappropriate. It's improper. Most people are not able to read those forms and won't understand what's happening to the $80 million. And I think that those questions are of course valid, and that you guys should have no issues answering them. I am struck by the fact that you're still trying to conflate ^t-00-15-03

These are not the same. You know they're not the same. I know they're not the same. Okay, everyone knows that DOGE is not the same as the audits that are required for 501(c)(3)s—conducting an internal audit—and having you still misrepresent that makes us uncomfortable. Address the DOGE. That's got nothing to do with anything other than Charlie (Charlie Kirk), right? Charlie (Charlie Kirk) felt that this needed to happen, and inside sources at your own company say it was because he didn't know where the money was coming from, or how quickly and where exactly the money was being evaporated to. ^t-00-15-43

So, yeah, you're still being dishonest, but carry on. ^t-00-16-26

At one point in early November, she started wildly throwing suspicion on members of Utah Valley's soccer team for wearing hoodies. I could go on. There is always something new coming up, and none of it ever pans out. Because, from the start, there has been nothing there. ^t-00-16-49

Like, you're just like, "It's not weird." No, this is normal. It's totally fine that these Egyptian planes—and also, by the way, today it broke the Saudi king was on this plane at some point, 2023. We'll get to that later. And you guys are like, "This is totally normal." This is just what happens at UVU. People just lay over into Wilmington, do things. It's just so foolish. You guys have got to stop the gaslighting if you think your organization is going to survive. I mean, some of that stuff is just untrue. Saying that I went after somebody for wearing a green hoodie is not true at all. ^t-00-17-22

I shared a picture when somebody asked for a picture, because they were trying to investigate and identify everyone who was there—which is valid. And the person wearing the green hoodie was not even upset about it. He responded. So that has nothing to do with me whatsoever. And by the way, it would probably feel better to the public if you guys were the ones that were asking questions about who was there on that day. I completely stand by what I said about the people that are wearing maroon shirts. They are going to—I will guarantee you—represent a military unit somewhere. I'm very close to figuring out exactly which military unit that was. Again, trying to gaslight us and pretend we're conspiracy theorists or like that's stupid— ^t-00-18-04

Instead of being able to grieve properly after one of the most heinous murders in American history—a murder many of us had to witness—my friends have had to endure harassment from people who have gotten whipped up by what Candace is saying.

That's an unforced error. They should not have included that in the statement. Somebody in that room was like, "Should we say that? Should we not?" And somebody said, "No, we shouldn't say that." And then somebody else in the room said, "No, we should. Let's keep it in." That second person was wrong. That should have been struck from the statement. It's very silly. Okay. It's very silly to attack your own audiences who are concerned, and your own donors who are concerned, and say you're Antifa. If you don't accept this absurd fed slop—if you're not going to drink the fed slop—then you are Antifa. Just not a good idea whatsoever, okay? That is not what's happening here. You are not the victim. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is, actually. He's dead. And to pretend like you are too aggrieved to be able to answer the questions makes entirely no sense. ^t-00-19-49

It's so easy. It's free. If someone said, "Candace, what were you doing when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot?" I'd be like, "I was sitting down at my table, prepping my show." Like, the question doesn't offend me because I had nothing to do with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) dying, okay? This is a psychological technique that is failing. It is failing for you. And you're upset because you thought that with time—with the passage of time—people would let the story go, and they didn't. And these reasons that he's about to list for why they didn't respond to answer any questions are beyond ridiculous. Let's take a listen. ^t-00-20-34

People have wanted us to invite Candace on the show. But for a long time, our approach was to say nothing. We did that for several reasons. First, first, we thought that her prevarications were so absurd that nobody would believe them. We shouldn't have to answer questions about secret tunnels or Egyptian Air Force planes. That sort of thing is just beneath contempt to respond to. The second reason we've said so little, though, is because there's a good rule of thumb, which Charlie (Charlie Kirk) followed. Do not feed the trolls. Focus on the mission. Reviving America, uplifting young people, making heaven crowded. ^t-00-21-20

Like, that's just not the right attitude. I mean, that is an elitist attitude. It is beneath us to respond to the very people who showed up in scores because they were so moved by Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination that they all poured into the Staples Center, right? And poured their tears out and made videos and donated. It is beneath us to not to then respond to questions that you have that are meaningful, because we just think it's so stupid that you would suggest that the feds are involved in an assassination. That's never happened in American history. What? What? So that's a ridiculous thing. The second thing he says there is, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) always said, don't feed the trolls." ^t-00-22-24

So I'm not a troll, okay? I'm not a troll. I'm not trolling. I'm not someone who's hated Turning Point and wanted Turning Point to fail. I'm actually the exact opposite of that. And that's why the people believe in me and they trust me, because they feel that I'm the only one that's acting right in this situation. Who wouldn't want to have every stone unturned if they cared about somebody? Who wouldn't want to have every question answered? Who wouldn't be immediately suspicious to see Egyptian military jets? Who wouldn't go, "Why the hell were these jets around Turning Point way before—years before—Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination?" Who is on these jets? ^t-00-23-08

So many times they're just trying to give the vibe that this is so crazy. No, they are fearful. The Egyptian planes hold the key, and that is obvious even in Blake Neff's statement. But yeah, I am not a troll, okay? And people followed what felt to them as authenticity. And it was not you. They were not getting that from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s closest friends. Why is that? They weren't getting that from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s most loved pastors. Why is that? Don't blame me for the bad energy that you exuded, okay? ^t-00-23-52

That's why you're doing this, okay? That is why you are doing this, because your strategy failed. In fact, this is your old-school Turning Point before they put on the faith pants. This is your old-school Turning Point lesson in what the free markets are. The free markets saw what you were offering, right? And they saw what I was offering. You were offering, "We should accept this and move on," and I was saying we need to investigate this. And the free markets said no to Turning Point USA. ^t-00-24-33

Now, each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. All Riverbend Ranch cattle were born and raised here in the USA. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. And the beef is processed right at their ranch in their award-winning USDA-inspected processing facility. So you avoid the costly middlemen because the beef is sent directly from their ranch to your home. ^t-00-35-06

Also want to tell you guys about the Wellness Company, because what if the sore throat and fever that hit you overnight did not mean that you have to cancel a family trip or miss work or waste hours at urgent care? Instead, you could just open your medical emergency kit from the Wellness Company, match your symptoms to the doctor-recommended guide, and start treatment immediately at home. This is not a first aid kit. It is a mini urgent care center right at your fingertips. Inside, you'll find core prescriptions to treat over 30 conditions like COVID, strep throat, pneumonia, and more. No more waiting rooms or pharmacy lines. ^t-00-35-51

It's a trap." I really—guys, I think that they would kind of figure that they would be blamed for that. I think we're okay there. But let's start with the Pentagon because this is interesting. The United States Pentagon—in case you don't know—is the complex that houses our Department of Defense. It's a massive complex, right? There is arguably no more relevant building to communicating to the American people about foreign threats. That's what they do. It's quite literally the nerve center for the United States Armed Forces. It's headquarters for the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. ^t-00-37-21

And some of them are, okay. James O'Keefe—obviously formerly of Project Veritas—he's very much trusted. Matt Gaetz—I like him very much. But some of the people that they let in are almost the exact opposite of trustworthy and are just radically pro-Zionist. Like, they will lie, steal, cheat, and figuratively murder—or I guess literally allow Israel to murder—without asking any questions. And so that's why they're being let in, most notably, obviously, Laura Loomer. She's totally nutty. ^t-00-37-59

I mean, like she has psychotic issues. Allowing Laura Loomer into a national defense complex is actually sort of just an indication of just how committed they are to laundering the reputations of anyone as long as they say, "I support Israel," because Laura Loomer is quite literally so deranged that she once handcuffed herself to the Twitter headquarters because they banned her account, okay? That's like—and she wore the yellow Star of David. When I met her, she was crying tears because they took away her check mark. She deeply, deeply cares about social media in a way that is just unhinged, okay? ^t-00-38-41

But due to her commitment to Zionism—which in a Zionist defense seems like a psychopathology is a prerequisite—the media is now trying to mainstream her and make us think that she's like a serious person. So our government—the Pentagon—decided to credential her at this time. She's a part of the new press corps that we can trust. Laura has probably been one of the more prominent gaslighters when it comes to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. She hated Charlie (Charlie Kirk) when he was alive and now wants everyone to honor him by not prodding the narrative surrounding his death. ^t-00-39-20

Charlie (Charlie Kirk) believed in free speech and he believed in debate, and so that was her reason for attacking him. Briefly showing you this tweet from her— not even worth reading in its entirety, but this is the tweet that she sent out. And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died a couple of weeks later, and she completely switched, and now thinks that she's guarding his legacy. ^t-00-40-02

Now, I obviously reported that the French Foreign Legion were apparently on the ground on the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. ^t-00-40-39

I think that's fair. Here's our new press corps, guys. Take a listen to—actually first, let's focus in on Cam Higby's question. The way he asks it is, I think, worthy of highlighting.

So when I say to you guys—when I stress to you guys—that you should not be signing up for war, you should not be signing up for the military, you should not get involved in this obvious war that they are planning that's coming soon—this exact moment between these two people is what I'm referring to. It's like a rare glimpse into the elitist perspective of our government.

And so this article is written with such elitism—the hope that the state will step in and just break it, just bankrupt it. This is an actual quotation: "The lawsuit is set to test whether the controversy-as-currency that made Owens rich and gave her a media brand that reaches tens of millions of people can survive what experts say will be an immensely costly legal battle."

I mean, the thing is, she said that people were trying to assassinate her, so all I did was say it to her. You know what I'm saying? So again, the song is not about her, but Candace Owens, man—she real smart. Really intelligent woman. But if she comes for me, I mean, you know, it is what it is, man. It is what it is." ^t-00-52-23

There's beef in these streets, and you better be scared, because maybe I am coming for you, okay? I could be coming for you. I might drop a whole album. I might drop a whole mixtape too, okay? Anyways, I think it is a form of flattery, obviously. I'm friends with Ye, and he makes music, and they do use a lot of metaphors, so I'm not affected by this. Do I love the timing? Could I get a break for six months, maybe, and not have that title be there? Sure, but I'm totally okay with this. I think it's kind of cool. I actually kind of think it's cool. I hope the song lyrics are cool and it's not a diss track and it's not gonna be like Eminem crying about me on a whole album, but I look forward to the song. I hope you use also—feel free to use a little audio from the podcast. That would be cool. ^t-00-52-45

"Everything is fake and gay" would be super, super fly. Everything is fake and gay. Please put that in the song. That's my only request. All right, you guys, we'll get through a couple more sponsors, and I will answer some of your comments. Okay, what if you could delay your next two mortgage payments? That's right. Imagine putting those two payments in your pocket and finally getting a little bit of breathing room ahead of the holidays. Well, that's now possible when you call American Financing. If you're feeling stretched by everyday expenses—groceries, gas bill, it's all piling up— then you are not alone, because most Americans are putting these expenses on credit cards, and credit card rates are insane. They're in the 20s or even the 30s. ^t-00-53-29

Their salary-based mortgage consultants are helping homeowners just like you restructure their loans and save money every month—all without any upfront fees. Their customers are saving an average of $800 a month, and that's essentially like a $10,000 a year raise without having to change jobs. So call American Financing today at 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or simply visit americanfinancing.net/owens—americanfinancing.net/owens. Also, you guys know I have to tell you about Nimmie Skincare. I love them.

And I had a lot of muses for my book, which is finally out: Make Him a Sandwich. You guys can get that on Amazon. People have been asking about international shipping. If you go to MakeHimASandwich.com, we are now shipping to Canada. ^t-00-55-36

All right, top comment from yesterday's episode. Somebody writes, "The worst part of being awake is realizing there are way more evil people on this planet than I ever thought possible." I actually don't think there's more. I think they have a tremendous amount of power. I think they have control over the military, and I think that power will wane if we stop subjecting ourselves to their systems—their financial systems, their peer pressure systems, Hollywood, you know, the adoration that we had for stars and we followed their trends. And if we actually studied where it all came from—which is incredibly evil indoctrination—quite literally doctrines of evil—which is guiding that movement— ^t-00-57-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=3466" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:57:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-57-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** it's guiding that theology rather. I spoke about it more at length with Russell Brand on his show, so that should be coming out soon. But we have to become educated about where it stems from. There's less of them, but they have a lot of power and they have a lot of influence, and they have—you know—blackmailed people that are in powerful positions. There's definitively more of us. That's why they want to kill us, obviously. That's why they want to drug us and keep us dumb, is because the numbers are not on their side. So we have to make sure it's not just the numbers, but also that the ideology is not on their side. The answer to people that want less families—not because they want you to be more efficient and to climb the corporate ladder—they just want less of you. There needs to be less slaves if you want to maintain control, ^t-00-57-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=3508" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:58:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-58-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** and you don't want the risk of a revolution to come down upon you. That's the true answer—is that that's why they promote all of these things. That's why they want people to have less children—is because they want to increase their numbers while decreasing ours. And so we need to be radical about not also giving our children to the system. If you can—and you can, you absolutely can—homeschool your children. Pull them out of the system. Don't send your kids to college. Usury is another one of their tactics. Don't rack up debt. I made that mistake and learned nothing. It's just more time for them to indoctrinate your children. Be bold in changing the system. Be radical in your response of taking ownership over your own home. That's what I would say in response to that. Goodness wins. Goodness wins. In truth, Christ has already won. ^t-00-58-28

Meryl writes, "Careful Candace, they may be betting that you won't be available for a sit-down the next few weeks. Also watch your sources. Sometimes the feds plant sources with almost good information in order to humiliate their target later." Yes, I'm very aware of that, and we are very cautious about our sources, and sometimes that has happened where—and we haven't gone. Fortunately, we haven't made a public mistake, but we'll keep going. And then I'll be like, "I think this is good." And then Mark will be like, "I don't know about this," or Skylar—"I don't know about this." And that is what takes us so much time every day—is for a small team, but we're constantly having to debate ourselves before we put something out. So thank you for that. Briley writes, "They didn't answer any of your questions. They only brought up speculations that you made throughout the series. ^t-00-59-13

It is so sad that we have reached a time where you guys are legitimately concerned about my safety, and I get that. I get that. I feel like there is definitely something military that happened when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got assassinated, and I think our lack of comfort comes from perhaps their refusal to acknowledge that, I think. Their response is what makes you guys feel fearful. But truly, I don't think Turning Point USA is so silly and stupid that they would coordinate an assassination on their campus and then think they're going to be like, "That just happened. It was all weird. She ate a bad sandwich or something." But it is sad. ^t-00-59-56

Angie Lynn writes, "TPUSA will lie about everything as they have been doing. Do not trust this for one second. You and your family's safety, money—everything is compromised. Team Candace. Christ is king." James Gray writes, "The TPUSA response seemed fake, calculated, scared. That guy's body language was just completely off, and he was literally speaking from a script." Yeah, he's speaking from a script, but I will say the thing that felt genuine was at the very end when he said, "I owe everything to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." That's when he went off script. I don't know that they remember or know how to be authentic like that anymore. They're gonna find out, because I'm very authentic, and us having a face-to-face—I think it's the best way to answer this. ^t-01-00-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=3683" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">01:01:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-01-01-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Look, I came from Turning Point USA, so you guys know that me doing this—there's an element of heartache. You don't go into an organization and help to build it up because you one day hope that the founder of it is going to be assassinated so that you can destroy it—the very thing that you helped to build in a very big way. I contributed greatly to Turning Point USA's success, and they would never deny that. And so, it's sad. It is really sad to see this sort of elitist direction that they're taking in: "Oh, we thought you guys would be smarter than to listen to her. Oh, you guys are Antifa." What is that? It's such crap. James Gray writes—sorry, I read that one. Tara writes, "Licensed psychotherapist here. ^t-01-01-23

I would gladly put my license on the line at this point to help in even the smallest of ways—holding you and your family in prayer, Candace." Keep up the prayers. Keep up the prayers. Brittany Watson writes, "Candace, you are not just going max. You are going scorched earth. And after watching Monday's episode when you said that you are not some basic B.I., I was like, 'Girl, take my money.' Thank you for being the world's best crime-fighting superhero." You know, I always think back to this interview that Kanye gave before I knew who he was. And I always loved Kanye. I loved his music. I loved the code of his music, which is you have to believe in yourself because the whole world is going to tell you you can't. ^t-01-02-05

And people that you thought that you would be allies with, you find to be your enemies. Like, that's kind of the coded message of Kanye's music. But there's this interview that he gives where he says— somebody—I don't know what they asked him—but he responds and he says, "You know, if you're a fan of Kanye West, you're not a fan of Kanye West. You're actually a fan of yourself. You believe in yourself and you think that you can do something in this world." And I feel the same way. I think that the people who think that they're fans of mine— you're not fans of Candace. You believe in yourself. ^t-01-02-45

Like, there's that thing—there's that spark inside of you. It's kind of what I got when Kanye said that. It's not me. It's the spark that you see in me. It's the audacity to be yourself and to think your own thoughts and to keep going when the whole world tells you no. That's how I feel. "Candace go max." I love that someone picked up that name as their username. "Thanks for the honest investigations. The truth shall set us all free. Thanks for the USS Liberty episode as well." To this day, the best interview that we have ever given. We were all—you could feel a ^t-01-03-25

I'll never forget that interview. It transformed me. It was a major turning point in my life. And thank you guys more. I mean, I'm so grateful to you guys, and I hope you know that. I start all of my prayers with gratitude, because I started realizing that sometimes when you pray, you're asking for a lot. But if you start with gratitude of the things that you're thankful for—like, you know, when you come to God and you're like, "I would like to—I'm grateful for my health. I'm grateful for this..." By the time you get through all the things that you're grateful for, you're like, "Man, do I really want to lodge any complaints?" It's a good way to pray. And I always say that I am grateful for the people around the world that believed in me ^t-01-04-06

I get time zones wrong. But at least you guys can see that my heart is in the right place and I really do just genuinely want the answers. So I'm glad that we are at long last going to get them from Turning Point USA, it sounds like. Like I said, I'll do this tomorrow. I don't have to be in person. We can live-stream this. I think the people trust me to represent all of the questions that we have. And we can have the money go to Turning Point USA. Every dollar that's raised I would gladly sacrifice that to the organization. That's how much it means to just be able to get these questions answered. Anyways, you guys, we will see you tomorrow. ^t-01-04-46
