It's happening. It's happening. Everybody, stay calm. After yesterday's episode, where we went kind of for the jugular with <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>—because really, I think everybody in the entire world has had enough with the non-response, trying<span id="event-event-2025-09-03-charlie-kirk-requests-doge-department-at-turning-p-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-03-charlie-kirk-requests-doge-department-at-turning-p.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a> to move on, trying to gaslight us<span id="event-event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> on answering basic details— so we just went for it. And guess what? <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> has moved to formally respond to all the things that we have said. <span id="claim-claim-073e4b356ff0-t-00-00-00">And after a very long diatribe in which they wildly misrepresent the public and global investigation of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination, they at long last issued a public invitation or a challenge.<a href="/claims/claim-073e4b356ff0.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> I'm not sure what it is, but I accept, okay? ^t-00-00-00

Pause, reflect. I'm proud of everybody. I'm proud of the world—every single person who was in my inbox giving me tips, the people inside of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-01-31"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> who were leaking, the donors that wrote public letters, or donors that didn't write public letters but sent us messages encouraging us to keep going. Today feels like a win, because guess what? It forced <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> to finally respond, and that was the entire point<span id="event-event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-formally-responds-to-c-t-00-01-31"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-formally-responds-to-c.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, okay? That has been the point of refusing to let up even one second in this investigation. They wanted to simply be able to eulogize <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-31"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> at a big memorial event, and then they wanted us to simply move on, and we didn't do that. ^t-00-01-31

And I would say these were pretty basic questions right out of the gates. Why they didn't do that right out of the gates, nobody knows. We can hear their explanation for why they didn't in just a moment, because they sent <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-02-14"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span> out. <span id="claim-claim-414dbbe62a3b-t-00-02-14"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a>, by the way, is the producer of <span id="ent-work-the-charlie-kirk-show-t-00-02-14"><a href="/entities/work-the-charlie-kirk-show.md">The Charlie Kirk Show</a></span>.<a href="/claims/claim-414dbbe62a3b.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-03-charlie-kirk-requests-doge-department-at-turning-p-t-00-02-14"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-03-charlie-kirk-requests-doge-department-at-turning-p.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake-t-00-02-14"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-02-14

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-02-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=178" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now he is kind of the rotating talent of <span id="ent-work-the-charlie-kirk-show-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/work-the-charlie-kirk-show.md">The Charlie Kirk Show</a></span>. He was already featured with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> on the show, so that's not unusual. But I think we probably anticipated that <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span>, who is the <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a> spokesperson, would have been the person to deliver this message. Maybe, in theory, that should have been his job. Maybe he's traveling. The point is we got <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span>, and I want to say—just to reiterate—that I have always maintained that whatever is going on at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, I have not felt that <a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a> is one of the bad guys, okay? I just have never gotten that particular vibe from him. I believe that when he speaks, he believes that he is telling the truth. And maybe that's why they want him in front of the camera. He's been the only person that has been responding in a way that feels even remotely authentic. ^t-00-02-58

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-03-40.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:40</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=220" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** When he defends the actions of <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-03-40"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span> on that day, I sense that he believes that he is telling the truth. Anyways, let's listen to what <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-03-40"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span> had to say in its entirety. [Clip now attributed to Blake Neff.] It's not going to feel organic. Obviously, he's reading from a piece of paper. This has probably been reviewed 12 times by many different lawyers, because that's how it works at big organizations and companies. But I don't fault him that. I will pause at certain moments, because I do want to be able to respond throughout it. It's a bit long, but I want to give them my platform, as I always have made that offer to. So here is <a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a>. ^t-00-03-40

I said it was suspicious that <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>'s wife—that we never found out who did plan the event. That was one of the answers that we wanted to know. And I said that she works in events. Still was not clear on what happened regarding <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>. I think the entire world believes that his actions are suspicious, because we have eyes. And you don't get to wiggle out of that by pretending that us playing the words of his own father, <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>—who I think is highly suspicious in all of this, he has a suspicious background— ^t-00-05-03

For trying to take photos of young girls. I don't think he's a good guy, and you're not gonna make us forget those things because you are trying to pretend that <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-05-36"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a></span>'s actions were totally normal that day. They weren't. That's why I didn't make the public feel that way, okay? I may have voiced how they felt—which everyone else is refusing to do—but I do believe that <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a> should have to answer for who he had on the phone right when the shot went off. ^t-00-05-36

It's so easy. It's free. If someone said, "Candace, what were you doing when <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-20-34"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was shot?" I'd be like, "I was sitting down at my table, prepping my show." Like, the question doesn't offend me because I had nothing to do with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> dying, okay? This is a psychological technique that is failing. It is failing for you. And you're upset because you thought that with time—with the passage of time—people would let the story go, and they didn't. And these reasons that he's about to list for why they didn't respond to answer any questions are beyond ridiculous. Let's take a listen. ^t-00-20-34

People have wanted us to invite Candace on the show. But for a long time, our approach was to say nothing. We did that for several reasons. First, first, we thought that her prevarications were so absurd that nobody would believe them. We shouldn't have to answer questions about secret tunnels or <span id="ent-org-egyptian-air-force-t-00-21-20"><a href="/entities/org-egyptian-air-force.md">Egyptian Air Force</a></span> planes. That sort of thing is just beneath contempt to respond to. The second reason we've said so little, though, is because there's a good rule of thumb, which <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-21-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> followed. Do not feed the trolls. Focus on the mission. Reviving America, uplifting young people, making heaven crowded. ^t-00-21-20

Lastly, we didn't respond because <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-22-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> always viewed Candace as a friend, and we were holding out hope that she would return that friendship and stop what she was doing." ^t-00-22-05

Like, that's just not the right attitude. I mean, that is an elitist attitude. It is beneath us to respond to the very people who showed up in scores because they were so moved by <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-22-24"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination that they all poured into the <span id="ent-org-staples-center-t-00-22-24"><a href="/entities/org-staples-center.md">Staples Center</a></span>, right?

You should be ashamed to sit across from people who did everything they could to stop <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-33-39"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s rise—breaking bread with them and refusing to have a conversation with me when you know that I cared about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>.

For the last 35 years, <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. And they only use the top 1 or 2% of the entire Angus population as their breeding stock, producing beef that has much more flavor and tenderness than your average Angus beef. Now, each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. All <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> cattle were born and raised here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-35-06"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. And the beef is processed right at their ranch in their award-winning <span id="ent-org-usda-t-00-35-06"><a href="/entities/org-usda.md">USDA</a></span>-inspected processing facility. So you avoid the costly middlemen because the beef is sent directly from their ranch to your home. ^t-00-35-06

And so this article is written with such elitism—the hope that the state will step in and just break it, just bankrupt it. This is an actual quotation: "The lawsuit is set to test whether the controversy-as-currency that made Owens rich and gave her a media brand that reaches tens of millions of people can survive what experts say will be an immensely costly legal battle."

That's why they want to kill us, obviously. That's why they want to drug us and keep us dumb, is because the numbers are not on their side. So we have to make sure it's not just the numbers, but also that the ideology is not on their side. The answer to people that want less families—not because they want you to be more efficient and to climb the corporate ladder—they just want less of you. There needs to be less slaves if you want to maintain control, ^t-00-57-46

That's the true answer—is that that's why they promote all of these things. That's why they want people to have less children—is because they want to increase their numbers while decreasing ours. And so we need to be radical about not also giving our children to the system. If you can—and you can, you absolutely can—homeschool your children. Pull them out of the system. Don't send your kids to college. Usury is another one of their tactics. Don't rack up debt. I made that mistake and learned nothing. It's just more time for them to indoctrinate your children. Be bold in changing the system. Be radical in your response of taking ownership over your own home. That's what I would say in response to that. Goodness wins. Goodness wins. In truth, Christ has already won. ^t-00-58-28

Meryl writes, "Careful Candace, they may be betting that you won't be available for a sit-down the next few weeks. Also watch your sources. Sometimes the feds plant sources with almost good information in order to humiliate their target later." Yes, I'm very aware of that, and we are very cautious about our sources, and sometimes that has happened where—and we haven't gone. Fortunately, we haven't made a public mistake, but we'll keep going. And then I'll be like, "I think this is good." And then Mark will be like, "I don't know about this," or Skylar—"I don't know about this." And that is what takes us so much time every day—is for a small team, but we're constantly having to debate ourselves before we put something out. So thank you for that. <span id="ent-person-briley-t-00-59-13"><a href="/entities/person-briley.md">Briley</a></span> writes, "They didn't answer any of your questions.

That's when he went off script. I don't know that they remember or know how to be authentic like that anymore.
