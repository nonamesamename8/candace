It's happening. It's happening. Everybody, stay calm. After yesterday's episode, where we went kind of for the jugular with <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>—because really, I think everybody in the entire world has had enough with the non-response, trying<span id="event-event-2025-09-03-charlie-kirk-requests-doge-department-at-turning-p-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-03-charlie-kirk-requests-doge-department-at-turning-p.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a> to move on, trying to gaslight us<span id="event-event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> on answering basic details— so we just went for it. And guess what? <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> has moved to formally respond to all the things that we have said. And after a very long diatribe in which they wildly misrepresent the public and global investigation of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination, they at long last issued a public invitation or a challenge. I'm not sure what it is, but I accept, okay? ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-00-44.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=44" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Quite literally, all we have ever asked for were sensible answers to our basic questions about what transpired on <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>. And it looks like we're going to get those things. So major, major win. I am excited. Also, later on in the show, what I have for you<span id="event-event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake-t-00-00-44"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> is <span id="ent-person-the-game-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/person-the-game.md">The Game</a></span> (rapper), who is releasing a song that is entitled "<span id="ent-work-the-assassination-of-candace-owens-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/work-the-assassination-of-candace-owens.md">The Assassination of Candace Owens</a></span>."

Pause, reflect. I'm proud of everybody. I'm proud of the world—every single person who was in my inbox giving me tips, the people inside of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-01-31"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> who were leaking, the donors that wrote public letters, or donors that didn't write public letters but sent us messages encouraging us to keep going. Today feels like a win, because guess what? It forced <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> to finally respond, and that was the entire point<span id="event-event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-formally-responds-to-c-t-00-01-31"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-formally-responds-to-c.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, okay? That has been the point of refusing to let up even one second in this investigation. They wanted to simply be able to eulogize <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-31"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> at a big memorial event, and then they wanted us to simply move on, and we didn't do that. ^t-00-01-31

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-02-14.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:14</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=134" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, so yeah, we should celebrate the fact that we kept up the pressure, that we insisted that we have answers—that even in this tremendous culture of ADHD and everyone's constantly being distracted by their iPhones<span id="event-event-2025-12-03-pentagon-press-secretary-briefed-new-corps-cam-hig-t-00-02-14"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-pentagon-press-secretary-briefed-new-corps-cam-hig.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>—that we kept the focus, okay? <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-14"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> is going to commit to a live-streamed event where they are apparently going to answer all of these lingering questions. And I would say these were pretty basic questions right out of the gates. Why they didn't do that right out of the gates, nobody knows. We can hear their explanation for why they didn't in just a moment, because they sent <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-02-14"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span> out. <a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a>, by the way, is the producer of <span id="ent-work-the-charlie-kirk-show-t-00-02-14"><a href="/entities/work-the-charlie-kirk-show.md">The Charlie Kirk Show</a></span>.<span id="event-event-2025-09-03-charlie-kirk-requests-doge-department-at-turning-p-t-00-02-14"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-03-charlie-kirk-requests-doge-department-at-turning-p.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake-t-00-02-14"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-turning-point-usa-issues-formal-response-via-blake.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-02-14

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-02-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=178" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now he is kind of the rotating talent of <span id="ent-work-the-charlie-kirk-show-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/work-the-charlie-kirk-show.md">The Charlie Kirk Show</a></span>. He was already featured with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> on the show, so that's not unusual. But I think we probably anticipated that <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span>, who is the <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a> spokesperson, would have been the person to deliver this message. Maybe, in theory, that should have been his job. Maybe he's traveling. The point is we got <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span>, and I want to say—just to reiterate—that I have always maintained that whatever is going on at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, I have not felt that <a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a> is one of the bad guys, okay? I just have never gotten that particular vibe from him. I believe that when he speaks, he believes that he is telling the truth. And maybe that's why they want him in front of the camera. He's been the only person that has been responding in a way that feels even remotely authentic. ^t-00-02-58

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-his-JBjlkh8/t-00-03-40.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:40</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=his-JBjlkh8&t=220" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** When he defends the actions of <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-03-40"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span> on that day, I sense that he believes that he is telling the truth. Anyways, let's listen to what <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-03-40"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span> had to say in its entirety. [Clip now attributed to Blake Neff.] It's not going to feel organic. Obviously, he's reading from a piece of paper. This has probably been reviewed 12 times by many different lawyers, because that's how it works at big organizations and companies. But I don't fault him that. I will pause at certain moments, because I do want to be able to respond throughout it. It's a bit long, but I want to give them my platform, as I always have made that offer to. So here is <a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a>. ^t-00-03-40

I said it was suspicious that <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>'s wife—that we never found out who did plan the event. That was one of the answers that we wanted to know. And I said that she works in events. Still was not clear on what happened regarding <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>. I think the entire world believes that his actions are suspicious, because we have eyes. And you don't get to wiggle out of that by pretending that us playing the words of his own father, <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>—who I think is highly suspicious in all of this, he has a suspicious background— ^t-00-05-03

They weren't. That's why I didn't make the public feel that way, okay? I may have voiced how they felt—which everyone else is refusing to do—but I do believe that <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a> should have to answer for who he had on the phone right when the shot went off. ^t-00-05-36

It's not something that you would do. Neither would you just run up onto a grassy knoll and record yourself. Again, these are unusual actions, and rather than trying to pretend like it's normal to record a selfie video of yourself and to prematurely announce that somebody is dead, maybe you should answer why all of that took place— because you guys told lies about—verifiable lies about—why that took place. Because don't forget, <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-09-34"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span> sat next to you and said it was because people were stealing.

I'm just saying they're a lot younger than him. And yeah, I can give you the exact name of the intern that he hooked up with.

People have wanted us to invite <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-21-20"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> on the show. But for a long time, our approach was to say nothing. We did that for several reasons. First, first, we thought that her prevarications were so absurd that nobody would believe them. We shouldn't have to answer questions about secret tunnels or <span id="ent-org-egyptian-air-force-t-00-21-20"><a href="/entities/org-egyptian-air-force.md">Egyptian Air Force</a></span> planes. That sort of thing is just beneath contempt to respond to. The second reason we've said so little, though, is because there's a good rule of thumb, which <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-21-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> followed. Do not feed the trolls. Focus on the mission. Reviving <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-21-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>, uplifting young people, making heaven crowded. ^t-00-21-20

Lastly, we didn't respond because <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-22-05"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> always viewed <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-22-05"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> as a friend, and we were holding out hope that she would return that friendship and stop what she was doing." ^t-00-22-05

Like, that's just not the right attitude. I mean, that is an elitist attitude. It is beneath us to respond to the very people who showed up in scores because they were so moved by <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-22-24"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination that they all poured into the <span id="ent-org-staples-center-t-00-22-24"><a href="/entities/org-staples-center.md">Staples Center</a></span>, right? And poured their tears out and made videos and donated. It is beneath us to not to then respond to questions that you have that are meaningful, because we just think it's so stupid that you would suggest that <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-22-24"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span> are involved in an assassination. That's never happened in American history. What? What? So that's a ridiculous thing. The second thing he says there is, "<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> always said, don't feed the trolls." ^t-00-22-24

So I'm not a troll, okay? I'm not a troll. I'm not trolling. I'm not someone who's hated <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-23-08"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> and wanted <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> to fail. I'm actually the exact opposite of that. And that's why the people believe in me and they trust me, because they feel that I'm the only one that's acting right in this situation. Who wouldn't want to have every stone unturned if they cared about somebody? Who wouldn't want to have every question answered? Who wouldn't be immediately suspicious to see <span id="ent-gpe-egypt-t-00-23-08"><a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a></span> military jets? Who wouldn't go, "Why the hell were these jets around <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> way before—years before—<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination?"

So many times they're just trying to give the vibe that this is so crazy. No, they are fearful. The <a href="/entities/gpe-egypt.md">Egyptian</a> planes hold the key, and that is obvious even in <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-23-52"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span>'s statement. But yeah, I am not a troll, okay?

That's why you're doing this, okay? That is why you are doing this, because your strategy failed. In fact, this is your old-school <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> before they put on the faith pants. This is your old-school <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> lesson in what the free markets are. The free markets saw what you were offering, right? And they saw what I was offering. You were offering, "We should accept this and move on," and I was saying we need to investigate this.

And they are attacking me with zero proof that I made a single dollar off of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s assassination. I did not sell a cup. I did not sell a mug, okay? All I did was do what I already do for a living. Okay? I podcast and I investigate things. I investigate things that I feel passionate about. Sometimes it's Kamala's genealogy when she's saying she wants to be the president and things aren't making sense and I sense that she is lying.

You can't pretend you're going to do it, and then <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-34-23"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> died a mysterious accident. Okay.

For the last 35 years, <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. And they only use the top 1 or 2% of the entire Angus population as their breeding stock, producing beef that has much more flavor and tenderness than your average Angus beef. Now, each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. All <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> cattle were born and raised here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-35-06"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. And the beef is processed right at their ranch in their award-winning <span id="ent-org-usda-t-00-35-06"><a href="/entities/org-usda.md">USDA</a></span>-inspected processing facility. So you avoid the costly middlemen because the beef is sent directly from their ranch to your home. ^t-00-35-06

And so this article is written with such elitism—the hope that the state will step in and just break it, just bankrupt it.

All right, top comment from yesterday's episode. Somebody writes, "The worst part of being awake is realizing there are way more evil people on this planet than I ever thought possible." I actually don't think there's more. I think they have a tremendous amount of power. I think they have control over the military, and I think that power will wane if we stop subjecting ourselves to their systems—their financial systems, their peer pressure systems, <span id="ent-gpe-hollywood-t-00-57-02"><a href="/entities/gpe-hollywood.md">Hollywood</a></span>, you know, the adoration that we had for stars and we followed their trends.

I spoke about it more at length with <span id="ent-person-russell-brand-t-00-57-46"><a href="/entities/person-russell-brand.md">Russell Brand</a></span> on his show, so that should be coming out soon. But we have to become educated about where it stems from. There's less of them, but they have a lot of power and they have a lot of influence, and they have—you know—blackmailed people that are in powerful positions. There's definitively more of us. That's why they want to kill us, obviously. That's why they want to drug us and keep us dumb, is because the numbers are not on their side. So we have to make sure it's not just the numbers, but also that the ideology is not on their side. The answer to people that want less families—not because they want you to be more efficient and to climb the corporate ladder—they just want less of you. There needs to be less slaves if you want to maintain control, ^t-00-57-46

That's the true answer—is that that's why they promote all of these things. That's why they want people to have less children—is because they want to increase their numbers while decreasing ours. And so we need to be radical about not also giving our children to the system. If you can—and you can, you absolutely can—homeschool your children. Pull them out of the system. Don't send your kids to college. Usury is another one of their tactics. Don't rack up debt. I made that mistake and learned nothing. It's just more time for them to indoctrinate your children. Be bold in changing the system. Be radical in your response of taking ownership over your own home. That's what I would say in response to that. Goodness wins. Goodness wins. In truth, Christ has already won. ^t-00-58-28

Also watch your sources. Sometimes <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-59-13"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span> plant sources with almost good information in order to humiliate their target later." Yes, I'm very aware of that, and we are very cautious about our sources, and sometimes that has happened where—and we haven't gone. Fortunately, we haven't made a public mistake, but we'll keep going. And then I'll be like, "I think this is good."

It is so sad that we have reached a time where you guys are legitimately concerned about my safety, and I get that. I get that.

Yeah, he's speaking from a script, but I will say the thing that felt genuine was at the very end when he said, "I owe everything to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-01-00-40"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>." That's when he went off script. I don't know that they remember or know how to be authentic like that anymore.

But there's this interview that he gives where he says— somebody—I don't know what they asked him—but he responds and he says, "You know, if you're a fan of <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-01-02-45"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a></span>, you're not a fan of <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a>.

I start all of my prayers with gratitude, because I started realizing that sometimes when you pray, you're asking for a lot.

By the time you get through all the things that you're grateful for, you're like, "Man, do I really want to lodge any complaints?" It's a good way to pray.
