Let's jump right back into it, back into the investigation because I have some incredibly interesting updates for you. Actually, some explosive revelations regarding the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> case.

And I just want to be clear here: no matter what I say throughout this episode, please remember that they are always the victim, historically have always been the victim, and they have done nothing wrong. Didn't do nothing wrong on 9/10 either. In other news, the McCoys.

Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-45"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span>. Do you know that moment when your subconscious kind of meets your conscious? Like you just suddenly—your subconscious is storing all this information and it's maybe flagging something for you that's a little weird, but you haven't come to realize it yet. And then all of a sudden, the information breaks the surface and you're like, "Aha, I got it." I didn't even realize what that thing that happened a long time ago was a little bit weird. ^t-00-00-45

Sherman address from <span id="ent-gpe-australia-t-00-01-25"><a href="/entities/gpe-australia.md">Australia</a></span>. You guys know that moment. Take a watch. Crime solved, okay? That is how it works. Never ignore your subconscious. That's why I say, pay attention to my dreams. I don't care who has to laugh at me about it. And there was this little something that flagged in the back of my mind as odd in the aftermath of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-25"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s assassination. ^t-00-01-25

Elle Woods in the movie Legally Blonde—she was absolutely correct when she said that people who work out have endorphins and happy people don't kill their husbands. <span id="claim-claim-ad6fbcec435d-t-00-02-07">Anyway, the thing that I realized is that <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-02-07"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>, the chief of staff of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-07"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>—<a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>—for whatever reason, he always requires an adjective<a href="/claims/claim-ad6fbcec435d.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. Whenever they discuss <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>, there's an adjective before they say his name. A bunch of people in the <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> orbit described <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a> in this very unique manner. I want you to take a listen to that. ^t-00-02-07

I used to be known as <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s pastor. Now I'm known as <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>'s dad. He clicked into gear eventually. It was amazing. <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> was a heroic figure on that day. ^t-00-02-50

And objectively speaking, okay—I don't care what your experience in life is—I would not move to insist that someone was quote-unquote "heroic" for walking away from their friend after he was shot. Okay, that wouldn't be the adjective that came to my mind. Heroic. I also don't feel the need ever to qualify any of my friends with an adjective.

In fact, on stage at the memorial event for <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> and elsewhere, they were trying to prime the public for that plausibility—almost like it was this psychological operation<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-12-israeli-cell-phones-detected-at-uvu-during-char-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-12-israeli-cell-phones-detected-at-uvu-during-char.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-07-18-uvu-turning-point-chapter-submits-application-for-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-18-uvu-turning-point-chapter-submits-application-for.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-08-24-rob-mccoy-lists-secondary-home-in-coronado-for-sal-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-24-rob-mccoy-lists-secondary-home-in-coronado-for-sal.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-07-15-rob-mccoy-transitions-to-pastor-emeritus-role-at-g-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-15-rob-mccoy-transitions-to-pastor-emeritus-role-at-g.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-01-01-rob-mccoy-announces-stepping-down-as-senior-pastor-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-01-01-rob-mccoy-announces-stepping-down-as-senior-pastor.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, nod to <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-04-10"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span> and his family lineage—to see <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> as capable of filling <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s shoes.

And when that tragedy struck, <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> was an absolute hero who kept everybody calm and did some of the most mundane things you would think you would need to do on the worst day of his life.

And <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a>, you are now in the driver's seat. The floor is yours. Yeah. It's crazy to think that was just three, four days before <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-10-04"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>.

And <a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake</a> and I got the gift of being able to tag along for that. And so I brought the camera with me. I've never traveled with the camera before, but I decided it would be a good idea to mic <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> up, do some content with him while we're there.

For the first time, he decided to mic him. It's not something that somebody does as a chief of staff. It's not something that somebody does in that role. Okay? I've traveled with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-40"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> everywhere. Very strange. The person that mics is always the AV person. And I would assume there were some AV people that were on hand, given the trip. But anyways, that's not it, okay? That's not just one point that we have. And don't worry because I'm gonna show you—after I've plotted all of this into our timeline—just a few weeks before <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> died, <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-10-40"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span> and his wife, Eliza, for the very first time—now this is according to Eliza McCoy—she shared that it was the first time ever that they went on vacation: her and <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> went on vacation with Erika and <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>. ^t-00-10-40

That second paragraph begins, "We spent a few weeks together this summer, our first family trip together," okay? Getting real close there. And while they were on this very first time together for a couple of weeks vacation, something moved the McCoys to capture intimate and sweet moments of the Kirk family from behind the scenes. Now, you know which footage I'm talking about. It's the footage that has since gone viral of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-11-21"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> walking with his children and Erika. Erika grabs his hand. It's actually a very sweet moment, and it moved a lot of us.

Is it the extraordinarily lucky <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-12-03"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>? Because I was thinking about it because I have a big family, and people with families know.

There's always one person missing from intimate family moments when they're on the fly. They're not planned, right? There tends to be one family member missing because one person grabs the camera, and you're capturing the kids with dad or you're capturing the kids with mom or it's just the kids—whatever it is, that's how family footage when it's organic tends to look, right? ^t-00-12-03

According to my sources, we will nail down these specific dates in the future. We are working on it. Okay. Strikes me as odd that <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-12-45"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a></span> is just picking up the camera and capturing these moments. I don't know.

I'm excited to share with you guys C15, which is from Fatty15—the first emerging essential fatty acid to be discovered in more than 90 years. It's an incredible scientific breakthrough to support our long-term health, wellness, and healthy aging. Based on over 100 studies, we now know that C15 strengthens our cells and is a key healthy aging nutrient which helps slow biological aging at the cellular level. When our cells don't have enough C15, they become fragile, and they age faster. And thankfully, Fatty15 repairs age-related damage to cells, and it protects them from future breakdown. And it activates pathways in the body that help regulate our sleep, our cognitive health, and naturally repair our repair mechanisms. ^t-00-25-55

And everything that's happening in our country, our culture, the corrosion—I think it's because America has married <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-47-26"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionism</a></span>. Like, I truly do believe that. And I think a lot of people are waking up to that. We were a better country when we were a Christian nation. We are no longer a Christian nation.

Congratulations. "I'm nervous, but I know children are God's blessing. Do you have any advice for me as a young mother? Is it okay to be nervous?" My advice would be not to take advice. It is going to be the most natural job that you have. You are going to just know what to do when you see the baby, and it will make you a better person because you will be so tapped into God's creation. You will realize that there is something more. It is one of the sins in the culture that kind of trained us to have children later— is that we don't tap into our divine purpose, and children immediately have you tap into your divine purpose. You feel more wholesome, more confident. ^t-00-48-05

That would guarantee that their future would be compromised—could be more compromised than our lives are right now.
