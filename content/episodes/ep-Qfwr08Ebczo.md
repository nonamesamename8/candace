**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-00-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. Let's jump right back into it, back into the investigation because I have some incredibly interesting updates for you. Actually, some explosive revelations regarding the Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) case. Now buckle up because there's this country that's only the size of New Jersey. It's always the victim. It turns out that they had some people on the ground that day. And I just want to be clear here: no matter what I say throughout this episode, please remember that they are always the victim, historically have always been the victim, and they have done nothing wrong. Didn't do nothing wrong on 9/10 either. In other news, the McCoys. Let's jump back into their story because I've learned some crazy, interesting data points to add to our timeline. You know, I love me a timeline. ^t-00-00-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=45" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-00-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So let's jump back in. Welcome back to Candace (Candace Owens). Do you know that moment when your subconscious kind of meets your conscious? Like you just suddenly—your subconscious is storing all this information and it's maybe flagging something for you that's a little weird, but you haven't come to realize it yet. And then all of a sudden, the information breaks the surface and you're like, "Aha, I got it." I didn't even realize what that thing that happened a long time ago was a little bit weird. ^t-00-00-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=85" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-01-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And suddenly, you're behaving like Dory, the blue fish from the movie Finding Nemo, when she remembers the P. Sherman address from Australia. You guys know that moment. Take a watch. Crime solved, okay? That is how it works. Never ignore your subconscious. That's why I say, pay attention to my dreams. I don't care who has to laugh at me about it. And there was this little something that flagged in the back of my mind as odd in the aftermath of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. ^t-00-01-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=127" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-02-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** One of these things that might seem small, but it's always the small details that help to paint the broader and bigger picture, right? Elle Woods in the movie Legally Blonde—she was absolutely correct when she said that people who work out have endorphins and happy people don't kill their husbands. Anyway, the thing that I realized is that Mikey McCoy, the chief of staff of Turning Point USA—Mikey McCoy—for whatever reason, he always requires an adjective. Whenever they discuss Mikey McCoy, there's an adjective before they say his name. A bunch of people in the Turning Point USA orbit described Mikey McCoy in this very unique manner. I want you to take a listen to that. ^t-00-02-07

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=170" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-02-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Let me tell you who the heroes were in this whole thing. We're gonna start with 23-year-old Mikey McCoy. And that's when the great Mikey McCoy showed up. And my husband's chief of staff, the amazing Mikey McCoy. My friend Mikey McCoy, the brilliant 24-year-old who at the time when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot was 23 and was a hero that day. I used to be known as Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s pastor. Now I'm known as Mikey McCoy's dad. He clicked into gear eventually. It was amazing. Mikey was a heroic figure on that day. ^t-00-02-50

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=205" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-03-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Amazing, heroic—he was brilliant. It stood out to me really because it's only Mikey that they moved to do it for. And objectively speaking, okay—I don't care what your experience in life is—I would not move to insist that someone was quote-unquote "heroic" for walking away from their friend after he was shot. Okay, that wouldn't be the adjective that came to my mind. Heroic. I also don't feel the need ever to qualify any of my friends with an adjective. Think about how strange it would be if on this show, every time I cover Tucker (Tucker Carlson), I was like, "The spectacular Tucker (Tucker Carlson), the breathtaking Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is under attack in this moment." ^t-00-03-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=250" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-04-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You'd be like, why are you doing that? Why do I feel like you're trying to program me? This only made me more interested in Mikey and the McCoy story. And I wanna be super clear here: knowing y'all, though, I don't think that—I know that Mikey McCoy did not kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk). We watch him in those moments, but it's also becoming pretty apparent to me that the stage was being set for Mikey to become the new Charlie (Charlie Kirk). In fact, on stage at the memorial event for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and elsewhere, they were trying to prime the public for that plausibility—almost like it was this psychological operation, nod to Rob McCoy and his family lineage—to see Mikey as capable of filling Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s shoes. Take a listen. ^t-00-04-10

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=293" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:53</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-04-53.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Let me tell you something about Mikey. Mikey's been with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) for several years. He's 23 years old. He is wise beyond his years. And when that tragedy struck, Mikey was an absolute hero who kept everybody calm and did some of the most mundane things you would think you would need to do on the worst day of his life. And he continues to be a rock. He's been following Jesus for a long time. I'm hoping that Mikey one day will follow in Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s footsteps right to the college campus because he has the ability, the demeanor, the grace, the knowledge to do so. ^t-00-04-53

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=334" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-05-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Set an example for the believers in speech and conduct and love and faith and purity. Our speaker today, Mikey McCoy, has done that. His path was pretty much like Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s path. Pretty much like Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s path. And he's got the grace and the wits and every—it's amazing, okay? ^t-00-05-34

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=363" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-06-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And if you're wondering why we also included Erica saying "the amazing Mikey McCoy" in her first speech, it's because Rob McCoy oddly refers back to Erica's speech when he is asked specifically what he believes Mikey's future is going to be at Turning Point USA, okay? He's gonna start—you're gonna see—he's gonna answer a question. The show is Faith, the Faith Forward Show. And he starts to answer the question, but then he sort of cuts himself off and he trails into a different topic, almost as if he catches himself. Take a listen. ^t-00-06-03

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=396" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-06-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** And then Mikey specifically, like how he's going to kind of fit into that picture. 'Cause when I'm seeing him speak, man, I'm like, dude, this Mikey is going to have a humongous role within this organization. So Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was an avid journaler—journaler—very avid. And when Erica started opening up his journals after he was killed, she started reading. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had a plan all the way through 2028 written out—written out. I mean, there's an order of succession. And so when she comes out and she says "the amazing"—I think she said "the amazing Mikey McCoy"— and this is one of the things I would share with Mikey. I'd share with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I learned it from Steve Smotherman. And Pastor Steve Smotherman said it to Charlie (Charlie Kirk): ^t-00-06-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=443" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:23</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-07-23.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** "Where you're a public figure, you have very little privacy." That was weird, right? That's a weird way to try to answer that question. ^t-00-07-23

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=456" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-07-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** What's he doing there? Is he trying to make us believe—but not explicitly state, but kind of explicitly state or maybe implicitly state—that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s future or rather Mikey McCoy's future was written by Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in one of these journals? That's what I was picking up. That's what I feel like he was throwing down. Let me know if I'm crazy, but that was a weird way to answer. And he's like, so when Erica comes out and she says "the amazing Mikey McCoy," he talks about the journals. What's going on here? Now, I'm going to give you some data points to back this up. Now, I maintain that the wonderful Mikey McCoy doesn't strike me as intrinsically evil. Something Charlie (Charlie Kirk) used to always say to me is "the eyes are the window to the soul." ^t-00-07-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=499" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-08-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I don't see this intrinsic evil when I look at Mikey McCoy's eyes, but however, I do think he was hyped, okay? I think Mikey was promised or told or encouraged that he would become the new Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And it is a fact that that was the number one sentiment that we received from our Turning Point USA insiders following Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination—that the, you know, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Mikey McCoy appeared to have like an extra spring in his step that made them all a little bit uncomfortable in the aftermath, and that he seemed all too happy to assume Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s position. Look, he's already speaking at Liberty University. Why? Because he made some phone calls? ^t-00-08-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=544" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-09-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Have we lowered the standards for what makes somebody a hero in 2025? I don't know. And I will say that beyond the sentiment that was expressed to us from Turning Point USA insiders, there are some interesting facts. Fact number one: for whatever reason, in the month—and I'm going to make sure that I address my timeline here— in the month leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s death, Mikey McCoy was interested in capturing some behind-the-scenes footage, more intimate moments of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s life. And I'm gonna give you two examples of that, okay? Example number one: Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s very last overseas trip to Korea. ^t-00-09-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=588" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-09-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** This was four days before he died. For whatever reason, Mikey McCoy felt suddenly inspired to try his luck miking up Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and capturing him on the road. And he says this is the first time he ever did it. Take a listen to Mikey McCoy explain that. ^t-00-09-48

**🎤 SPEAKER_4**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=604" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-10-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** Today is really fun because Mikey and Blake are going to talk about their last trip with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to Asia. And Mikey, you are now in the driver's seat. The floor is yours. Yeah. It's crazy to think that was just three, four days before Utah. And it was Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s dream to always go to Asia. And Blake and I got the gift of being able to tag along for that. And so I brought the camera with me. I've never traveled with the camera before, but I decided it would be a good idea to mic Charlie (Charlie Kirk) up, do some content with him while we're there. Okay? ^t-00-10-04

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=640" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-10-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That is remarkable, obviously. For the first time, he decided to mic him. It's not something that somebody does as a chief of staff. It's not something that somebody does in that role. Okay? I've traveled with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) everywhere. Very strange. The person that mics is always the AV person. And I would assume there were some AV people that were on hand, given the trip. But anyways, that's not it, okay? That's not just one point that we have. And don't worry because I'm gonna show you—after I've plotted all of this into our timeline—just a few weeks before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, Mikey McCoy and his wife, Eliza, for the very first time—now this is according to Eliza McCoy—she shared that it was the first time ever that they went on vacation: her and Mikey went on vacation with Erica and Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-10-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=681" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:21</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-11-21.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Here's that post on Instagram. That second paragraph begins, "We spent a few weeks together this summer, our first family trip together," okay? Getting real close there. And while they were on this very first time together for a couple of weeks vacation, something moved the McCoys to capture intimate and sweet moments of the Kirk family from behind the scenes. Now, you know which footage I'm talking about. It's the footage that has since gone viral of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) walking with his children and Erica. Erica grabs his hand. It's actually a very sweet moment, and it moved a lot of us. People were—I know I was—crying when I first saw this footage a couple of days after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died. Well, let me tell you guys something. ^t-00-11-21

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=723" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-12-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Fortunately, the McCoys were the ones that captured that footage. See, my thing is I need to know what moved them to do that. Are they really just that extraordinary? Is it the extraordinarily lucky Mikey McCoy? Because I was thinking about it because I have a big family, and people with families know. And you can go through Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s Instagram as I have done. There's always one person missing from intimate family moments when they're on the fly. They're not planned, right? There tends to be one family member missing because one person grabs the camera, and you're capturing the kids with dad or you're capturing the kids with mom or it's just the kids—whatever it is, that's how family footage when it's organic tends to look, right? ^t-00-12-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=765" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-12-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And of course, on holidays, you get together, you stand up, you capture a picture. That is the pattern. If you go through Erica [and] Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s Instagram, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s missing or Erica's missing. And that's because they're filming each other. But thankfully the McCoys were on hand in what looks like mid-July or early August into early August. According to my sources, we will nail down these specific dates in the future. We are working on it. Okay. Strikes me as odd that Mikey is just picking up the camera and capturing these moments. I don't know. I don't know for the first time ever. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. And if I'm in Erica's position, I'm starting to look at him funny. What's going on here? Okay. Now let's bring in Daddy McCoy. ^t-00-12-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=807" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-13-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Wouldn't say he strikes me as something else entirely. And he similarly had some rather impeccable timing. Rob McCoy, as you very well know, was the senior pastor of the Godspeak Calvary Chapel in Thousand Oaks, California. You should also know, by the way—let me introduce this to you right now—because I didn't know that he was funded; his church was funded by the Wilks Brothers down in Texas. The Wilks Brothers are the ones that fund DailyWire, the initial seed money behind DailyWire—not the initial seed money behind PragerU, but they majorly fund PragerU as well. So that's an interesting web that's being woven before our eyes, right? ^t-00-13-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=850" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-14-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You've got PragerU, and now you've got this church, and they are a part of what is described online as a cult. It's like Christians for Jews. You look into it yourself. I honestly can't explain it, but that's just something that you should know in the background. Anyway, for whatever reason, after 17 years as the head pastor of that church, Rob McCoy—it was publicly announced in January of this year—that he would be stepping down as the head pastor and instead assuming the role of pastor emeritus. Now for the uninitiated, emeritus is basically just an honorific title, right? Bestowed upon someone after they retire from some distinguished position. ^t-00-14-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=894" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-14-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** For Rob McCoy, they had planned that transition. That transition took effect in mid-July of this year. Mid-July of this year is when he officially steps down from the church. A lot going on here in McCoyland. Now, in case you're thinking, "Well, that doesn't mean that he was doing all of that and transitioning because he was anticipating some bigger role at Turning Point USA and maybe therefore planning to wind down his life in California," no. Actually, that's exactly the reason that was cited when it was reported on in January in the Ventura County Star. They wrote, quote, "He's approaching a transition in July. ^t-00-14-54

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=933" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-15-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He'll step down as the senior pastor of Godspeak and hand the reins to his son-in-law, Micah Stevens, the church's administrative and worship pastor. McCoy will become the emeritus pastor and will still preach regularly at the church in a role that could last into the mid-70s." And then it goes on to say, "When McCoy's responsibilities grew at Turning Point USA, he and his wife sold their home in Thousand Oaks and bought a home in the Phoenix area." Now, he said that he bought a different place in Thousand Oaks. He also owns a home in Coronado near San Diego. Now, what we can confirm to you is that Rob actually put that secondary home in Coronado up for sale on August 24th, 2025, of this year. ^t-00-15-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=977" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-16-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He listed his home up for sale. So suffice it to say that the fantastic, heroic, sensational McCoys were pretty busy this summer, and I don't like it at all. I just don't like it. The vibes for me are not good. Now we can take a look at our timeline here with these new moves added into it. We're gonna start looking at July 11th because that's when I think things reached some sort of a pinnacle. That's the infamous speech that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) gave where he calls out Bill Ackman. He starts talking about Israel, all this stuff, and things start moving, okay? ^t-00-16-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1016" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-16-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now you can see that's July 11th, and he says that people who serve in foreign armies should be stripped of their citizenship. He muses about where Bill Ackman's wealth comes from. July 18th is our next date on our timeline. And this came from—this is a great find from Sam Parker— that is when Turning Point USA receives a request from UVU for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to hold an event at Utah Valley. Not only do they instantly accept this request, but they also make it his first stop, which is incredible. We can listen to a news anchor. ^t-00-16-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1054" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-17-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I think this is from Fox News Salt Lake City describe exactly when that request went out—as we're telling you, on July 18th. Take a listen. ^t-00-17-34

**🎤 SPEAKER_5**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1063" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-17-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_5:** Utah Valley University has provided the document that created the rally at which conservative activist Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot to death. But it is not providing the security plan for that day. I'm Fox 13 investigative reporter Nate Carlisle. We've been asking UVU for records related to the September 10th Kirk rally. After about six weeks, this is the first record provided. It's the application submitted mid-July by the UVU chapter of Kirk's Turning Point USA. The applicants answer standard questions about time, place, and a description of the event. However, we noticed there is one question not asked on the form: whether organizers need any police protection. ^t-00-17-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1104" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-18-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_5:** That's a standard inquiry at, for example, University of Utah events. Speaking of police, UVU has denied FOX 13 News' request for a copy of the Kirk Rally security plan. The university is citing the provision in state records laws, keeping confidential, quote, "security measures," end quote. The campus also has expressed concern that the records could interfere in any investigation and someone's right to a fair trial. Tyler Robinson is charged with Kirk's murder. Fox 13 plans an appeal of the denial, and we are still pursuing a variety of records related to the Kirk shooting. ^t-00-18-24

For them to honor a request— I mean, they get every university across all 50 states trying to get Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and me to speak, okay? A request going in that late, being honored and becoming stop number one within a couple of weeks— I'm gonna say that's never happened. I'm gonna dig through my inbox, okay? I'm gonna dig through my inbox. I'm gonna see what the normal security protocols are because as everybody has noticed, there was no ambulance on standby, and that's against Utah law. ^t-00-19-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1183" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:43</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-19-43.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And so it's interesting that they don't want to release the security plan because I'm pretty sure this was an extraordinary first-time thing where they didn't have a security plan. And I had received a tip—and I do want to check this out, by the way—that they also had initially slated for this event to be inside, but it was moved. Again, I have to look into that. I'm not confirming that, but if that's true as well, things are about to get very interesting. And guess what, guys? There's more. And this part is crazy. I guess it's not really crazy. I think I saw like Milo Yiannopoulos tweeted, "Now I think Israel did it." And that's because he was tweeting about the bizarre lie of them saying Erica Kirk was accepting this award and they completely fictionalized it. They've just been lying nonstop quickly, right? ^t-00-19-43

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1226" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:20:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-20-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Right out the gate, Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi Netanyahu) doing propaganda rounds, denying that he had anything to do with the assassination of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—perfectly normal thing to do, right? Perfectly normal. For some reason, I didn't feel compelled to do that. I didn't feel like I had to get on camera and make a statement that I didn't kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk), but Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi Net and Yahoo) felt that he needed to do that. And all of his sicko fans in America echoed that statement, and nobody had accused them. A thief runneth when no one pursueth, right? Well, here's some explosive news for you that I can now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, confirm. Putting my name on this. ^t-00-20-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1263" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:21:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-21-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Not only can I confirm this, but I can publicly challenge the very Zionist-occupied Trump administration—who is aware of this—to deny it. To come out and say, "No, that's not true." Okay? And if Kash Patel is done crying about the mean tweets on the internet regarding his sensational singing girlfriend, he can also certainly make the time of day to deny what I am saying if it is untrue, right? Because this is pretty relevant. Now, I should say that some people had actually reported this earlier. Like Mel—I've been telling you to follow her, Village Crazy Lady over on X. ^t-00-21-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1299" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:21:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-21-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** She was actually very early with this reporting, and I had heard rumors and rumblings, but I wanted to make sure that I had verifiable proof—enough proof that I would go out on a limb as I'm doing right now and asserting that it is authentic and it is real. Ladies and gentlemen, there were—for whatever reason—12 Israeli cell phones on the ground at Utah Valley University the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. This has completely spooked the people that are very high up in government. Now, to be clear, I don't mean that there were 12 VPNs that were switched and routed through Israel on that day. ^t-00-21-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1337" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:22:17</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-22-17.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I mean that there were 12 personal cell phone accounts that were opened in Israel, okay? Like you go into Verizon in Tennessee or in Connecticut and you open your phone— I am saying that they opened their phones in Israel—those accounts in Israel—and they were on the ground on September 10th at Utah Valley University when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot. Now, the NSA knows this. Kash Patel knows this. People in the current administration know this, and they are desperate for some reason to stop that information from being released to the public. Why? Because they're the most transparent administration ever? Is that why? Is this like Jeffrey Epstein transparency that we're getting? ^t-00-22-17

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=1382" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:23:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-23-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Because that's what it feels like. It always seems that on the topic of this one nation that's only the size of New Jersey and has done nothing wrong ever and was truly the greatest friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) right up until the very end—never put any pressure on him—suddenly everybody abandoned their values: true friends of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), right? Standing on that stage, giving him a speech, hiding this. Now, what would be the reason that they wanted to keep that information under wraps? And why does it have people at the very top spooked? If there's nothing to hide, then there's nothing to hide. Okay? If there's nothing to hide, then there's nothing to hide. Now let's play devil's advocate. ^t-00-23-02

Maybe the cell phones belonged to some exchange students. It's possible. Maybe 12 Israelis were touring UVU on that day because—I don't know—Utah Valley University is a place where they maybe wanted to attend in the future. Maybe 12 American students had Israeli-based cell phones because they had just come back from a summer abroad program and they wanted to keep their Israeli cell phones running when they got back home to Utah. I don't know, but I'd like to know. In fact, we need to know the answer to this question: ^t-00-23-43

And who did those 12 Israeli cell phones belong to? Okay? I don't like secrets. I don't like secrets, especially when they pertain to the public execution of my friend, Charlie (Charlie Kirk). We'll take a break, and we'll come right back. All right, you guys—jumping in here to tell you about PreBorn! Rather, to remind you about PreBorn! Because you guys know that lately I have been feeling that we all must be courageous. We have to stop playing defense. We shouldn't be watering down the truth to what people find palatable because, of course, silence is not kindness. It's actually consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds the topic of those whose lives are lost before they even take their first breath. ^t-00-24-27

That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. And you can do that for just $28. That's what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion. $28 helps her to see the light that is growing inside of her. It gives her truth that our culture doesn't. So don't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. Be unapologetically pro-life. Go to preborn.org/Candace (Candace Owens) right now. You can give $28, or you can give 10 times that amount if you'd like to. This is definitely the line that we have to stand on. If we stand for truth, we have to do what's right, and we can save lives from abortion and stand firm in our gospel. Again, preborn.org/Candace (Candace Owens) to provide an ultrasound for just $28. ^t-00-25-10

I'm excited to share with you guys C15, which is from Fatty15—the first emerging essential fatty acid to be discovered in more than 90 years. It's an incredible scientific breakthrough to support our long-term health, wellness, and healthy aging. Based on over 100 studies, we now know that C15 strengthens our cells and is a key healthy aging nutrient which helps slow biological aging at the cellular level. When our cells don't have enough C15, they become fragile, and they age faster. And thankfully, Fatty15 repairs age-related damage to cells, and it protects them from future breakdown. And it activates pathways in the body that help regulate our sleep, our cognitive health, and naturally repair our repair mechanisms. ^t-00-25-55

What does this feel like to you? What does this feel like to you? Sometimes I wish I was born yesterday, right? It would be so easy to just accept it and be like, "Oh yeah, I totally—there just was a lone shooter who, you know, had never really been hunted, but he got really lucky, and he just fired this shot, and he got—he'd never been to the campus, but he somehow knew how to scale all the buildings, running around like Spider-Man."

I am looking at a situation where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was betrayed and is actively being betrayed every day by the very people that he helped to elect—the people that are in office. They are betraying him by trying to feed us this nonsense, okay? They are feeding us—they're selling us crap and trying to tell us it's food, right? Like if this is nourishing or something. I just won't tolerate it, okay? And it is—I think one of the craziest things happening right now—that these people are now telling us to shift gears and that it's our duty, right? ^t-00-28-01

Now there are a lot of people running around right now. There are races—important races, they tell us—going on in the country, consequential races that are happening. And people online are being somewhat accusatory, upset that Republicans are infighting—if that's what you're calling this. I'm not fighting with you, okay? I'm gonna see this thing all the way through. And that we're instead focused on using our platforms to fight one another rather than to encourage people to go vote so that Republicans can stay in power across various cities. As just one example, of course, people really cannot stop speaking about the Mom Donnie versus the Cuomo mayoral race in New York. ^t-00-28-43

And to those very many people, I would like to say, "No, I'm good, actually." I'm just not interested. I'm interested in nothing until you start telling the truth about what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—until you acknowledge that a 30-06 did not go through his neck, did not get stopped rather by his neck—until you acknowledge that that story that you tried to sell us is complete BS: something that could take down a moose somehow did not take down Charlie (Charlie Kirk).

I'm not interested in your races around the country. I'm not voting until this is resolved, okay? This is toxic. You are toxic. And it is unbelievably abusive to suggest that I have to now reinvest and work for the exact same party that told me that if I voted for them and got the word out for them—and I did do all of those things—that things would be different. Corruption is going to stop. We're going to be the most transparent administration that you've ever seen—except on those Epstein files. Yeah, I know he was like abusing children, but what Epstein files are we even talking about? No. No, thank you. No. ^t-00-30-11

Goodbye. Not doing it anymore. You're left versus right. Don't care anymore. There is power, and there is the rest of us. There is power, and there is the rest of us. And you are not going to convince me that any of this stuff is consequential after I just watched Charlie (Charlie Kirk) catch a bullet in his throat and watching all of you lie about it, okay? There's actually this vintage clip from TRL. Remember Total Request Live with Carson Daly? That perfectly embodies me and how I am feeling in this moment.

Anyway, two of the three people that I still like that are within the realm of politics got together. Tucker (Tucker Carlson) joined Dave Smith. I kind of want to qualify Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I feel like I want to say "the stupendous Tucker (Tucker Carlson)" joined Dave Smith on his show to respond to all of this Zionist backlash that he was receiving for having a conversation with Nick Fuentes.

I just want to know what this is about. And I wanted to make the point that I often make—and now seems even more important than it ever has—which is that virtue and sin are not transmitted genetically. There is no such thing as blood guilt. Therefore, collective punishment is always immoral. God created each person individually. He did not create communities at once—created people. And all of us will die and in the end face God alone. So it's about the person, and people can be changed by God, by the way. And the New Testament is that story of people who were—in the case of the whole hero of the New Testament, the human hero—was a guy called Paul, was murdering Christians as a Pharisee and then becomes the greatest proselytizer from the history of Christianity—and my personal hero. ^t-00-33-02

Now that is the basis—that position is the basis of Western civilization. We often talk about Western civilization, and we're all defending Western civilization. Israel is defending Western civilization. Israel does not have a Western position on this question. The Israeli position—not of all Israelis, by the way, and certainly not of all Jews—but I'm saying of the Israeli government and of a couple of its ministers, which they say this out loud all the time—is that everybody who's related to a terrorist shares in his guilt. That's collective punishment. It is blood guilt, and it's antithetical to Christianity and to the West. And so for me—and by the way, Israel is not the only country that does this. Most countries do this. Literally most countries do this. All of Asia, India—this is like an intuitive response that people have. ^t-00-33-47

And actually, we're kind of in this weird psychosis as a society. And I would say that this is kind of one of the things they're trying to deliver to us: that some people are just deplorable. Like everything about them is just so deplorable, and we have to throw them away. And that's what creates these sort of movements where people are just tired of it. They're just tired of this. This is not the way that Christians think, actually. We very much don't live in a Christian society because we live in a Christian Zionist society. And Christian Zionism is a... It's a paradox, okay? There's no such thing as Christian Zionism because Zionism is all about identity, right? It's all about identity. Because I am a Jew, I therefore have a right to this land.

Now I think he was one of my favorite people in the world—not just politically, but personally. Like, forgiveness is essential. People change. Allow for that.

And you realize there's a different spirit moving within these and within these groups, right? And he is what Christianity is, right? It's about forgiveness. It's about when you're angry, not assuming that there's some like blood oath that you need to honor, but saying, "You know what? Nick Fuentes has said some crappy things about me, and I'm going to speak to him." I did the same thing. I was like the bigger person—hosted him. And he was, by the way, still a jerk.

I know what your faith is. It's Zionism, okay? You guys behave like gangsters. You behave like you are only loyal to one another, and you'll come beat up any person—figuratively. You'll take care of any person that gets in your way. And the world can see that now. So what's your next move? To just keep doing this, to just keep behaving like this, and just know that every act that you make—every show, everything that you make go viral with you speaking in the way that you speak—and then people get to hear Tucker (Tucker Carlson). He gets bigger, and you get smaller, okay? He gets bigger. Our ideas get bigger. Your ideas get smaller because people can perceive the nastiness that's guiding it, and they want nothing to do with it, okay? ^t-00-37-55

And we're gonna get deeper, by the way, into that sort of guiding theology when we get back into the Sigmund Freud book because it really, really connects dots for you. Right? What that guiding philosophy comes from is actually a psychology. It is a psychology, and he's the father of it—as they call him, the father of modern psychology. And so really stepping back into time and understanding what was happening at the turn of the 19th century across Europe—why so many speech laws have been passed in Europe—kind of Christians in the way that we're doing right now, waking up and going, "What is the guiding philosophy of these people that seem like they hate us? ^t-00-38-31

This book is really an aha moment, and I'm excited for the book club. I'm excited, and I understand why Zionists infiltrated it, but we're not going to stop. But first, let's get to a couple of sponsors. Then I'm going to answer some of your comments. All right, you guys—jumping in here to remind you about Tax Network USA because there are tons of people who owe back taxes, and some people have not even filed their tax returns. ^t-00-39-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=2382" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:39:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-39-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Well, the October 15 deadline has officially passed. If you forgot to file for an extension or if you haven't yet gathered all of your documents or made any estimated payments, you could soon be targeted by the IRS. They can garnish your wages. They can freeze your bank accounts. They can even seize your property. But there is in fact help available. Tax Network USA is a nationwide tax firm, and they've helped taxpayers save over $1 billion in tax debt. They have filed hundreds of thousands of tax returns, and they've assisted thousands in reducing their tax burdens, and they can definitely help you too. So do not wait. Visit tnusa.com/Candace (Candace Owens), or you can call 1-800-958-1000 for a 100% free consultation. ^t-00-39-42

So take action now before it's too late. Visit tnusa.com/Candace (Candace Owens) or call 1-800-958-1000. And telling you guys about American Financing, as I always do. The Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that is good news for American homeowners. If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than now to get your finances in order. It's kind of hard to think about the holidays when everything gets so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. With rates dropping, now is the time to pay off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. ^t-00-40-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=2469" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:41:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-41-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** They're saving people just like you an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in the low fives. That is a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. And if you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, which will give you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before we know it, so don't wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today. You can call American Financing at 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210, or visit americanfinancing.net/Owens. Again, that's americanfinancing.net/Owens. All right, top comment from yesterday. I'm gonna start pulling the top comment that makes me chuckle. ^t-00-41-09

It was so weird. This user wrote—Cheryl writes—"After hearing Kash Patel's tweet, I'm 90% sure he's the one that wrote Tyler's message to his furry lover." Absolutely, you are correct. It's now a fact. It's now a fact. Just kidding. But I loved that comment. All right, comments from today's episode. Laughing Cats Music World writes, "I keep thinking about George Zinn. I know he was a habitual Salt Lake City event disruptor, but what are the chances his reflex is to take the blame voluntarily? I guess it's possible, but wow—crazy split decision to make, right? Not even a hesitation." I told you guys that we had a source leaked to us. ^t-00-41-54

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=2558" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:42:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-42-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He went to the hospital. He went to Utah Valley Hospital after this event to treat some of his like mild injuries from being dragged. And he told people that he was told to do it, and he was paid to do it. But he didn't know where the payment was coming from. So yeah, this entire thing was just an operation. Like I said, Brandon Hansen writes, "Been a lifelong Israel supporter. Recently I've come to not like Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu), but I still love the land where the Lord was born—a Zionist who dislikes Netanyahu." Curious how you feel about that love from Maine. At least makes me happy to hear you acknowledge that there's a demon. I don't—it's the strangest thing to me when these people are treating Benjamin Netanyahu (BB net and Yahoo) like he is their Christ. And that is what makes it ^t-00-42-38

But to misinterpret the Bible so much that you're basically platforming and honoring what Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi Netanyahu) does—avoiding the topic, not acknowledging that what he's doing to the Palestinians is wrong. Having love for Jerusalem—that makes sense. Having love for and to be able to walk in Jerusalem and to see the relics—that all makes sense to me. And I think I'm just more disgusted by people who turn a blind eye to everything that's happened to the Palestinians. It just makes me sick. And to see him on camera acting like such a gangster and people pretending that he's holy—where there's even a shred ^t-00-43-16

There's way more proof to the contrary, which they stopped printing—even their own textbooks, which they've stopped printing—that points to the fact that they came from Turkey: the Turkic Ashkenazi tribe that came down, began speaking Yiddish, and then needed a place to go after World War II. It's crazy to me. The whole thing's crazy. Again, I would debate anybody on that topic—definitely feeling especially fired up about it. Smokey Mountain Kitty writes, "Always trust your gut. Our brain takes in far more information than we are aware of. I love your show and all that you do." Thank you so much. Beck Build writes, "So glad Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had you. ^t-00-43-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=2680" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:44:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-44-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** On another topic, dinosaurs: hundreds of Bible-believing PhD scientists have evidence that dinosaurs are real, killed during the global flood of Genesis. The Institute for Creation Research, Answers in Genesis, and Creation." Okay, guys, I'm sorry. Nope. Sorry. And this is going to get—I bet you the people that are going through my book club—by the end of this, you're going to see that there was a conscious movement—as I said at the end—at the turn of the century. Same time they started going, "Oh, we found dinosaur bones." And then you get into like the research of you come from an osteopithecus. And they describe this as like, "Oh, suddenly science was peaking." And actually what was happening is they wanted to make people invest in scientism. ^t-00-44-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=2719" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:45:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-45-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's a C.S. Lewis perspective. He writes about that in one of his books where they wanted to turn science into God. And as long as they say there's an expert—there's research, experts say that—people would fall into line. And that's what we see happening. So I can't do a deep dive on the dinosaur thing right now, but the book club—we're going to go there eventually. And I just can—I don't know. I just—I see a bigger picture, a broader picture now: removing the Bibles from classrooms, teaching people that they're homo sapiens and they started walking straight—but also the monkeys are still here. It was very methodical. And yeah, broader conversation to have. I can't wait for that clip to go viral, by the way—like I care. ^t-00-45-19

That's crazy—more scientism. Anyways, Smoky—I'm sorry. Christine writes, "Loyalty is rare. Christ is King." Indeed He is. Beth Mitchum writes, "So we give Israel billions. People who support Israel give AIPAC money to give to our government to vote the way Israel wants. So my tax money pays for Israeli ideas. We pay Congress twice. Can you say money laundering?" Yeah, that's what it feels like for sure. We give our tax dollars—they go overseas. And then they yell at us for paying attention to what they're doing overseas and then call us anti-Semitic. This is like the worst deal ever. And I'd like that deal to be undone. ^t-00-46-02

Jennifer Kay writes, "Just asked Grok if Israel and Egypt coordinate on intelligence ops. It says yes, calling their cooperation unprecedented. Since the 1979 peace treaty, intel chiefs have met often, share real-time data. Honestly, few countries make more sense working together." Yeah. Country A that gets most of our money is Israel. B is Egypt. And there is a reason for that. So it doesn't look like it's all going to Israel. That's my perspective. Darth Phantom writes: "Citizens have—and I would say since the 1967 war—do you think that they would let Israel control the Sinai Peninsula?" Anyways, more on that later. Darth Phantom writes: "Citizens have always paid taxes to finally be able to retire. And the thanks that we get— ^t-00-46-45

Am I the only one angered about this?" Yeah, it's all coming apart. We're realizing it's all one big scam. It's all usury—uh—and it is a sin. And everything that's happening in our country, our culture, the corrosion—I think it's because America has married Zionism. Like, I truly do believe that. And I think a lot of people are waking up to that. We were a better country when we were a Christian nation. We are no longer a Christian nation. We are an occupied nation with an ideology that has produced filth in our culture. Miranda writes: "Hi Candace (Candace Owens), I'm 23, ^t-00-47-26

Miranda writes: "Candace (Candace Owens), I'm 23 and newly married. We just found out that I'm pregnant." Congratulations. "I'm nervous, but I know children are God's blessing. Do you have any advice for me as a young mother? Is it okay to be nervous?" My advice would be not to take advice. It is going to be the most natural job that you have. You are going to just know what to do when you see the baby, and it will make you a better person because you will be so tapped into God's creation. You will realize that there is something more. It is one of the sins in the culture that kind of trained us to have children later— is that we don't tap into our divine purpose, and children immediately have you tap into your divine purpose. You feel more wholesome, more confident. ^t-00-48-05

And that's why I fight like hell for truth—because it matters, right? My investment is that I have children, and my silence is essentially cowardice. That would guarantee that their future would be compromised—could be more compromised than our lives are right now. Lastly, Real Lightworker writes: "Have you looked into events going on at UVU that day? A college student posted an FB reel of her experience. She ran into a building where the room was filled with uniformed people and a bunch of different flags. Who were they?" That's the Hall of Flags that's behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s head, and I do find something suspicious was going on there. ^t-00-48-49

So, yeah. Look, we are investigating every day with more information. Tomorrow we will have more explosive information and revelations about the Egyptian plane, which... So interesting—speaking of the unique relationship between Egypt and Israel—TikTok is hitting us for videos talking about the Egyptian planes. That's very strange. Israel's moderator served in the IDF—we know—and Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi Netanyahu) wants TikTok secured for Israel's future. ^t-00-49-32

It's kind of coming together. There's a picture here that's coming together. Anyways, you guys, we have to jump off because we do have book club tonight. So I will see you guys in the Zionist infiltration on our book club. We finally did it, guys. We went viral, and they're stealing clips from behind the paywall. If you guys would like to support our work, you know, you can go to CandaceOwens.com. You can go to MakeHimASandwich.com to buy the book. You will really enjoy this book. It's really important—especially for women to understand where these feminist ideals came from. And beyond that, we will see you guys tomorrow. ^t-00-50-14
