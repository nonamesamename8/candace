Let's jump right back into it, back into the investigation because I have some incredibly interesting updates for you. Actually, some explosive revelations regarding the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> case.

And I just want to be clear here: no matter what I say throughout this episode, please remember that they are always the victim, historically have always been the victim, and they have done nothing wrong. Didn't do nothing wrong on 9/10 either. In other news, the McCoys.

Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-45"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span>. Do you know that moment when your subconscious kind of meets your conscious? Like you just suddenly—your subconscious is storing all this information and it's maybe flagging something for you that's a little weird, but you haven't come to realize it yet. And then all of a sudden, the information breaks the surface and you're like, "Aha, I got it." I didn't even realize what that thing that happened a long time ago was a little bit weird. ^t-00-00-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-01-25.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:25</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=85" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And suddenly, you're behaving like Dory, the blue fish from the movie Finding Nemo, when she remembers the P. Sherman address from <span id="ent-gpe-australia-t-00-01-25"><a href="/entities/gpe-australia.md">Australia</a></span>. You guys know that moment. Take a watch. Crime solved, okay? That is how it works. Never ignore your subconscious. That's why I say, pay attention to my dreams. I don't care who has to laugh at me about it. And there was this little something that flagged in the back of my mind as odd in the aftermath of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-25"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s assassination. ^t-00-01-25

Elle Woods in the movie Legally Blonde—she was absolutely correct when she said that people who work out have endorphins and happy people don't kill their husbands. Anyway, the thing that I realized is that <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-02-07"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>, the chief of staff of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-07"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>—<a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>—for whatever reason, he always requires an adjective. Whenever they discuss <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a><span id="event-event-2025-07-11-tucker-carlson-speech-calls-out-bill-ackman-on-isr-t-00-02-07"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-11-tucker-carlson-speech-calls-out-bill-ackman-on-isr.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, there's an adjective before they say his name. A bunch of people in the <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> orbit described <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a> in this very unique manner. I want you to take a listen to that. ^t-00-02-07

We're gonna start with 23-year-old <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-02-50"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>. And that's when the great <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a> showed up. And my husband's chief of staff, the amazing <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>. My friend <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>, the brilliant 24-year-old who at the time when <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-50"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> was shot was 23 and was a hero that day. I used to be known as <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s pastor. Now I'm known as <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>'s dad. He clicked into gear eventually. It was amazing. <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> was a heroic figure on that day. ^t-00-02-50

And objectively speaking, okay—I don't care what your experience in life is—I would not move to insist that someone was quote-unquote "heroic" for walking away from their friend after he was shot. Okay, that wouldn't be the adjective that came to my mind. Heroic. I also don't feel the need ever to qualify any of my friends with an adjective. Think about how strange it would be if on this show, every time<span id="event-event-2025-07-11-tucker-carlson-speech-calls-out-bill-ackman-on-isr-t-00-03-25"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-11-tucker-carlson-speech-calls-out-bill-ackman-on-isr.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> I cover<a href="/events/event-2025-07-11-tucker-carlson-speech-calls-out-bill-ackman-on-isr.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a> <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-03-25"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a></span>, I was like, "The spectacular <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a>, the breathtaking <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a> is under attack in this moment." ^t-00-03-25

And I wanna be super clear here: knowing y'all, though, I don't think that—I know that <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-04-10"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span> did not kill <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>.

In fact, on stage at the memorial event for <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> and elsewhere, they were trying to prime the public for that plausibility—almost like it was this psychological operation<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-12-israeli-cell-phones-detected-at-uvu-during-char-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-12-israeli-cell-phones-detected-at-uvu-during-char.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-07-18-uvu-turning-point-chapter-submits-application-for-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-18-uvu-turning-point-chapter-submits-application-for.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-08-24-rob-mccoy-lists-secondary-home-in-coronado-for-sal-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-08-24-rob-mccoy-lists-secondary-home-in-coronado-for-sal.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-07-15-rob-mccoy-transitions-to-pastor-emeritus-role-at-g-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-07-15-rob-mccoy-transitions-to-pastor-emeritus-role-at-g.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-01-01-rob-mccoy-announces-stepping-down-as-senior-pastor-t-00-04-10"><a href="/events/event-2025-01-01-rob-mccoy-announces-stepping-down-as-senior-pastor.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, nod to <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-04-10"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span> and his family lineage—to see <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> as capable of filling <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'s shoes.

That second paragraph begins, "We spent a few weeks together this summer, our first family trip together," okay? Getting real close there. And while they were on this very first time together for a couple of weeks vacation, something moved the McCoys to capture intimate and sweet moments of the Kirk family from behind the scenes. Now, you know which footage I'm talking about. It's the footage that has since gone viral of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-11-21"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> walking with his children and <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-11-21"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> grabs his hand.

Is it the extraordinarily lucky <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-12-03"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>? Because I was thinking about it because I have a big family, and people with families know.

There's always one person missing from intimate family moments when they're on the fly. They're not planned, right? There tends to be one family member missing because one person grabs the camera, and you're capturing the kids with dad or you're capturing the kids with mom or it's just the kids—whatever it is, that's how family footage when it's organic tends to look, right? ^t-00-12-03

And he similarly had some rather impeccable timing. <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-13-27"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>, as you very well know, was the senior pastor of the <span id="ent-org-godspeak-calvary-chapel-t-00-13-27"><a href="/entities/org-godspeak-calvary-chapel.md">Godspeak Calvary Chapel</a></span> in <span id="ent-gpe-thousand-oaks-california-t-00-13-27"><a href="/entities/gpe-thousand-oaks-california.md">Thousand Oaks, California</a></span>. You should also know, by the way—let me introduce this to you right now—because I didn't know that he was funded; his church was funded by the <span id="ent-person-wilks-brothers-t-00-13-27"><a href="/entities/person-wilks-brothers.md">Wilks Brothers</a></span> down in <span id="ent-gpe-texas-t-00-13-27"><a href="/entities/gpe-texas.md">Texas</a></span>.

It's like <span id="ent-concept-christians-t-00-14-10"><a href="/entities/concept-christians.md">Christians</a></span> for Jews. You look into it yourself. I honestly can't explain it, but that's just something that you should know in the background. Anyway, for whatever reason, after 17 years as the head pastor of that church, <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-14-10"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>—it was publicly announced in January of this year—that he would be stepping down as the head pastor and instead assuming the role of pastor emeritus. Now for the uninitiated, emeritus is basically just an honorific title, right? Bestowed upon someone after they retire from some distinguished position. ^t-00-14-10

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qfwr08Ebczo/t-00-14-54.md" class="timestamp-link">00:14:54</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfwr08Ebczo&t=894" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** For <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-14-54"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>, they had planned that transition. That transition took effect in <span id="ent-date-mid-july-t-00-14-54"><a href="/entities/date-mid-july.md">mid-July</a></span> of this year. <a href="/entities/date-mid-july.md">Mid-July</a> of this year is when he officially steps down from the church. A lot going on here in McCoyland. Now, in case you're thinking, "Well, that doesn't mean that he was doing all of that and transitioning because he was anticipating some bigger role at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-14-54"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> and maybe therefore planning to wind down his life in <span id="ent-gpe-california-t-00-14-54"><a href="/entities/gpe-california.md">California</a></span>," no. Actually, that's exactly the reason that was cited when it was reported on in January in the Ventura County Star. They wrote, quote, "He's approaching a transition in July. ^t-00-14-54

McCoy will become the emeritus pastor and will still preach regularly at the church in a role that could last into the mid-70s." And then it goes on to say, "When McCoy's responsibilities grew at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-15-33"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, he and his wife sold their home in <span id="ent-gpe-thousand-oaks-t-00-15-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-thousand-oaks.md">Thousand Oaks</a></span> and bought a home in the <span id="ent-gpe-phoenix-t-00-15-33"><a href="/entities/gpe-phoenix.md">Phoenix</a></span> area." Now, he said that he bought a different place in <a href="/entities/gpe-thousand-oaks.md">Thousand Oaks</a>. He also owns a home in Coronado near San Diego. Now, what we can confirm to you is that Rob actually put that secondary home in Coronado up for sale on <span id="ent-date-august-27th-t-00-15-33"><a href="/entities/date-august-27th.md">August 24th</a></span>, <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-15-33"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span>, of this year. ^t-00-15-33

I'm excited to share with you guys C15, which is from Fatty15—the first emerging essential fatty acid to be discovered in more than 90 years. It's an incredible scientific breakthrough to support our long-term health, wellness, and healthy aging. Based on over 100 studies, we now know that C15 strengthens our cells and is a key healthy aging nutrient which helps slow biological aging at the cellular level. When our cells don't have enough C15, they become fragile, and they age faster. And thankfully, Fatty15 repairs age-related damage to cells, and it protects them from future breakdown. And it activates pathways in the body that help regulate our sleep, our cognitive health, and naturally repair our repair mechanisms. ^t-00-25-55

And I wanted to make the point that I often make—and now seems even more important than it ever has—which is that virtue and sin are not transmitted genetically. There is no such thing as blood guilt. Therefore, collective punishment is always immoral. God created each person individually. He did not create communities at once—created people. And all of us will die and in the end face God alone. So it's about the person, and people can be changed by God, by the way.

And everything that's happening in our country, our culture, the corrosion—I think it's because <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-47-26"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span> has married <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-47-26"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionism</a></span>. Like, I truly do believe that. And I think a lot of people are waking up to that. We were a better country when we were a Christian nation. We are no longer a Christian nation. We are an occupied nation with an ideology that has produced filth in our culture.

Miranda writes: "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-48-05"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span>, I'm 23 and newly married. We just found out that I'm pregnant." Congratulations. "I'm nervous, but I know children are God's blessing. Do you have any advice for me as a young mother? Is it okay to be nervous?" My advice would be not to take advice. It is going to be the most natural job that you have. You are going to just know what to do when you see the baby, and it will make you a better person because you will be so tapped into God's creation. You will realize that there is something more. It is one of the sins in the culture that kind of trained us to have children later— is that we don't tap into our divine purpose, and children immediately have you tap into your divine purpose. You feel more wholesome, more confident. ^t-00-48-05

And that's why I fight like hell for truth—because it matters, right? My investment is that I have children, and my silence is essentially cowardice. That would guarantee that their future would be compromised—could be more compromised than our lives are right now.

A college student posted an FB reel of her experience. She ran into a building where the room was filled with uniformed people and a bunch of different flags. Who were they?" That's the Hall of Flags that's behind <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-48-49"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s head, and I do find something suspicious was going on there. ^t-00-48-49
