Happy Monday. <a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a> civil war—at least that's what they are trying to brand it as. They say that's what's going on. But really, we all know it's more like Never Trumpers have now infiltrated<span id="event-event-2025-11-02-randy-fine-at-republican-jewish-coalition-calls-tu-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-11-02-randy-fine-at-republican-jewish-coalition-calls-tu.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-11-02-lindsey-graham-at-republican-jewish-coalition-says-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-11-02-lindsey-graham-at-republican-jewish-coalition-says.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> the <span id="ent-concept-maga-movement-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA movement</a></span>, and they're trying to dictate the terms like we didn't notice. Randomly, Ben <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Shapiro</a></span> apparently woke up this morning and chose violence. He put me in his anti-<span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> montage monologue. We'll see what he had to say in a little bit. And it just so happens to be exactly what every <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a></span> has had to say in the last 24 to 48 hours—almost as though it's scripted. In other news, <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> sat down with Jesse <span id="ent-person-jesse-watters-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-jesse-watters.md">Watters</a></span>. Now the full interview has not yet aired, but it's already going viral. Just a preview clip of it, and we're going to discuss it. ^t-00-00-00

Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. So obviously a major theme of this podcast is that everything truly is fake and gay. And people that listen to this podcast have already accepted that. The question really is just now, how fake are we talking? What shade of gayness are we talking? And I think we should start with the Lindsey <span id="ent-person-lindsey-graham-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/person-lindsey-graham.md">Graham</a></span> shade, which he threw at American voters. ^t-00-00-46

He and many others, by the way—many other treasonous congressmen—basically directed their fire and their anger toward Americans, letting us know, basically—not even basically—literally telling us that if you do not support <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-01-30"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, a foreign nation, then you're not even allowed to be a Republican anymore. Take a listen to Lindsey <span id="ent-person-lindsey-graham-t-00-01-30"><a href="/entities/person-lindsey-graham.md">Graham</a></span> in his own words. ^t-00-01-30

It ain't the road to the Republican Party. Really great messaging, Senator. And he obviously was not the only one because we know how these things go. He was joined on stage by many others, including the very genocidal Randy <span id="ent-person-randy-fine-t-00-02-14"><a href="/entities/person-randy-fine.md">Fine</a></span>. Randy <a href="/entities/person-randy-fine.md">Fine</a>, just to be clear, he has been so disgusting in his rhetoric towards Palestinians—saying essentially that they're just not even truly humans—that even <span id="ent-org-aipac-t-00-02-14"><a href="/entities/org-aipac.md">AIPAC</a></span> had to drop him. That's saying a lot. If <a href="/entities/org-aipac.md">AIPAC</a> was like, "You went a little too far for even us." Irrespective of this, Randy <a href="/entities/person-randy-fine.md">Fine</a> decided that he, I guess, is the arbiter of the new cool kids club. ^t-00-02-14

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-02-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=178" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Like, you know, we should all want to sit with them, support <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, or you can't sit with us. Can't sit with me, Randy <span id="ent-person-randy-fine-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-randy-fine.md">Fine</a></span>, and Lindsey <span id="ent-person-lindsey-graham-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-lindsey-graham.md">Graham</a></span>. And to show us just how hip and motivated and relevant they are, they sent some poor interns—it looks like they sent some poor interns down to FedEx or Kinko's or UPS—to print out these totally organic red signs. And the signs read—I don't know how he's going to get over this— "So <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>, if you need to take a couple of days off, we get it." But the sign said, "<a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a> is not <span id="ent-concept-maga-movement-t-00-02-58"><a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a></span>." There's something about it that's so dorky. Sick burn. <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a> is not <a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a>. ^t-00-02-58

This is like when Homeboy—who was the guy?—Jussie <span id="ent-person-jussie-smollett-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/person-jussie-smollett.md">Smollett</a></span> went out and he was like, "They said to me, 'This is <a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a> country.'" And we were like, nobody in <a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a> says "this is <a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a> country." No one in <a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a> would say "<a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a></span> is not <a href="/entities/concept-maga-movement.md">MAGA</a>." It's just strange. It's a very strange thing to say. It's very dorky. And they said it—they did it. And beyond that, besides printing out these little red posters, they gave those posters to some young men. I'm sure they're very nice young men. And they instructed them to wave the posters on stage while<span id="event-event-2025-11-03-jerusalem-post-falsely-reports-erika-kirk-acceptin-t-00-03-41"><a href="/events/event-2025-11-03-jerusalem-post-falsely-reports-erika-kirk-acceptin.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> Randy <span id="ent-person-randy-fine-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/person-randy-fine.md">Fine</a></span> of all people spoke.

"You go, Randy <span id="ent-person-randy-fine-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/person-randy-fine.md">Fine</a></span>." And Randy <a href="/entities/person-randy-fine.md">Fine</a> was getting them all fired up. And he said the usual thing. <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a> is basically akin to—you're going to be shocked— you guessed it, <span id="ent-person-adolf-hitler-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/person-adolf-hitler.md">Adolf Hitler</a></span>.

I mean, he must be shaking. I'm literally shaking right now. Shaking—just shaking—listening to it. It's just over. They have declared war on <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a>, which they happen to do every week, obviously. And they all say the same thing, which shows how inorganic it is. It's like <span id="ent-concept-operation-mockingbird-t-00-05-22"><a href="/entities/concept-operation-mockingbird.md">Operation Mockingbird</a></span> pastor. And it was very clear that they were instructed to go after <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a>. More than anyone else, we know that <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-05-22"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> cannot stand <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Carlson</a>.

He's having conversations with people that they don't like. It's that simple as to why they go after him. That's also why they fired him from Fox because he was speaking out against the <span id="ent-gpe-ukraine-t-00-06-07"><a href="/entities/gpe-ukraine.md">Ukrainian</a></span> war, and that was not allowed. They thought that firing him would effectively ruin him, and he wouldn't be able to secure another big contract within the apparatus that they very much control.

You have something solid. What I do now sets a tone. If I teach my kids the value of preparing, protecting, planning, they'll carry that mindset forward. Gold is one piece of that story. I'm not saying that you should dump everything into gold. That would be as misguided as sticking with only stocks. Smart, intentional, balanced investing is what I preach in my own life.

If she was sitting down with like <a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>'<span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-27-53"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">s</a></span> entourage, I might have something to say. ^t-00-27-53

Don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure I saw that being teased. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> opened up to <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a> in the end. <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a> stood 10 toes down on telling the truth—which is why I deeply respected her for doing this—about the pressure that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was under. And it was not easy for <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a> to do that, okay? She is still catching heat for the fact that she did that. So I feel like <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> is kind of sending a message here that she's not standing against the people that are telling the truth. I said early on: if <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Kirk</a> asks me to be quiet, I will be quiet. ^t-00-28-37

So I don't know what I'm supposed to do. A show on whether I like her hair, her outfits—that doesn't feel right. And also keep in mind that is the mother of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>'<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-29-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">s</a></span> children.

And what is left of him in this world are his two small children. So to just take a baseless attack—if I catch her in a lie, it's a little different—to just take an attack on her does not feel appropriate to me. I haven't seen any reason to do that. So I'm looking forward to the sit-down with Jesse <span id="ent-person-jesse-watters-t-00-29-20"><a href="/entities/person-jesse-watters.md">Watters</a></span>.

None of this makes any sense to the public. And what I did say early on—I don't remember which episode it was— was I would not have wanted <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-31-02"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> to—it would not be my—it would not have been my advice for <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> in a stage of grieving to go from being the widow to being the CEO and the chairman of the company. If I was running the company, I would have said, "Let's put in place an interim CEO," right? Someone below <span id="ent-person-justin-strief-t-00-31-02"><a href="/entities/person-justin-strief.md">Justin Strife</a></span> (<a href="/entities/person-justin-strief.md">Justin Strife</a>)—I think was the COO.

There's a widow, and then there is the chairman and the CEO. And that person—no matter what—is going to have to catch heat for any decisions the business is making. That's just the reality of the way the world works. When you're a CEO and you're a boss, if a mistake is made—doesn't matter whether you did it, whether you said it, whether you tweeted it—it's going to come down on you. And she has assumed that role, okay? So criticisms pertaining to anything at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-31-47"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> that are being directed at <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-31-47"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> are fair. Obviously, they are fair if they are directed about <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> and their actions. The second thing that I would say—and again, this is unsolicited advice, so she's free to throw it out— ^t-00-31-47

They don't believe the story. And you are—and of course this is only a snippet of the interview, so I'm sure more will be said here—but I'm getting that you have seen the case; you think it's a solid case. She thinks it's a solid case, at least, and they're saying, "Show everybody what you have so they can see true evil." Within her capacity of chairman and CEO of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-32-27"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, they could be more transparent about what happened that day.

You know, Rob <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-33-12"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">McCoy</a></span> is lying.

The market's always right. He says it's about like trading and things of that nature—meaning irrespective of what your opinion is or what you think you know, the market is the market. So maybe the top execs at Cracker Barrel thought it was brilliant to change the marketing, and they brought in the highest-paid advertisers to do that, and they thought it was sleek and it was amazing. The people revolted. And they said, "We don't—we don't like this." "We don't trust it." "Put that old man back up there." "We want to see the cracker and the barrel out." And guess what? The market was right. That's kind of the point of the expression. The market is always right. And the market right now is saying, "We don't believe a single thing that happened that day."

If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there's no better time than now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. With rates dropping, now is the time to pay off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity that's in their home for instant savings. They're saving people just like you an average of $800 a month. And many are seeing rates in the low fives. That is a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, which will give you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before you know it. So do not wait. ^t-00-42-11

Also, as I always tell you about 7 Weeks Coffee, I'm going to do it again, you know, and it is a part of our daily routine. We drink it every morning. And honestly, I could not imagine starting the day without it. But it's not just about the great taste. The coffee stands for something that we deeply believe in here, which is it's the pro-life American coffee company on a mission to fund the pro-life movement— one cup of coffee at a time. They are called Seven Weeks. You guys know why: because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean. That's the same time that a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. ^t-00-42-55

They've now raised over $1 million, and they saved thousands of lives. And I can tell you that the coffee is fantastic.
