**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. Happy Monday. MAGA civil war—at least that's what they are trying to brand it as. They say that's what's going on. But really, we all know it's more like Never Trumpers have now infiltrated the MAGA movement, and they're trying to dictate the terms like we didn't notice. Randomly, Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) apparently woke up this morning and chose violence. He put me in his anti-Tucker (Tucker Carlson) montage monologue. We'll see what he had to say in a little bit. And it just so happens to be exactly what every Zionist has had to say in the last 24 to 48 hours—almost as though it's scripted. In other news, Erika Kirk sat down with Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters). Now the full interview has not yet aired, but it's already going viral. Just a preview clip of it, and we're going to discuss it. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=46" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-00-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And lastly, Kash Patel (Kash Patel) is now officially the most embarrassing human being in the United States. Welcome back to Candace. So obviously a major theme of this podcast is that everything truly is fake and gay. And people that listen to this podcast have already accepted that. The question really is just now, how fake are we talking? What shade of gayness are we talking? And I think we should start with the Lindsey Graham (Lindsey Graham) shade, which he threw at American voters. ^t-00-00-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=90" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-01-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So what happened was he was on stage at the Republican Jewish Coalition. He and many others, by the way—many other treasonous congressmen—basically directed their fire and their anger toward Americans, letting us know, basically—not even basically—literally telling us that if you do not support Israel, a foreign nation, then you're not even allowed to be a Republican anymore. Take a listen to Lindsey Graham (Lindsey Graham) in his own words. ^t-00-01-30

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=117" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-01-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Lindsey Graham (clip): I want the world to know anti-Semitism, anti-Israel rhetoric, anti-Israel thought is not the road to being elected as a Republican. Lindsey Graham (clip): You will lose. Lindsey Graham (clip): You can't even have an anti-Israel thought. ^t-00-01-57

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=134" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-02-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So if you're thinking like, I don't know, killing tens of thousands of children is not good— well, guess what? It ain't the road to the Republican Party. Really great messaging, Senator. And he obviously was not the only one because we know how these things go. He was joined on stage by many others, including the very genocidal Randy Fine (Randy Fine). Randy Fine (Randy Fine), just to be clear, he has been so disgusting in his rhetoric towards Palestinians—saying essentially that they're just not even truly humans—that even AIPAC had to drop him. That's saying a lot. If AIPAC was like, "You went a little too far for even us." Irrespective of this, Randy Fine (Randy Fine) decided that he, I guess, is the arbiter of the new cool kids club. ^t-00-02-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=178" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-02-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Like, you know, we should all want to sit with them, support Israel, or you can't sit with us. Can't sit with me, Randy Fine (Randy Fine), and Lindsey Graham (Lindsey Graham). And to show us just how hip and motivated and relevant they are, they sent some poor interns—it looks like they sent some poor interns down to FedEx or Kinko's or UPS—to print out these totally organic red signs. And the signs read—I don't know how he's going to get over this— "So Tucker (Tucker Carlson), if you need to take a couple of days off, we get it." But the sign said, "Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA." There's something about it that's so dorky. Sick burn. Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA. ^t-00-02-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=221" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-03-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And it sounds so inauthentic that you know it didn't come from anybody that was originally MAGA. This is like when Homeboy—who was the guy?—Jussie Smollett (Jussie Smollett) went out and he was like, "They said to me, 'This is MAGA country.'" And we were like, nobody in MAGA says "this is MAGA country." No one in MAGA would say "Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA." It's just strange. It's a very strange thing to say. It's very dorky. And they said it—they did it. And beyond that, besides printing out these little red posters, they gave those posters to some young men. I'm sure they're very nice young men. And they instructed them to wave the posters on stage while Randy Fine (Randy Fine) of all people spoke. Like he was the Spice Girls going back on stage. ^t-00-03-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=264" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-04-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA." "You go, Randy Fine (Randy Fine)." And Randy Fine (Randy Fine) was getting them all fired up. And he said the usual thing. Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is basically akin to—you're going to be shocked— you guessed it, Adolf Hitler. So original. Take it away, Randy Fine (Randy Fine). ^t-00-04-24

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=285" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-04-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** Randy Fine (clip): But make no mistake. Randy Fine (clip): Today, Randy Fine (clip): Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is the most dangerous anti-Semite in America. Randy Fine (clip): He has chosen to take on the mantle of leader of a modern-day Hitler youth, to broadcast and feature those who celebrate the Nazis, those who call for the extermination of Israel, to defend Hamas, to even criticize President Trump (Donald Trump) for stopping Iran's nuclear ambitions. Randy Fine (clip): Friends, make no mistake. Randy Fine (clip): Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA. ^t-00-04-45

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=322" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-05-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It is so over for Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson). I mean, he must be shaking. I'm literally shaking right now. Shaking—just shaking—listening to it. It's just over. They have declared war on Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson), which they happen to do every week, obviously. And they all say the same thing, which shows how inorganic it is. It's like Operation Mockingbird pastor. And it was very clear that they were instructed to go after Tucker (Tucker Carlson). More than anyone else, we know that Zionists cannot stand Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson). And the real reason that they hate him is because he's very well liked now by both sides. And he also happens to not be controlled. ^t-00-05-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=367" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-06-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** You can always tell who they control because they don't condemn them even when they, like Randy Fine (Randy Fine), just come right out with genocidal language against the Palestinians— referring to them as subhuman, laughing when he sees a dead body of a Palestinian. They don't care. They support it. They cover it up. But Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson)? Oh, no. He's having conversations with people that they don't like. It's that simple as to why they go after him. That's also why they fired him from Fox because he was speaking out against the Ukrainian war, and that was not allowed. They thought that firing him would effectively ruin him, and he wouldn't be able to secure another big contract within the apparatus that they very much control. And it turns out Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) actually got even bigger, and he became even more well-liked, and they want justice for that. ^t-00-06-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=409" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-06-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And the way that they are going about it right now though is especially sickening. They're now trying to roll Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk) legacy into this. We all know—as I proved—that these same individuals were squeezing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) leading up to the end of his life. They wanted—again—Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) to be gone, no longer allowed on the Turning Point USA stage because Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is the natural heir to the populist movement. And they want him to be canceled. Only people that they control are allowed to be in positions of power. So recently, Tucker (Tucker Carlson) interviewed Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). ^t-00-06-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=452" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-07-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The reason he did that, I've heard, is because it happens to be a free country, and it's his platform, and he can speak to whoever the hell he wants in the world. But of course with Zionists—the very same ones who were causing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) all of that grief in the final days and hours leading up to his assassination, the very same ones that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) thought were going to kill him—they've now decided to besmirch Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) name by asserting that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) interviewing Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) is a betrayal to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). He's no longer Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) friend. They've decided posthumously that Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) was a bad friend to Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). And do you know who can actually debunk that pretty easily? Yours truly. ^t-00-07-32

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=496" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-08-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I got you guys, okay? And it's just a little bit of common sense. Before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died—really kind of just before he died in July—I interviewed Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I discussed the interview, and never once did he tell me not to speak to Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). Never once did he consider it an act of betrayal. To the contrary, I had a very long discussion with him. I also had a long discussion with Andrew Colvet (Andrew Colvet) separately, telling them both that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) should host Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) on his show and debate him. I tried to make that happen. You guys will recall this. Andrew Colvet (Andrew Colvet) can confirm that everything that I am saying is true. Oh, it's such an act of betrayal to speak to Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). Never at any point did Charlie (Charlie Kirk) say, "Don't do that." Because that's ridiculous. It's not who he was. ^t-00-08-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=541" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-09-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But the truth, obviously, is never what Zionists are concerned with. They want Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) legacy by any means necessary. They want people to believe that his legacy belongs to Israel somehow. And the harder that they work to lie about his legacy, the more the world wakes up to the truth about it. They are waking up to the truth about how Charlie (Charlie Kirk) really felt. It's just becoming too obvious. Anyway, let's get to Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro), okay? Because on his show today, he took a very—dare I say—scripted stab at Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson). Same talking points. "Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) has betrayed Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) by hosting Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes)." And for absolutely no reason at all, I caught a stray bullet, which tends to happen. For whatever reason, they get mad at Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson). They attack me. ^t-00-09-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=586" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-09-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** They get mad at me. They kind of punch Megyn Kelly (Megyn Kelly) now. I don't know what Megyn Kelly (Megyn Kelly) has done wrong, but she's done wrong, is what they say. And he obviously listened to what he has to say. This is Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) straight from a teleprompter. ^t-00-09-46

Ben Shapiro (clip): And here is where his relationship with Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) begins, with Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) correctly pointing out that Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is a coward. Ben Shapiro (clip): You see, Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) a few weeks back had on Candace (Candace Owens) to treat her to his usual ideological laundering services. Ben Shapiro (clip): That's after years of Candace Owens (Candace Owens) saying things like this. ^t-00-09-57

**🎤 SPEAKER_5**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=616" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-10-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_5:** Candace Owens (clip): And it is the case that dinosaur bones, for whatever reason, are always just found by the paleontologist. Candace Owens (clip): It's not like you and me walking outside. Candace Owens (clip): I'm like, "Hey, a dinosaur bone." Candace Owens (clip): Or by somebody who's related to a paleontologist. Candace Owens (clip): It's very strange. Candace Owens (clip): And then, but it was just convenient for Israel that JFK got shot. Candace Owens (clip): It was just convenient, you guys. Candace Owens (clip): Totally convenient. Candace Owens (clip): It was convenient for Israel, by the way, when the towers went down. Candace Owens (clip): I just want to be clear. Candace Owens (clip): Anything happens to me, blame the Zionists. Candace Owens (clip): Like, 1000% blame the Zionists. Candace Owens (clip): Like, let that be my parting word. Candace Owens (clip): I'm waking people up to the fact that pedophiles are in power. Candace Owens (clip): They are literally in power. Candace Owens (clip): And that is intentional because then they can be controlled while they are in power. ^t-00-10-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=658" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-10-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_5:** Candace Owens (clip): And they are also exhibiting signs of a psychopathology that lets them know that they will do harm to the masses and feel nothing because they were themselves—many of them—raped when they were children. Candace Owens (clip): It's not a coincidence that Justin Trudeau (Justin Trudeau) is gay. Candace Owens (clip): Obama, gay. Candace Owens (clip): Zelensky (Zelensky), gay. Candace Owens (clip): Emmanuel Macron (Emmanuel Macron), gay and married to a trans man who molested him when he was a child. Candace Owens (clip): I mean, fact check—all true. ^t-00-10-58

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=688" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-11-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I take nothing back. But you catch the vibe here. The vibe here is that Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is criminally laundering ideas through his beyond-the-pale guest, and Ben (Ben Shapiro) is using the preferred strategy of out-of-context clips to paint a picture of my perspectives, which... I stand by. Yeah, dinosaur bones are, by and large, always found by the experts. You can look that up yourself. And yes, if I wind up dead in mysterious circumstances, you should obviously assume it was orchestrated by Zionists—duh. In lengthier clips, which he didn't show, I've asserted that this entire American culture—which has grown quite perverse— it's a culture of vices that we are suffering from today: a culture that is filled with pornography, gambling, transgenderism, radical feminism, modern psychology, pharmaceuticals. ^t-00-11-28

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=727" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-12-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** If you research these topics historically, you will recognize that they were brought to and fought for on our shores by people like Emma Goldman (Emma Goldman) on feminism, Sigmund Freud (Sigmund Freud), the father of modern psychology. The gambling empire is where the Adelson empire wealth comes from, as are many pharmaceuticals like the Sackler family (Sackler family). These people have their names on buildings in Tel Aviv. The owners of Purdue Pharma, the architects of the opioid epidemic. Pornography! ^t-00-12-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=772" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-12-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Our boy Al Goldstein (Al Goldstein) took happy credit for that, right? He's the one who notoriously said the only reason that Jews are in pornography is that we think Christ sucks, Catholicism sucks—we don't believe in authoritarianism. Pornography becomes a way of defiling Christian culture as it penetrates to the very heart of the American mainstream. By the way, Al Goldstein (Al Goldstein) was right—that actually has happened. And pornography, if you're wondering, is somehow considered—how it became somehow considered—free speech. That's because Jewish individuals in America fought for that. Samuel Roth (Samuel Roth)—actually, that's his name—fought for that decision in court. Transgenderism—go back and try to figure out where that came from. Magnus Hirschfeld (Magnus Hirschfeld) was the doctor and the sexologist. ^t-00-12-52

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=815" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-13-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So these are the facts, and the facts don't really care about your feelings. So please keep me in context. There's a lot people can learn from me. All that aside, I have to say that I was quite stunned that he found within himself—Ben (Ben Shapiro)—the audacity to present this attack on Tucker (Tucker Carlson) as a noble defense of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Here's what Ben (Ben Shapiro) said in his own words. There's no question that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) has become the most virulent superspreader of vile ideas in America. And the rest of us who oppose those vile ideas have every right to call him that. There is one other element here that's even darker, if possible. Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) preys on the friendship he proclaims with others, and then he knifes them directly between the shoulder blades when convenient for him. ^t-00-13-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=856" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-14-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is, in short, a terrible friend. Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) was supposedly Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk) friend. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) believed that Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) was vermin. That's a direct quote. He believed that because Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) dedicated his life to destroying Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) and TPUSA from the inside. So first and foremost, the idea that in order for you to show that you're a good friend of somebody, you have to agree not to host people on your platform from conversations is just so anti-Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—it's unbelievable. It's just disrespectful, really, to his legacy. And it is simply a fact—which I feel comfortable sharing now—that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) did not get along. ^t-00-14-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=896" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-14-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) found out that Ben (Ben Shapiro) was operating behind the scenes to stop him and sort of hinder the growth of Turning Point USA in our early days—right when things—when we were kind of coming up together, or me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) as partners getting out there—and I have only about 80 to 150 text messages from Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to that effect. This is not a debate, by the way. This is a fact. So challenge me to share the messages. I will gladly. Now, when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) tried to figure out where the sudden hostility was coming from—because he at first admired Ben (Ben Shapiro), like I admired Ben (Ben Shapiro)—actually Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was the one that told me, "You should watch Ben (Ben Shapiro) debate videos so you can strengthen your debate skills." The next thing we knew, we were hearing that he was trying to block us. ^t-00-14-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=941" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-15-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And they had a conversation, and Ben (Ben Shapiro) told Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—again, this is according to my messages with Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—that Ben (Ben Shapiro) was in part upset because I made a joke about him: a literal lighthearted joke when I appeared on Joe Rogan (Joe Rogan) back in 2018. Do we have that clip, Skylar (Skylar)? ^t-00-15-41

(Candace Owens (Candace Owens) on Joe Rogan (Joe Rogan) clip): Candace Owens (clip): Like, I can't take anything seriously anymore. Candace Owens (clip): Well, there's things to be taken seriously, but celebrities probably are on that list. Candace Owens (clip): Yeah, so Ben Shapiro's (Ben Shapiro) right. Candace Owens (clip): Yeah, no. Well, he's right about this, you know. But he was like trying to correlate like what Kim did like with Alice Marie Johnson (Alice Marie Johnson) was like that, and I'm like, "Come on, man. That's like totally different." And just in general like sometimes he just gets a little like hall monitor for me. Like, you know, like it's just like, you know, he can't help himself. Candace Owens (clip): I know he's a funny guy. Candace Owens (clip): Yeah, it's very snarky. I like him a lot. Candace Owens (clip): I like him too. Candace Owens (clip): That's the thing. Candace Owens (clip): We actually really get along, but the hall monitor—I know these types in school. Candace Owens (clip): I was in their classes. Candace Owens (clip): They're just late to school. Candace Owens (clip): The last person you want to see is the hall monitor. Candace Owens (clip): The idea that she would be late. ^t-00-16-01

But specifically Ben (Ben Shapiro) said to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) that he was upset about that and that I, Candace (Candace Owens), was going to Milo (Milo) my career if Charlie (Charlie Kirk) didn't get away from me. Now, obviously, the story goes, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) stuck with me despite Ben's (Ben Shapiro) urging. We kept climbing. We reached a point where as a team, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I were suddenly undeniable. Some producer in June of 2018 then reached out to us to book us on Ben's (Ben Shapiro) show. And honestly, I'm so glad they did this because in retrospect, it's actually one of my favorite Charlie (Charlie Kirk) memories— because it just makes me smile to reflect on because Charlie (Charlie Kirk), he was never mean-spirited. He always was just funny. He always chose humor—lighthearted humor—to get over any situation. He was never a person that wielded and dealt behind the scenes to prevent other people from becoming successful. ^t-00-16-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1tFD7FfoCU&t=1060" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU/t-00-17-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It just wasn't in him, right? He wasn't vengeful. Vengeance is actually kind of the vice that I've had to work on a lot. But Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) perspective was just laugh and move on. Anyway, the story goes, we get the invite to be on Ben Shapiro's (Ben Shapiro) show. And I'm like, "No, F that. He was so awful to us." "He said this about me miloing my career." "We should not do his show." "Why would we do his show?" And Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) like, "No, it's great." "Let's do it because we won." "OK, we won, Candace (Candace Owens)." And I'm like, "OK, fine." We get to the location. I think it was in Sherman Oaks, California at that time. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) says to me—we're in the green room— "Hey, will we take a photo with him?" "I'm going to puff my chest out and stand extra tall." ^t-00-17-40

And he actually does it. And it was completely hilarious. And this is actually the photo from that. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did that totally on purpose. That was such a Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) thing to do. And it became like our perfect inside joke every time we felt like he was kind of saying little things about us. And that was Charlie (Charlie Kirk). That was just the spirit of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And he moved on from it. He was always cordial beyond that. He never felt any nastiness. The point of me sharing this though is to make it very clear that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) loved Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I can go through all my messages with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and he loved Tucker (Tucker Carlson). Not for a single second did he not admire and respect and greatly appreciate Tucker (Tucker Carlson), and he fought for Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to be on the Turning Point stage until his dying day—literally. ^t-00-18-23

He didn't hate Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro). He just, I would say, experienced Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro). We all get the Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) experience at some point. Despite this, he always—as I said—kept it cordial because that's who he was as a person. But what I will not allow is this absolute inversion of reality where Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) becomes any sort of voice on who is and who is not betraying their friendship with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I will not allow it. Like I said, everybody has a vice. And when I reflect on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk), it is probably that he associated success and growth with money. And I believe that that is probably the conduit for the snakes that got into his company, got into the donor base—whatever it is. ^t-00-19-06

I don't care about money. I would gladly—as you have seen me do—burn it all to the ground to get out one modicum of truth. And if you'd like to hear something else that happens to be true, in the immediate aftermath of Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) death, people that were extremely close to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—including donors—were very touched by a monologue that Matt Walsh (Matt Walsh) did over on the Daily Wire. I didn't see it. I was too aggrieved to watch anything, but apparently Matt Walsh (Matt Walsh) did an amazing monologue. So the team reached out to host Matt Walsh (Matt Walsh)—to ask Matt Walsh (Matt Walsh), rather— ^t-00-19-50

And they were told that that was not allowed to happen unless Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) was also invited. And in the true spirit of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), Turning Point cordially accepted those posthumous terms. Anyways, those are the facts. Turning my attention to another matter: Israel is rather obsessed with this already failed operation to stage a hostile takeover of the legacy of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk)—so obsessed that the Jerusalem Post completely fictionalized or rather published a completely deranged lie about Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk). Here is the statement that was issued by the Israeli War Room account over on Twitter, and they were citing the actual reporting from the Jerusalem Post, which was written by journalist Michael Starr (Michael Starr). ^t-00-20-31

Michael Starr (Michael Starr) reports, "Mrs. Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk) will accept the award on her husband's behalf, a moving tribute to a man who inspired millions to stand with Israel when it mattered most." The Pillars of Jerusalem Award—inspired by the verse teaching that the world stands upon justice, truth, and peace—will also be presented by Douglas Murray (Douglas Murray), Yael Eckstein (Yael Eckstein), and Dr. Juergen Buehler (Dr. Juergen Buehler). ^t-00-21-15

I was like, "This is actually insane if this is true." "Steadfast support of Israel"—this is just a lie, and you know how I feel about lies. Fortunately, Andrew Colvet (Andrew Colvet), the spokesperson for Turning Point USA, instantly came out and slapped down the rumor. Andrew Colvet (Andrew Colvet) wrote this: "This is the first we're hearing of this." "We've reached out to the reporter at the Jerusalem Post for a correction." How do you just say "Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk) is going to accept this award on behalf of her husband because of his steadfast support for Israel"? That's not like a casual error, is it? ^t-00-21-54

And here is what he had to say. Michael Starr (Michael Starr) said this on X. He said, and he is calling that wavering. I'm calling that "Israel gaslight." They just lie. They tell audacious lies. And when they get caught, they then gaslight and pretend that they didn't get caught with their hands in the cookie jar, right? And it's just getting ridiculous. It is so ridiculous to watch them continue to lie about where Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was at in his mind at the end of his life. ^t-00-22-39

The people don't believe you. It doesn't matter how much money you spend, how many talking heads you send out to pretend that he didn't waver in his support. He did. He did. We've been reading Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in his own words, okay? Like, you can't undo this. It's lost. Yes, he supported Israel throughout his entire career. And then he felt the Agent Smiths coming in, pressing him and pushing him—ironically over Tucker (Tucker Carlson). And it really shows that you have no shame to do it again—to do it again posthumously—to say "Tucker (Tucker Carlson) must never speak on a Turning Point stage." ^t-00-23-22

I think that's just—that's ridiculous, and it's shameless. And I guess before we take a bit of a break here, I wanna say that there is going to be a day when we all get to puff our chests out, stand tall, and recognize that we—the American people—triumphed over the Israel lobby. That's all I'm gonna say about that. We'll be right back. All right, you guys—jumping in here to tell you about GoldCo because what are you doing today to protect your tomorrow? ^t-00-23-58

We're already living in the later. You probably recognize that by now. You should consider adding gold into your financial strategy. And I can tell you why. Because when economies wobble, currencies lose value, and markets can get scared, gold doesn't always follow suit, though. Having some gold means that you are not 100% dependent on just one system. You have something solid. What I do now sets a tone. If I teach my kids the value of preparing, protecting, planning, they'll carry that mindset forward. Gold is one piece of that story. I'm not saying that you should dump everything into gold. That would be as misguided as sticking with only stocks. Smart, intentional, balanced investing is what I preach in my own life. But if you're saying, "Candace (Candace Owens), I'm worried about retirement. I'm worried about the economy. I'm worried about kicking myself later," then this is your nudge. ^t-00-24-39

So many people have been writing into us, sending us emails—people that are paying in super chats—asking me to address Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk). And I guess my question back would be: what—what is there for me to address? She hasn't sat down for a long interview. All we have seen from Erika (Erika Kirk) has been the speech at the memorial event for Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-26-44

That was my reason for going after Alex Clark (Alex Clark). She lied about the Catholic thing. That was my reason for going after Andrew Colvet (Andrew Colvet), Mikey McCoy (Mikey McCoy). ^t-00-27-09

What lie has Erika (Erika Kirk) told that I'm supposed to be focused on, okay? Has she said something about—did she come out and say, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never had an issue with Israel in the end"? "He loved Israel to his dying breath"? She hasn't done that. She simply hasn't done that. What we have around the corner is a big interview that's going to be dropping this week. Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk) sat down with Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters). And I can tell you, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) loved Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters). Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters) gave us the most play time on Fox News back in the beginning. That was the big show that we got to book. And so it's a good fit. It's a fitting program for her to go on to. If she was sitting down with like Benjamin Netanyahu's (Benjamin Netanyahu) entourage, I might have something to say. ^t-00-27-53

Erika (Erika Kirk) is also—I think—slated to join Megyn Kelly (Megyn Kelly) on tour. Don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure I saw that being teased. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) opened up to Megyn (Megyn Kelly) in the end. Megyn (Megyn Kelly) stood 10 toes down on telling the truth—which is why I deeply respected her for doing this—about the pressure that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was under. And it was not easy for Megyn (Megyn Kelly) to do that, okay? She is still catching heat for the fact that she did that. So I feel like Erika (Erika Kirk) is kind of sending a message here that she's not standing against the people that are telling the truth. I said early on: if Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk) asks me to be quiet, I will be quiet. ^t-00-28-37

So I don't know what I'm supposed to do. A show on whether I like her hair, her outfits—that doesn't feel right. And also keep in mind that is the mother of Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk) children. I had a real relationship with Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), a real friendship with Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). And what is left of him in this world are his two small children. So to just take a baseless attack—if I catch her in a lie, it's a little different—to just take an attack on her does not feel appropriate to me. I haven't seen any reason to do that. So I'm looking forward to the sit-down with Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters). I think we're going to get a lot more from Erika (Erika Kirk), and we're going to see where her mindset is. ^t-00-29-20

None of this makes any sense to the public. And what I did say early on—I don't remember which episode it was— was I would not have wanted Erika (Erika Kirk) to—it would not be my—it would not have been my advice for Erika (Erika Kirk) in a stage of grieving to go from being the widow to being the CEO and the chairman of the company. If I was running the company, I would have said, "Let's put in place an interim CEO," right? Someone below Justin Strife (Justin Strife)—I think was the COO. I would have put in an interim CEO and allowed people to figure things out ^t-00-31-02

There's a widow, and then there is the chairman and the CEO. And that person—no matter what—is going to have to catch heat for any decisions the business is making. That's just the reality of the way the world works. When you're a CEO and you're a boss, if a mistake is made—doesn't matter whether you did it, whether you said it, whether you tweeted it—it's going to come down on you. And she has assumed that role, okay? So criticisms pertaining to anything at Turning Point USA that are being directed at Erika (Erika Kirk) are fair. Obviously, they are fair if they are directed about Turning Point USA and their actions. The second thing that I would say—and again, this is unsolicited advice, so she's free to throw it out— ^t-00-31-47

They don't believe the story. And you are—and of course this is only a snippet of the interview, so I'm sure more will be said here—but I'm getting that you have seen the case; you think it's a solid case. She thinks it's a solid case, at least, and they're saying, "Show everybody what you have so they can see true evil." Within her capacity of chairman and CEO of Turning Point USA, they could be more transparent about what happened that day. People don't like the stuff that they've seen about Mikey McCoy (Mikey McCoy). They don't like what they've seen about Rob McCoy (Rob McCoy). They don't like the history of Rob McCoy (Rob McCoy) and Mikey McCoy (Mikey McCoy) and their involvement here. They don't like the video of Terrell (Terrell). ^t-00-32-27

You know, Rob McCoy (Rob McCoy) is lying. In the areas that you can control the transparency, I think doing that would be beneficial to Turning Point USA because I don't think Turning Point USA is going to survive if they continue down this path of, you know, Tyler Boyer (Tyler Boyer) late-night tweeting at donors as he did over the weekend. I think he directed his fire at like John Mappin (John Mappin), and Arena Mappin (Arena Mappin) called John Mappin (John Mappin) a loser. I don't think that that's the correct messaging to come out of Turning Point USA. And there is something that my husband always says to me, and I don't know if he got it from somebody else. He probably did. ^t-00-33-12

The market's always right. He says it's about like trading and things of that nature—meaning irrespective of what your opinion is or what you think you know, the market is the market. So maybe the top execs at Cracker Barrel thought it was brilliant to change the marketing, and they brought in the highest-paid advertisers to do that, and they thought it was sleek and it was amazing. The people revolted. And they said, "We don't—we don't like this." "We don't trust it." "Put that old man back up there." "We want to see the cracker and the barrel out." And guess what? The market was right. That's kind of the point of the expression. The market is always right. And the market right now is saying, "We don't believe a single thing that happened that day." "We do not trust the donors at Turning Point USA." ^t-00-33-56

"Um, we want Turning Point to hit hard." "The people that are lying." "Why are we getting this dance around the Catholic topic, which again did not come from Erika (Erika Kirk)?" Okay. It did not come from Erika (Erika Kirk). And I would imagine there are a lot of people that are speaking in your ear. That's what it means to wake up one day and be the chairman and CEO of a major company. But people are gonna need clarity on these matters because it doesn't feel like those snakes are out of the garden. That's what it doesn't feel like, I would say. And so, yeah, I would say in every aspect that you can be transparent—which doesn't involve the feds—I would do that. ^t-00-34-40

I will certainly be watching now. Speaking of a lack of transparency, I am everyone right now when I say that Kash Patel (Kash Patel) is the most embarrassing human in the United States. Embarrassing for two reasons. One, Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was a big supporter of Kash Patel (Kash Patel), had him on his show, really pushed for him to get the role that he is in—director of the FBI—and he has just been terrible in this case. He just has been objectively, okay? ^t-00-35-20

And I didn't think he could make matters worse than over the weekend. Really guys, we are just not a serious nation. That's what I want you to know. After this tweet, I realized we are not a serious nation, and the empire is in its decline. I actually think I wanna be Russian right now after what Kash Patel (Kash Patel) tweeted. Kash Patel (Kash Patel) made me wanna be Russian like tomorrow. ^t-00-35-50

Because at least he's like a serious person, right? And Kash Patel (Kash Patel) is no longer serious. So the backstory is Kash Patel (Kash Patel)— he had a marriage breakup. He starts dating this cute little thing, Alexis (Alexis). She's very cute—very pretty girl. Makes videos online. And I don't know. I guess he flew down in his FBI plane to go see her down in Nashville. People found out that he went to go see her down in Nashville. The internet revolted and said this is an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds. Now it turns out that ^t-00-36-34

And now he's funding his personal trip to go see his girlfriend, Alexis (Alexis). So the internet didn't like the hypocrisy. The internet was correct. The market is always right. Okay. The internet was absolutely correct about this. And what Kash Patel (Kash Patel) did was he wrote this like Andy Cohen (Andy Cohen) hosting the Real Housewives of DC or something type tweet where he defends his girlfriend. ^t-00-37-08

But seriously, she's young. She's very young. And this is what he wrote. I'm just gonna read it because it's so embarrassing that we have to read it. And then I'm gonna get a passport to Russia. Okay? Here is the tweet. This is from the director of the FBI, people. Buckle up. America's so serious. We're big and we're bad. Ready? (Kash Patel (Kash Patel) tweet): I am proud of the work of this FBI. We're taking violent criminals off the streets in record numbers, crushing the fentanyl crisis, dismantling cartels, saving children, hunting down terrorists, and so much more. Let me be clear: we will not be distracted by baseless rumors or the noise from uninformed internet anarchists and the fake news. ^t-00-37-52

The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis (Alexis)—a true patriot and the woman I'm proud to call my partner in life—are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in 10 lifetimes. I'm so blessed—sorry, pull that back up. I gotta finish. I'm so blessed that she's in my life. Attacking her isn't just wrong—it's cowardly, and it jeopardizes our safety. My love of family will always be my cornerstone, and you will never tear that down or keep me from them. ^t-00-38-33

Okay, it's like a lot, and I love that Twitter hit him immediately. They hit him with a little fact check. People are not attacking Kash Patel's (Kash Patel) significant other but rather reacting to his firing of people who point out his usage of government funds to travel to her shows. Now, objectively, this is embarrassing. Objectively, Alexis (Alexis)—she seems like she's a really sweet girl. She is not a country music sensation. It's sweet that you call your girlfriend that, okay? She's just not a country music sensation. It's ridiculous. It's like me talking to my daughter. Like I do tell her she's a sensation. She's everything. She does is sensational. ^t-00-39-19

It's ridiculous. This entire tweet—I just went, "Not every thought you have in your head needs to be sent." This does not make you look masculine. It does not make you look like somebody you should be taking seriously. There was no question that Vladimir Putin (Vladimir Putin) and the homies laughed. They did—without question. They're on a group chat right now. [laughter] She makes commentary on the internet, okay? Fair game. If you're gonna weigh into politics, then you have to be able to deal with some pushback. Whatever they were saying about her, Kash (Kash Patel), okay? He's only been dating her, by the way, for like a year and a half. ^t-00-40-01

And we're talking about—just to remind you in case you're just tuning in—we are talking about the director of the FBI, and we are supposed to take away from this that we should have faith that he is emotionally stable enough that he has steeled himself for this investigation into Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk) murder. Like we are supposed to believe this is not a crash out. Man, I wish she had said to you, "Don't send that, honey." "Honey baby, don't send that, honey." "I wouldn't send that, honey baby." That does not—it may be you feel masculine doing it, but when you send it, it lets people know that America is weak. Like you need to be very reprimanded for this tweet. Could you imagine Vladimir Putin (Vladimir Putin) sending this tweet? ^t-00-40-46

Immediately they would be fired. And that's why I would like to—again—plead with you guys to consider when I run in the future for dictator of the United States to consider how I will deal with this immediately. I will sentence him to a month of hard labor. Obviously, that's the only correct response to Kash Patel (Kash Patel) writing this like "I don't like these mean girls" tweet. It's ridiculous. We are not serious people. The empire is in decline. So figure out where you're going to live because I'm between Namibia and Russia. That's it.

If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there's no better time than now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. With rates dropping, now is the time to pay off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity that's in their home for instant savings. They're saving people just like you an average of $800 a month. And many are seeing rates in the low fives. That is a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, which will give you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before you know it. So do not wait. ^t-00-42-11

Also, as I always tell you about 7 Weeks Coffee, I'm going to do it again, you know, and it is a part of our daily routine. We drink it every morning. And honestly, I could not imagine starting the day without it. But it's not just about the great taste. The coffee stands for something that we deeply believe in here, which is it's the pro-life American coffee company on a mission to fund the pro-life movement— one cup of coffee at a time. They are called Seven Weeks. You guys know why: because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean. That's the same time that a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. ^t-00-42-55

They've now raised over $1 million, and they saved thousands of lives. And I can tell you that the coffee is fantastic. It's mold-free, pesticide-free, shade-grown, low acid, and it's organically farmed. It truly checks all the boxes. So head to 7weekscoffee.com, and you'll save 15% forever when you subscribe, plus you'll get a free gift with your order. And exclusively for my listeners, if you use code Candace at checkout, you'll get an extra 10% off your first order. So that's a total of 25% total savings on your first order and a free gift.

"My son's middle name is Charlie (Charlie)." "He is nine, and you have helped make his name even stronger." "You are an inspiration." "God bless you and your family." Michael (Michael) writes that from Australia. Thank you, Michael (Michael). I love that what I say has reached Australia. I wish that I was not banned from Australia, but you know me—I'm a super bad criminal, bad to the bone. I won't worship Israel. Stacey Massey (Stacey Massey) writes: "So many trolls in the chat, yet by being here they are supporting Go Candace." Yeah, there's so many bots in the chat. I'm sorry that you guys have to go through that. We could actually put a timer so they can only post every 30 seconds. Maybe we'll do that going forward. Gmon (Gmon) writes: "You are a shining light in the dark world." "We love you and are behind you." "Don't give up or back down." I'm not giving up or backing down. ^t-00-44-24

Truly—like if you wanted a political foe, this was the way to do it. And what's so funny is I've said in so many rooms like most people consider me as a formidable enemy, but I'm a much more formidable friend. And I'm going to continue to be a formidable friend to Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). And the best way that I can do that is just telling the truth. No matter what the truth is, I can just share the truth. And that's the amazingness is like we just constantly texted all the time. And as I said, I have no reason to lie. Is it Turning Point USA has access to all his messages? ^t-00-45-06

And I—the truth is enough. The truth is always enough. Tom Paul (Tom Paul) writes: "Tyler Robinson's (Tyler Robinson) ACT score was 34, so he was in the 99 percentile." "Thomas Matthew Crooks' (Thomas Matthew Crooks) SAT score was in the 99 percentile." "Both recent lone shooters scored in the 99 percentile on standardized testing." "Not a coincidence—as if it is out of the same playbook." Something I want to say about that—something actually that I would like to reiterate about that—because I believe that is the reason for standardized testing: is that it flags for the government people that could be a problem down the line. It's kind of a repeat story in a lot of these mass shootings. I think also the one that was in—and I can't think of the guy's name—but it was in Connecticut: similar story. ^t-00-45-48

I think it's Adam Lanza (Adam Lanza), so I'm thinking of— so there's a theme here, and my opinion on that is not something that can be discussed on YouTube. So I'll save it for my book club tomorrow. Peddle (Peddle) writes: "Love you, Candace (Candace Owens)." "Please claim." Oh, people claim you don't have a degree, but I've heard you say you do. Please set the record straight. Yeah. Uh, the— truth is that I grew up poor. I was the third of a family with four children. The mom didn't even graduate high school, actually. And my family didn't have the money to send me to college. So I took out a ton of loans—student loans, Sallie Mae loans. ^t-00-46-33

So I dropped out temporarily. And then I—when I had my own money and paid off my student loans—which was something like $150,000 in student loans, which is absurd to me, such a predatory system— you're literally preying on poor people. Disgusting. That's what college is all about. Once I paid down my student loans, I re-enrolled to finish my last year. And so I have two degrees, actually. What else do we have here?

Yeah, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) believed in free speech. He didn't even blink when I hosted Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). What an absurd idea that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have—if Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ever messaged me and said, "You're betraying me by speaking to this person." I wouldn't have been friends with him. That's the reality. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was so cool. And that's why I hate that they're trying to make him like a dork in the afterlife. I don't say a dork as in someone that's like well-researched and knows the facts. I mean somebody that is so lame that they cannot beat you in the free market. So they're trying to arbitrarily force you out—as they are doing to Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson)—because you're so—you're bigger than them. ^t-00-48-01

They're annoying. People don't like them anymore. It's not cool to say "don't have a conversation." It's not cool to hold up like some donor-printed signs and do a dance in front of Randy Fine (Randy Fine). "Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA." People can see which way the wind is blowing, and it's against Israel because everything they do is uncool—and it also happens to be genocidal. So that doesn't help either. Anyways, you guys—tomorrow we have the book club. First time ever the book club was infiltrated. I'm proud of us. Very proud of us—people on the book club. So be sure to be there. ^t-00-48-38

If you want to buy that, go to makehimasandwich.com. You guys are gonna love this book because it truly is very true, and it's very funny, and it's the things that I have gone through—obviously as a woman and kind of waking up to the reality of where that feminist movement came from: Emma Goldman (Emma Goldman)—speaking of "Beyond the Pale"—that will make sense. That's one of the names of the chapter: "Beyond the Pale." And you will know more about where all of these bad ideas happen to come from. Anyways, you guys, that was a fun Monday. Tomorrow we're going to jump back into the timeline because I've got some amazing little fact toys to add to it. And yeah, things got real interesting for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) after Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) hit the stage, and we're gonna speak about that. So I will see you guys tomorrow. ^t-00-49-22
