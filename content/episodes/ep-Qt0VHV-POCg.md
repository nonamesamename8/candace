Where to begin? Well, the Turning Point USA Wikipedia entry got a very interesting update the night after Charlie Kirk was murdered. A certain someone was mysteriously added to the entry for the first time ever, listed as a co-founder of one of their divisions. That's interesting. I wonder who. Also, I was a bit taken aback. I was obviously away in Wyoming when President Trump (Donald Trump) honored Charlie Kirk with his very own holiday as a posthumous birthday present. But I was a little taken aback that people really believe that that would somehow put an end to the conspiracies. It's supposed to be over now because look—Charlie Kirk Day. Okay, we'll see about that. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=46" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-00-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And sticking with the Trump family, Don Jr. (Donald Trump Jr.) has come out to share his feelings regarding the FBI investigation. And man, oh man, you guys, I just am wondering how deep this thing really goes because there is not a single member of the Trump family that could have upset me more with his commentary than Don Jr. Welcome back to Candace Owens. Let's start with one of my own back-of-the-head conspiracies. It's kind of a long-running thought of mine, actually, over the years. ^t-00-00-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=90" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-01-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And it relates here to something interesting that I thought of after the show yesterday that I wanted to share with you guys regarding Charlie Kirk as a child. Charlie was obviously an extremely gifted child, so much so that he was hyperactive. He was actually always hyperactive. That never went away. He couldn't sit down. He was never idle. He was always working. But he was so gifted that, of course, doctors immediately wanted to put him on ADHD medicine because, well, why is he so hyperactive? Something's wrong with him. Let's drug him. And thankfully, Charlie's parents said, "Absolutely not." "You're not drugging our son." "He is actually, in fact, gifted." And they instead opted to send him to a school for the gifted. That's my memory. Charlie told me that story multiple times. ^t-00-01-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=135" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-02-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I thought about that. It's just been on my mind lately—living in my mind—because I truly believe that he was probably assigned life handlers from that moment on. Something probably takes place. If you go to a little X-Men school and they're seeing how smart you are, you're a part of some program. I was in extraordinary learners as a kid, but I think Charlie was in like a special X-Men school. They probably are monitoring those kids. I actually believe that the reason that we have standardized tests is so that the government can track who is performing above the standard, right? Who's performing above the average slave? We better keep an eye on that one. Just my suspicion, my own personal conspiracy theory. I think when my kids are old enough to do standardized tests—because even when you homeschool, you have to do standardized tests—I'm gonna be like, ^t-00-02-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=179" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-02-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** just get like a 70%. We don't want any government trackers sent on us. Anyways, I wanna jump back into the Turning Point USA story and tell you guys something that's been bothering me about Rob McCoy—sticking on him—other than the fact that he lies and he proclaims to be a pastor. Is the fact that less than 36 hours after Charlie died—less than 36 hours, exact time, at 10:34 p.m. Eastern on September 11th—the Turning Point USA Wikipedia received a rather interesting update. ^t-00-02-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=219" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-03-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Pastor Rob McCoy, who had previously never been featured on their Wikipedia page, somehow got his own heading. Just amazing. Let's check out that fresh entry now. It reads: "Rob McCoy and Charlie Kirk founded Turning Point USA Faith (TPUSA Faith) together." "Along with being a Pentecostal pastor in the Calvary Chapel Association, McCoy is the co-chairman of TPUSA Faith." "Aligned with the Christian right, McCoy inspired Kirk to amalgamate Christianity and social conservatism." "During the COVID-19 pandemic, McCoy was known for speaking out against prohibitions on the holding of in-person church services." ^t-00-03-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=264" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-04-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The hardest part of being me is that I came up with Turning Point USA, so I just know these lies so quickly, okay? No, Rob McCoy was not the person who inspired Turning Point USA Faith. Actually, if anybody could be credited with that, that was like way back in the day at Liberty University, actually. Those pastors, those conversations—I was there for those. "We should do like a faith division," whatever it is. He didn't inspire it. And what's so interesting about that entry is that when you then click it, this is how you know this is absurd. When you click the actual notations that are there—when it says he's the co-founder—what are you talking about? Since when is he the co-founder? And it also says that he was the chairman. ^t-00-04-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=303" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-05-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** When you click it, that article—which they pretend is a note—hit the [54], Skylar, not 55, okay? That's from November 24th, 2024. That's the justification for saying he was a founder. Nowhere in that article does it say that he's a founder or the chairman. Nowhere. They just put a fake article—a real article—that never said this. And they're like, "Oh, now it's sourced. It's here forever because nobody ever does their homework." "And we're Wikipedia. We're Wikipedia." "So you can't question this, obviously." And then you can see the second citations that are used. September—the dates of them—September 10th, 2025. So it's brand spanking new, you guys. Still has tags on it. Less than 36 hours later. ^t-00-05-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=347" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:47</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-05-47.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Now, you might be thinking—trying to justify that as I was—you might be rationally wondering, "Well, look, there was a lot of interest in Turning Point USA following this assassination." Maybe there wasn't any mention of Turning Point Faith at all. And maybe what they did was afterwards Wikipedia editors went in there and wanted to just break apart every part and speak about Turning Point USA and dedicate more thorough research to the various projects that Turning Point USA and Charlie Kirk were working on. So they included a new tab about Turning Point Faith. If you're wondering that, that's fair, but the answer to that musing is no. ^t-00-05-47

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=386" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-06-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Actually, there already was a long-standing section on the Wikipedia website regarding Turning Point Faith on Wikipedia. In fact, that section is still available if you just scroll down. And it kind of conflicts with the new section that was added 36 hours later. It makes it clear that Charlie Kirk founded TPUSA Faith alone. Here it is: "In 2021, Charlie Kirk founded TPUSA Faith, an organization that says it is dedicated to recruit pastors and other church leaders to be active in local and national political issues." "The organization promotes a culture war agenda and is intended to attract supporters among religious conservatives." ^t-00-06-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=427" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-07-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "Its activities include faith-based voter drives and educating members on TPUSA core values." Now, you can keep reading here. There's no mention of McCoy. So what this means practically is that when Charlie Kirk was alive, that is what the Wikipedia read. And then he died and suddenly somebody in the world said, "Well, what about Rob McCoy?" "Let's add Rob McCoy," who is not known worldwide. Okay, this is even before the memorial event. So you could maybe go, "Oh, well, maybe once he hit the stage and said, 'I'm Charlie's pastor,' somebody went in there and added it." I don't know, guys. My question is who made that update? Who was rather instructed to make that update? Because I can tell you how it works for big companies. ^t-00-07-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=471" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:51</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-07-51.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I was actually desperately looking for a text from Charlie because I know he told me that they—Turning Point USA's organization—had found a guy that could help clean up the Wikipedia pages, right? There are people that do this full-time, and they're paid by bigger organizations to clean up their Wikipedia pages because I remember—and I still have the messages—when we first had our pages, which were made by Wikipedia editors, and they were horrific. They said terrible things about us. It was like, "Candace, this is a racist, white nationalist, crazy person who hates BLM but she hates women," you know, the whole gamut that you're getting right now about me. And we were horrified when we looked at our Wikipedia pages. ^t-00-07-51

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=511" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-08-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And then some time passed and someone within the organization had found a person who could clean up our Wikipedia pages. Charlie told me. And I cannot remember who that individual was. It'll come to me. It will actually come to me. But I'm just interested. Do you guys think that some random person got inspired to include a whole heading of Rob McCoy 36 hours later? What do you guys think? I don't even think they had even yet announced that Erika Kirk was the chairman and the CEO 36 hours later. Like that seems that early—less than 36 hours, I should say, to be very clear—less than 36 hours later. I don't even think Charlie's body had returned back to Arizona. ^t-00-08-31

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=555" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-09-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And yet somebody was dedicated to Rob McCoy lying and claiming—this person who typed this—that he was the founder, the co-founder, Charlie's pastor. No, he wasn't. The founder of TPUSA Faith, the inspiration behind TPUSA Faith. No, he wasn't. He was one of the advisors put on the board of advisory for TPUSA Faith. I know that he gets paid by TPUSA Faith upcoming pastor summits where they're going to teach other Christian Zionist pastors how to use the Bible as a shield for their political ideas. You know, it says right here in the Bible, "Unfollow Tucker (Tucker Carlson)." ^t-00-09-15

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=595" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-09-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** There's no other way that we can understand Paul's letter to the Corinthians other than to unfollow or cross it. That's the vibe I'm getting, the direction that Turning Point was going into, and Rob McCoy was definitively going to benefit financially from that. But founder? Since when? Anyways, now let's turn our attention to other allies: President Donald Trump. Of course we have to arrive here because Charlie really loved Donald J. Trump, okay? He loved him. It is unreal going through my messages to really consider how much he dedicated his entire life to him. And I mean ^t-00-09-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=633" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-10-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** sleepless nights, wanting to ensure that he got elected, re-elected, midterm elections, hitting the ground, wearing a MAGA hat. We were everywhere. I was on fire for Trump, too. I really believed in Trump. I really believed that if people could wake up to how quickly the media turned on him, that it could be, you know, this conduit to Black Americans' understanding that we're being manipulated. Because my focus was all about Black America, right? And what I can say is that from the very moment that we learned the news that Charlie Kirk had passed, I knew spiritually that ^t-00-10-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=676" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-11-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** we were never going to get the full story from officials, right? Not from officials. I can't explain it. I felt that way. And then when Trump rushed to tweet out that—or Truth Social—post that photo, an AI photo of him and Charlie with the Star of David in the background, I just knew. I just knew. I knew the investigation into who murdered Charlie Kirk was officially over, right? ^t-00-11-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=710" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-11-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The officials wanted nothing to do with it because there was nobody more psychotically insistent that people stop asking questions about Charlie's death immediately— I mean, early hours, right?— than the people that are dedicated to the Israel lobby, right? These individuals—if you go back—people that are pro-Israel for whatever reason—were like, "Do not look any further into this death." In fact, I'll challenge you. Do me a favor. Find me one—just one—real-life pro-Israel individual who is expressing that they don't believe that Charlie Kirk was killed by Tyler Robinson. ^t-00-11-50

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=753" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-12-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** The evidence is overwhelming that Tyler Robinson didn't act alone, that Tyler Robinson didn't fire the shot, that Tyler Robinson didn't use a .30-06. Find me just one person with a platform who's pro-Israel and says, "I want this investigation into his death to continue." It's a bit weird, right? It's a bit weird. Dogs—very silent right now. Very, very silent. And there was like a stake in the ground. They're not moving. It's very weird. They do, all of them, however—I will say—want him to be honored, right? Mostly by your money. They want you to give to Turning Point USA. That's the best way, by the way, that you can honor him. Open up your pocketbooks. They don't have enough money there, right? ^t-00-12-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=798" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-13-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Clearing like a hundred million a year. They don't have enough. Open up your pockets, keep his show going, and don't ask questions is obviously the clearest way that we can honor Charlie Kirk. They want him lionized, and they did try to lionize him immediately as the most Judeo-Christian goy ever. Why not just put him in a yarmulke in some of these AI photos? That would make more sense, the direction. I mean, so instant. It's like just like trying to establish the legacy, right? And keeping with that, we want this to be honorific, not actually trying to solve what happened here. For Charlie's birthday, President Trump signed into law—or established, rather—a holiday. ^t-00-13-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=841" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-14-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And he decided that October 14th, which is Charlie Kirk's birthday, would be a National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk. Okay? And I'm gonna tell you how I feel about that. Truly, Zionists that infiltrated my book club. You did not need to pay the $9.99 to find out how I feel about this. I don't know why people think I'm hiding how I feel. It's very weird. Like when did people go, "We have to try to listen in to hear what she really thinks"? I'll tell you what I really think. I think it's crap. Okay? What I said in my book club holds. It's never good when the feds are lining up to give you a holiday. Not good. You know, Martin Luther King vibes. I don't like Martin Luther King Jr.'s holiday. ^t-00-14-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=885" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-14-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I think maybe the feds definitely killed Martin Luther King Jr. Oh, in school we get to learn about him. He's got this whole holiday. Oh, he was such a great—"I loved that 'I Have a Dream' speech." Oh, the feds. Oh man, you're good. You were so great. It's unfortunate that we had to murder you. I don't like it because the best way to honor Charlie Kirk is very obvious. Figure out who killed him first. Let's celebrate the holiday later. I want to figure out who killed him first. And so I'm struck by this. I'm struck by Trump and the lack of demand, the lack of pushing on the narrative. Trump has really represented himself—at least as me, someone who voted for him twice— ^t-00-14-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=929" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-15-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** he represented himself as an individual who didn't trust the federal establishment. This feels like an easy layup here. Your friend—he viewed you in many ways like a father figure, right? "Hey, feds, what's going on here?" And I said, maybe he did, because I was in this aggrieved stage and I really didn't poke my head up until weeks later when I could like stop crying about it every second. And I said, maybe I missed it. Maybe Trump did actually say, "This is crap." Maybe he did call for an investigation. And we did a search on Truth Social to see how many times President Trump tweeted or Truth Socialed calling for further investigation into Charlie Kirk's murder. ^t-00-15-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=973" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:13</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-16-13.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And there was only one tweet that we could find to that effect. And this tweet is not what I would describe as him calling for an investigation into Charlie Kirk's murder, actually. Here it is. This is the only one we could find. [Donald Trump (Truth Social)]: "Why was the wonderful Turning Point under investigation by deranged Jack Smith and the corrupt and incompetent Biden administration?" "They tried to force Charlie and many other people and movements out of business." "They weaponized the Justice Department against Sleepy Joe Biden's political opponents, including me." "They allowed the daughter of a judge of one of the corrupt trials against me to become the biggest fundraiser for Biden and Kamala, making millions of dollars for herself and her family." "But with her father, the judge, not only refusing to recuse himself, but putting a gag order on me, not allowing any talk about their family corruption and unprecedented conflict of interest." ^t-00-16-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=1015" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-16-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's not going to age well, the gag order thing, is it? [Donald Trump (Truth Social)]: "Every leading legal analyst and pundit said this trial was wrong and should not have been allowed to go forward." "But it did because of a corrupt judge who will hopefully pay a very big price for his illegal action someday." Okay. Scale of one to 10, how much is that? How much is that about Charlie Kirk? Do you feel about Charlie Kirk? Like, I don't know. I don't know what to think of that. I don't know what to make of that. Like I said, it's pretty obvious. They want us to just look at everything and go, "Case closed." Don't you see? We're all united. ^t-00-16-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=1059" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-17-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** We're standing up here. We're giving him a holiday. We're signing that. And we've got all these photographers here, the Turning Point chief fundraiser lady here, and she's crying. So obviously she loved Charlie. Kash Patel was there, of all the people—unbelievable to me. They're here. Kash Patel is here, so you can see we're all united. You can totally trust the FBI science now. We're ruling out corruption. That's why we don't know what Jeffrey Epstein files you're talking about. Because all we had to do was win against Democrats and corruption would be over. Are we still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? I'm sorry. You know, I've realized something actually and truly they made ^t-00-17-39

Like kudos to whoever made that call because I would have just been on my best Kanye. I would have jumped on stage and just grabbed the mic from Susie Wiles or someone and said, "Are you kidding me?" "What is going on here?" "What is happening?" Even Trump's speech—remember when he just kind of worked in the story about Charlie interviewing a fourth grader and he was referring to Breland Holland? And I'm saying Holland, by the way, because that was his name when Charlie interviewed him because Trump wasn't there—nothing to do with Trump. When Charlie went on that fourth grader's podcast, his name was Breland Holland. ^t-00-18-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=1147" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:07</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-19-07.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I was next to him. It was me and Charlie. What a weird story for Trump to just obscurely pluck out of thin air to say on stage at his memorial. He wasn't there. He had nothing to do with him. The kid had some connections and of course was really sweet and adorable and in fourth grade and super polite and energetic and was like, "I'd love to interview you." I can't remember who the guy was who was his dad. I got him the interview with us. And all of a sudden Trump's just saying the story on stage at Charlie's memorial as if he was there and he wasn't. So what's going on? Regarding Kash Patel showing his face there, I legitimately do not know how these people do it, okay? I would literally die from shame. ^t-00-19-07

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=1192" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:19:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-19-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I would pass away right immediately from shame before I would show up to that event if I was Kash Patel. Like, did they breed it out? Is this a new breed of human that I don't know about where you feel nothing? There's just nothing. It's like a Josh Hammer thing. They don't feel any sense of shame at all. And they can just go, go, go, go, go and pretend that you're honoring it. I don't understand it. I truly don't understand it because I have to be a different species from whatever that is. I would melt. I'd rather melt at the floor than show my face knowing how badly I was dropping the ball. The whole world knows—dropping the ball. How do you show up to work, Kash Patel? And the answer is he shows up to work and he demands that everybody stop looking into it because he's got it under control. ^t-00-19-52

Finally, the adults are in charge and it's going to be the most transparent administration ever— except on the Jeffrey Epstein stuff or the Charlie Kirk stuff who was a friend of the administration. We got to be a little bit opaque on real headline—New York Times yesterday—pertaining to how upset Kash Patel was when he received an inquiry from Joe Kent's office—Tulsi Gabbard's office. They lead the National Counterterrorism Center—Joe Kent does—and him inquiring about details into this apparently alarmed Kash Patel because Kash Patel was alarmed. ^t-00-20-35

He wanted to investigate the assassination—pretending to be Joe Kent. They were like, "Hey, maybe people overseas were involved in his murder." Maybe they were thinking, "Bibi's (Benjamin Netanyahu's) saying too much." "Can we just look at these files?" "That's our job: overseas terrorism." And Kash Patel was so alarmed by this—so alarmed that they would look into these files—that he held a meeting apparently. "Oh, what are you?" "This is not appropriate." "It's not appropriate for you to be looking into this, okay?" "We don't want you knowing whether or not there was a foreign power or another entity that was involved in this." ^t-00-21-20

I think it said JD Vance was in this meeting as well, and nothing was accomplished. Because why wouldn't you—if you're the most transparent administration ever—share? Get the help. "Hey, we're supposed to be partners in this." "Don't we all want to find out who killed Charlie Kirk?" And the answer is no, we don't all want to find out who killed Charlie Kirk. I think that's apparent, right? It's pretty obvious that we do not all want to find out who murdered Charlie Kirk because they're not acting right. Nobody is acting right right now.

So Joe Kent, Tulsi Gabbard—if you guys by any chance see this episode—keep going, right? We're just going very slowly here. Set the bait. We're gonna see who lies about what. And when we get back from this break, I'm going to tell you another stunning Turning Point lie that came out, and you're going to start feeling some type of way about the people who are all apparently mourning him.

I've been talking a lot about Riverbend Ranch because I absolutely love their steaks. Their black Angus beef is famous for its great flavor. Riverbend Ranch has taken black Angus beef to a whole new level. Over the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partner ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones and without antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. ^t-00-23-23

So it's born here in the USA, raised in the USA, and processed right here in the USA. Their meat is aged to perfection for 21 days, and it's shipped directly from their ranch to your home. This is not your average black Angus beef. This is more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef that I've ever had. Right now, if you head over to RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code Candace, you'll get $20 off your first order. Trust me, you are going to be very impressed. So visit RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code Candace. I also want to remind you guys about American Financing because the cost of everything is still out of control.

Charlie was very explicit. Charlie said, "If I ever get shot at an event, the left side of my neck, the first thing I want you to do is not help me, okay?" And how could we not do anything but trust the science here? We just gotta trust science. We'll never know, okay? Because I guess they're not gonna show us call logs; they're not gonna do anything—just easily put away any of these quote-unquote conspiracies that are unhealthy. I wanted to show you this comment.

"Number one, leave me with no help or first aid." That is true. He was not administered any first aid. I have close-up videos of that. Very strange to me because that's what they're supposed to be experts in: no gauze, taking out nothing, not even securing the wound as they carried him to the hospital. And I do not accept, by the way, that it was because things were crazy. He literally pays you millions of dollars a year to know what to do, security team, when things are crazy. Are you still employed? Did you fail at your one job? I don't know. I don't know. We're gonna find out. Anyways, his second instruction—this lady writes—"film your reaction in selfie mode." "Charlie must have wanted it." "It's what he would have wanted," I think. He would have wanted it. I don't know. ^t-00-27-47

"Secure the footage and never reveal it to anyone but the feds who have always been so trustworthy." "And four, quickly cover the scene in case anybody wants to get justice for me." Yeah, that really is—those are some instructions. Did Charlie Kirk have any real friends? What do you guys think? Because the more that time goes by, the more upset I am at everyone who's lying about every little thing. And I wouldn't mean literally little things, right? Not even the big things, but the little things. ^t-00-28-30

He was going to the Mass. And then suddenly Operation Mocking Pastor or Mocking Evangelical Influencer went out and they all were like, "That's not true." "That's not true." And I'm like, "What do you mean it's not true?" "Don't be absurd." "Don't be absurd." Why lie? I reflect on that moment, and I think it was right after memorial service—a couple of days after the memorial service—where Alex Clark released that interview with her and Andrew Colvett, and they struggle-sessioned through that. ^t-00-29-08

I really struggled with that, and I struggle with it even more now that I know that there have been a lot of questions about what about his burial? How come we haven't seen anything about his burial? We saw so much and then we saw nothing. And the reason that's like a big hush-hush secret is because Charlie had a Catholic funeral Mass, and he is buried in a Catholic cemetery. Yeah, he—it was, but really it was about the architecture. I want you to understand ^t-00-29-42

I think we can only speculate that it's because they're worried about the money, right? They do not want to upset the very same people who were pressuring Charlie Kirk. And I love when they say—oh, another thing Andrew said in that interview—"they're only a small portion of our donors relative to the rest of our donors." Okay, but are they cutting the bigger checks? Like Bob Shomo took $2 million away—that's gotta mean something if you brought in $70 million last year and he took away $2 million just like that. Are they cutting the bigger checks? Because that's relevant. ^t-00-30-28

I think they insisted and are pressuring them—as we are hearing—to maintain the idea that Charlie died pro-Israel. But to do that—to have the stomach to do that—to know that you knew where he was buried and attended that Mass, and you had the stomach to sit down and to gaslight me— that's what you did. You were gaslighting me, actually. Me, right? Didn't say my name, but you were referring to me, right? "Oh no, he was just the most committed evangelical." What's wrong with everybody? Why does nobody have just the—I don't know—the spirit moving within them? Just like, I don't know. ^t-00-31-08

And you're able to just sit up there like a soldier and just delude everybody—delude the masses—and sometimes do it through tears to be extra convincing. That's crazy to me. It's wild to me. Speaking on the note of who his friends are, I will tell you there was no one—like I said at the top of the show—that could have upset me more than Don Jr. Okay, Don Jr. was one of Charlie's friends—like a brother, literally a brother. Don Jr., by the way, I would say, was one of the people who very much helped to build Turning Point USA. He was there, okay? ^t-00-31-50

Oh my, I remember when Don Jr. started following me. I have the text messages with Charlie. "Oh my, Don Jr. is following me." "This is amazing." He would retweet me. The beginning of the Candace story includes Don Jr. being probably—without question, actually—the most committed Trump family member to Turning Point USA's early story. Okay?

I think Don Jr. has been probably in the shadow of his father his entire life because what he's saying when he begins to credentialize himself and said, "Oh, I was out with the Wuhan.

As his other brothers and sisters and people in the movement—people who don't even know Charlie—get to the bottom of this because everything we're being sold is absolute BS. That's my request to you, Don. Anyways, moving on from that, I do—on the topic of Israel—want to let you know that I was very excited to sit down and have a conversation which we will be releasing on Friday with Norman Finkelstein. Norman Finkelstein was probably ^t-00-38-57

I think most people didn't know—genuinely, like me—just did not know anything about the history of Gaza; knew nothing about it because it has been such a censored topic in America. And we were all told that it was our job—after all of the Holocaust movies and the Holocaust indoctrination that took place in the school system—to be triggered at the idea that anybody could have a thought against the modern state of Israel, which is only there because six million Jews perished in the Holocaust. We all grew up with that, right? ^t-00-39-34

That's the reality. And Norm Finkelstein—whose parents survived; one of his parents survived Auschwitz—was the reason I had him on my show right after October 7th—sometimes shortly thereafter—when I was at the Daily Wire. And what he told me horrified me, and it pushed me to become more educated on the topic, and I was so grateful that I was able to sit down with him again—this time on my totally owned show. And I'm just gonna show you a little trailer for that. Take a listen. [Norman Finkelstein trailer]: ^t-00-40-15

The leading UN official on Gaza describes it as, quote, "a toxic dump." For the people of Israel, Gazans are vermin. They're garbage. They're human refuse. ^t-00-40-51

So we looked, and we pierced that veil. We went, "Oh my goodness, how was I ever so provincial?" And now you want us to shut up. There is a problem here. A billionaire class of Jewish supremacists are now flagrantly using money as a blackmail weapon to silence not just criticism of Jews, but silence criticism of an ongoing genocide. ^t-00-41-16

We did—I think—just over two hours discussing everything. And if you are someone who—you're in limbo on the topic—I was certainly in limbo on the topic a couple of years ago; I no longer am in limbo—and you want to hear it from somebody who both has the credentials, the experience, and also happens to be Jewish, then this is definitely the interview to listen to. Again, we'll be releasing that on Friday. Okay, gonna do a couple of sponsors before I get to some of your comments and questions. All right, you guys, the fall is here. The air is crisp, the leaves are changing, and it's the perfect time for cozy clothes. And the absolute best thing that I've treated myself to this season is the Cozy Earth pajama set.

It's part of our daily routine. We drink it every morning. And honestly, I cannot imagine starting the day without it. It's not just about the taste either. And that's great. But the coffee stands for something that we deeply believe in. Seven Weeks Coffee is America's pro-life coffee company on a mission to fund the pro-life movement one cup of coffee at a time. They're called Seven Weeks. You know the reason why: because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean. That's the same time that a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. They've built their business around saving lives by donating 10% of every sale to pregnancy centers and pro-life organizations nationwide. They've now raised over $1 million and saved thousands of lives. I can tell you—like I said—the coffee is amazing. I'm picky. ^t-00-43-31

I always tell you guys about Neemie Skincare, so I'm gonna keep doing that because for years I feel like the beauty industry convinced us that we need all these complex formulas to achieve healthy skin—all these steps. But the real secret to healthy skin is simple skincare routines. ^t-00-44-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2692" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:44:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-44-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's why I was so interested when I found Neemie Skincare, because they're doing something radical by making things simple. They built one of the most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth, which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils, which means that your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Neemie has two products from their tallow line that you should know about first: your daily hydration. There's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light; it absorbs quickly, and it doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling. They've combined that tallow with soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil, which I love. It's perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind. ^t-00-44-52

It's an ultra-rich balm that uses tallow and beeswax to create a protective barrier. It locks in moisture and shields your skin from the elements, allowing it to heal. This is skincare the way that it was meant to be, which is simple, pure, and powerfully effective. It's a focus on skin-loving ingredients made right here in the USA.

All right, so yesterday in the comments, we had a few people who were asking about the new relic behind me. And I can tell you quickly how I got it. Obviously, it is new. When we were in Wyoming, we traveled with priests. ^t-00-45-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2779" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:46:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-46-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's something that my husband and I began doing not last year—the year before last year. And it has enriched our experience traveling as a family and kind of checking in with yourself and thinking through things theologically and also feeling a sense of protection to be able to pray. I know that I have received so many emails from people and comments from people who felt compelled— for some reason that you didn't even know. People said, "I haven't gone to church in 45 years, and after I watched Charlie be assassinated, I knew that I needed to go to church." Don't ignore that, okay? You are not like a paper bag floating in the wind like Katy Perry's song said. You do have a spirit, and what you are pulling—everyone feels that we are in some sort of a spiritual battle now. You're starting to wake up. ^t-00-46-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2824" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:47:04</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-47-04.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I feel a lot of people right now are starting to wake up and realize something is wrong. I mean, people are asking, "Do we live in a matrix?" "Do we live in a military industrial complex?" You recognize something is very wrong. Do not ignore your gut on that, okay? You do not descend from homo sapiens, australopithecus. That is not the story of man. That's not the story of man. That's not where you were from. Like I said, you have a spirit, and there is more. There is more. Of course there is more. Of course there is life after death, okay? And the idea that they want you to believe is, "No, no, no—this is it." "You're here for about 80 years, so you just better be selfish and allow us to enslave you here where we have dominion." ^t-00-47-04

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2865" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:47:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-47-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I'm talking about these demons that we are fighting—where we have dominion by getting you to compromise your values, compromise who you are, to sell your soul in some circumstances, right? That's not an expression. People—we have observed this—have literally sold their souls. They don't understand that. They won't understand that until they die or realize what that actually means. They don't understand that hell is for an eternity, okay? And how we got here—that the story of St. Michael leading the angels in heaven, the great battle in heaven, knocking Satan and the angels that were behind him down to the earth—that is all very real. And St. Michael is a prayer of protection that I feel is very powerful. ^t-00-47-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2908" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:48:28</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-48-28.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's a very powerful prayer that we say every Sunday at Mass. And I think that, you know, just the way it starts: "St. Michael, defend us in battle." "Be our protection against the wickedness and the snares of the devil." "May God rebuke him, we humbly pray." "And do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls." Amen. It's a powerful prayer. And we're there. We need protection, okay? But I do think that once again, goodness—light—is going to win. ^t-00-48-28

People in Turning Point had dreams. There was one young woman who emailed me and said, "Candace, like, I just have to tell you, the week leading up to this, I had a very vivid dream about so-and-so at the company and six snakes that were around him." And I didn't know that Charlie was going to be assassinated, and this person recounted their dream in detail. And there were many people who dreamed—for whatever reason—the number six was in their dreams in terms of the weapon; whatever it was, it was six—that was appearing. And so I'm kind of going by a vibe that there may be six people who betrayed him by the end of this because there was one too many dreams that affect—from people around the world. ^t-00-49-12

Anyway, some more comments that we have here. Max Hardy writes: "Hey, Candace, I'm 16 and homeschooled." "I watch every episode." "We are praying for your protection." "I just got Blackout the Book, Finishing the College Scam." "And then I will definitely have to get Josh Hammer's book because Charlie supported it and just wanted everybody to read it." No, of course—duh. Like, obviously. Are you kidding me? Like ASAP. It was basically his last words, right? And then, you know, that was what he said: "Josh Hammer, sell your book no matter what, man." Also on his list of instructions. Maria Garcia writes: "Candace, what does it mean to be Charlie's David?" I think it probably means that we got to slay some Goliaths. May God bless you. Who knows? ^t-00-49-55

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=3039" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:50:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-50-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I mean, we never could have imagined the weight of what his dreams were— what I take from it and what I understood and why it brought me to tears when I realized that this moment happened is he knew his life was going to be short, and he knew that for whatever reason I was going to be the only one that defended him publicly— that would go to war with everyone. And I mean that with everyone. I just don't care. You don't get to do this. You don't get to force me to watch someone that I came up with catch a bullet in his throat and then tell me to shut up, okay? There's got to be rules here. You don't get to do this. And you're losing. You feel that, right? You feel the energy is not behind you. There's a reason for that. ^t-00-50-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=3084" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:51:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-51-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** There isn't any energy behind you. The energy is not going to follow darkness. It's just not. Tdos writes: "I wore my Candace CIA sweater in public today." "A woman came up to me and called me brave and said, 'Good for you.'" "I love it." "In that moment, I was so proud to be on the side of truth." "Keep going and don't stop." "You are so supported." I know. I know that I am not supported by the people in suits. I know I am not supported by, you know, Susie Wiles' White House. I know that I am not supported by the donors—the big donors—the Jewish donors at Turning Point USA who are pressuring Charlie. But I know that none of that matters. None of that actually matters. And guess what? I didn't sell my soul. Didn't sell my soul. ^t-00-51-24

Christine Jones writes: "TPUSA died with Charlie." I mean, I've seen a lot of your comments about like the show is not the same, and it's because nothing can survive when it is being choked by lies. And that's ultimately what I hope for these people. Going back to my point that I actually don't believe in the death penalty because it's too easy— for the people who didn't kill Charlie but perhaps betrayed him before or after—because I feel like accepting this bogus narrative is an act of betrayal. I want these people to go through the rest of their lives—long lives. I want them to have long lives, actually. ^t-00-52-07

They can feel the energy of people knowing, "You too. We know." I want them to feel that energy. It doesn't matter who you are; it doesn't matter what promotion you get; what title you have; what chief you are. The people around you in every room you walk into know, right? They don't know, but they know. And that should mean everything. Melanie Smiles writes: "Candace, this is bigger than what the world thinks." "Charlie knew you understood the assignment." "Charlie's David—you are chosen for such a time as this." ^t-00-52-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=3212" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:53:32</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-53-32.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "God will protect you." "Nothing will harm you." Bayes writes: "The fact that they tried to pass that off as a wound from a .30-06 just tells us how stupid they think that we really are." They overestimated those Maxwell-published textbooks that they tried to indoctrinate us with. I'm glad people are waking up. Yeah, if you don't know what he's referencing, Ghislaine Maxwell's father did indeed begin—alongside, I think it was Macmillan; don't quote me—it was like Maxwell Macmillan publishing—our textbooks coming from the Jeffrey Epstein empire is kind of amazing. We discussed this in our Epstein series. If you'd like to go back and watch that, we've saved that on YouTube as one of the series, and it's a good one to go through—just start to understand how this all works. ^t-00-53-32

"It's totally corrupt now, according to him, and he got pushed out." Now he got—it was always corrupt. I mean, we showed you that video of—at the time he was not the prime minister of Israel, but he became the prime minister of Israel—and he showed how they were training people to edit articles on Wikipedia so that it favored Zionists and the Zionist cause. It was just like—it's an incredible clip. You got to find it. We've showed it a few times, but it's so Israel—it's incredible. Timothy writes: "The effort to discredit you, Candace, for noticing so much is revealing." "Any logical person without an agenda thinks and says the same things that you do." ^t-00-54-13

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=3295" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:54:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-54-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** "It just makes too much sense, and they are downright evil." Yeah, and the psychology of it is just painstaking, right? It's like, "If you care, you like porn." "If you care, you just want clicks." "If you care"—like trying to make us dirty. It's just nonsense. It's like I said: we have to steel ourselves against their psychology. These are like military psychological operations. It's why they need bots on the internet—which they're doing. As we learned, they're buying so many bots on the internet. It's a stake that Israel is taking. It's why they want TikTok—because they want you to feel that pressure that Charlie felt: like everyone thinks it's but you, so you feel isolated. The goal of that is isolation. It's a psychological component: ^t-00-54-55

Do what the rest of everybody does. "Everybody here loves Israel." "It's just you that doesn't love it." "So something's wrong with you." It's exact same thing here. No. Let me tell you something right now. We are the majority. It is so obvious to me. Melanie writes: "In conclusion, Candace, this is bigger." Oh, actually, you already wrote that. This is bigger than what the world thinks, and I absolutely believe that. You guys, if you would like to support our continued work, I tell you—you're gonna love this one. I am very proud of this. Tag me if you got this book. It makes me very excited. You can go to MakeHimASandwich.com to buy your copy of the book. I think I should probably do some signed ones, too. I'll do that before Christmas. Savannah, if you wanna make a note for that. ^t-00-55-39

Actually, it was a government initiative sponsored by the children of Bolsheviks, obviously. And beyond that, you can head to CandaceOwens.com; buy yourself some gear—some CIA gear. We don't know, but we do know—and we have restocked our "We Don't Know" cups to that effect. So thank you guys so much for all the support. I am remarkably clear-minded on this. I'm actually very positive on this. ^t-00-56-19
