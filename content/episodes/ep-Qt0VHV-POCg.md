I was obviously away in <span id="ent-gpe-wyoming-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a></span> when President <span id="ent-person-donald-trump-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Trump</a></span> honored <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> with his very own holiday as a posthumous birthday present. But I was a little taken aback that people really believe that that would somehow put an end to the conspiracies.

And man, oh man, you guys, I just am wondering how deep this thing really goes because there is not a single member of the <a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Trump</a> family that could have upset me more with his commentary than Don Jr. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-46"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span>.

But he was so gifted that, of course, doctors immediately wanted to put him on ADHD medicine because, well, why is he so hyperactive? Something's wrong with him. Let's drug him. <span id="claim-claim-c36a3beef7cd-t-00-01-30">And thankfully, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s parents said, "Absolutely not." "You're not drugging our son."

It's just been on my mind lately—living in my mind—because I truly believe that he was probably assigned life handlers from that moment on. Something probably takes place. If you go to a little X-Men school and they're seeing how smart you are, you're a part of some program. I was in extraordinary learners as a kid, but I think Charlie was in like a special X-Men school. They probably are monitoring those kids. <span id="claim-claim-c15ec0448122-t-00-02-15">I actually believe that the reason that we have standardized tests is so that the government can track who is performing above the standard, right<a href="/claims/claim-c15ec0448122.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>? Who's performing above the average slave? We better keep an eye on that one. Just my suspicion, my own personal conspiracy theory.

Just amazing. Let's check out that fresh entry now. <span id="claim-claim-16d48a713cbe-t-00-03-39">It reads: "<a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a> and <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> founded <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-faith-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">Turning Point USA Faith</a></span> (<a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">TPUSA Faith</a>) together." "Along with being a Pentecostal pastor in the <span id="ent-org-calvary-chapel-association-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/org-calvary-chapel-association.md">Calvary Chapel Association</a></span>, McCoy is the co-chairman of <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">TPUSA Faith</a>." "Aligned with the Christian right, McCoy inspired Kirk<a href="/claims/claim-16d48a713cbe.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span> to amalgamate Christianity and social conservatism." "During the <span id="ent-event-covid-19-pandemic-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/event-covid-19-pandemic.md">COVID-19 pandemic</a></span>, McCoy was known for speaking out against prohibitions on the holding of in-person church services." ^t-00-03-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-04-24.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:24</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=264" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The hardest part of being me is that I came up with <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, so I just know these lies so quickly, okay? No, <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span> was not the person who inspired <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-faith-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">Turning Point USA Faith</a></span>. Actually, if anybody could be credited with that, that was like way back in the day at <span id="ent-org-liberty-university-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/org-liberty-university.md">Liberty University</a></span>, actually. Those pastors, those conversations—I was there for those. "We should do like a faith division," whatever it is. He didn't inspire it. And what's so interesting about that entry is that when you then click it, this is how you know this is absurd. When you click the actual notations that are there—when it says he's the co-founder—what are you talking about? Since when is he the co-founder? And it also says that he was the chairman. ^t-00-04-24

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-05-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=303" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** When you click it, that article—which they pretend is a note—hit the [54], Skylar, not 55, okay?

Nowhere in that article does it say that he's a founder or the chairman. Nowhere. They just put a fake article—a real article—that never said this. And they're like, "Oh, now it's sourced. It's here forever because nobody ever does their homework." "And we're Wikipedia. We're Wikipedia." "So you can't question this, obviously." And then you can see the second citations that are used. <span id="claim-claim-95b2eca2a4f8-t-00-05-03">September—the dates of them—<span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>, <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span><a href="/claims/claim-95b2eca2a4f8.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>.

Maybe there wasn't any mention of <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> Faith at all. And maybe what they did was afterwards Wikipedia editors went in there and wanted to just break apart every part and speak about <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> and dedicate more thorough research to the various projects that <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> and <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-47"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> were working on. So they included a new tab about <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> Faith. If you're wondering that, that's fair, but the answer to that musing is no. ^t-00-05-47

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-06-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=386" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Actually, there already was a long-standing section on the Wikipedia website regarding <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-06-26"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> Faith on Wikipedia. In fact, that section is still available if you just scroll down. And it kind of conflicts with the new section that was added 36 hours later. It makes it clear that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-26"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> founded <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-faith-t-00-06-26"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">TPUSA Faith</a></span> alone. Here it is: "In 2021, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> founded <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">TPUSA Faith</a>, an organization that says it is dedicated to recruit pastors and other church leaders to be active in local and national political issues.<span id="event-event-2021-01-01-charlie-kirk-founded-turning-point-usa-f-t-00-06-26"><a href="/events/event-2021-01-01-charlie-kirk-founded-turning-point-usa-f.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>" "The organization promotes a culture war agenda and is intended to attract supporters among religious conservatives." ^t-00-06-26

Now, you can keep reading here. There's no mention of McCoy. So what this means practically is that when <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-07"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> was alive, that is what the Wikipedia read. And then he died and suddenly somebody in the world said, "Well, what about <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-07-07"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>?" "Let's add <a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a>," who is not known worldwide. Okay, this is even before the memorial event. So you could maybe go, "Oh, well, maybe once he hit the stage and said, 'I'm <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s pastor,' somebody went in there and added it." I don't know, guys. My question is who made that update? Who was rather instructed to make that update? Because I can tell you how it works for big companies. ^t-00-07-07

There are people that do this full-time, and they're paid by bigger organizations to clean up their Wikipedia pages because I remember—and I still have the messages—when we first had our pages, which were made by Wikipedia editors, and they were horrific. They said terrible things about us. It was like, "Candace, this is a racist, white nationalist, crazy person who hates <span id="ent-org-black-lives-matter-t-00-07-51"><a href="/entities/org-black-lives-matter.md">BLM</a></span> but she hates women," you know, the whole gamut that you're getting right now about me.

Their black Angus beef is famous for its great flavor. <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> has taken black Angus beef to a whole new level. Over the last 35 years, <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partner ranches receive a substantial premium from <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones and without antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. ^t-00-23-23

Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing in the past. Maybe you hesitated because you didn't want to give up your low mortgage rate that you're currently enjoying. Well, there's good news because they've now created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. And unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment, giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing today and start saving. ^t-00-24-51

"Number one, leave me with no help or first aid." That is true. He was not administered any first aid. I have close-up videos of that. Very strange to me because that's what they're supposed to be experts in: no gauze, taking out nothing, not even securing the wound as they carried him to the hospital. And I do not accept, by the way, that it was because things were crazy. He literally pays you millions of dollars a year to know what to do, security team, when things are crazy. Are you still employed? Did you fail at your one job? I don't know. I don't know. We're gonna find out. Anyways, his second instruction—this lady writes—"film your reaction in selfie mode."

And I'm like, "What do you mean it's not true?" "Don't be absurd." "Don't be absurd." Why lie? I reflect on that moment, and I think it was right after memorial service—a couple of days after the memorial service—where <span id="ent-person-alex-clark-t-00-29-08"><a href="/entities/person-alex-clark.md">Alex Clark</a></span> released that interview with her and <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-29-08"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span>, and they struggle-sessioned through that. ^t-00-29-08

We saw so much and then we saw nothing. <span id="claim-claim-35daac822cf3-t-00-29-42">And the reason that's like a big hush-hush secret is because Charlie had a Catholic funeral Mass, and he is buried in a Catholic cemetery<a href="/claims/claim-35daac822cf3.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>.

They do not want to upset the very same people who were pressuring <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-30-28"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>. And I love when they say—oh, another thing Andrew said in that interview—"they're only a small portion of our donors relative to the rest of our donors." Okay, but are they cutting the bigger checks?

But to do that—to have the stomach to do that—to know that you knew where he was buried and attended that Mass, and you had the stomach to sit down and to gaslight me— that's what you did. You were gaslighting me, actually. Me, right? Didn't say my name, but you were referring to me, right? "Oh no, he was just the most committed evangelical." What's wrong with everybody?

Speaking on the note of who his friends are, I will tell you there was no one—like I said at the top of the show—that could have upset me more than Don Jr. Okay, Don Jr. was one of Charlie's friends—like a brother, literally a brother.

Okay, the first thing that I want to say is that Don Jr. is not a bad guy. He's not a bad guy. Don Jr. is probably maybe akin in some ways to <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-35-31"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>. I look at <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>—I don't know <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a> at all—and I don't think he's an evil person. I think he is in the shadow of his father, right? I think he's in the shadow of his father. I think Don Jr. has been probably in the shadow of his father his entire life because what he's saying when he begins to credentialize himself and said, "Oh, I was out with the Wuhan. I said this about <span id="ent-event-covid-19-pandemic-t-00-35-31"><a href="/entities/event-covid-19-pandemic.md">COVID</a></span>"—that's all true. That's the real Don Jr. ^t-00-35-31

And that's what I mean when I say someone who was in the shadow of his father, and it's a tough situation to be in. So I do wanna be charitable in terms of thinking of that particular dynamic when dad is saying this needs to be done and you have to carry on knowing that you had a real relationship with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-36-09"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>—because you did have a relationship with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. But Don—from me to you—it's better to say nothing, okay? It's better to say, "I'm just not going to answer that question." ^t-00-36-09

Because I looked at this clip and it bothered me for a lot of reasons because I know who you are. I know who you are. You're a hunter. You love to hunt, Don, right? Every picture of you—you're in the wilderness your whole life. You love to be in the wild. In fact, you taught me a lot about the wild and a lot about hunting. And my favorite fishing experience is actually with you, right? Fighting back the sea lions or the seals in <span id="ent-gpe-british-columbia-t-00-36-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-british-columbia.md">British Columbia</a></span>. You know nature. And I'm not going to ask you to go against the nature of honoring your father, but I am going to ask you not to lie. And as a hunter, ^t-00-36-55

His neck was not even destroyed by a .30-06. That kind of a miracle, Don. You know hunting; you know guns. And so I'm asking you if this is truly what you believe ^t-00-37-41

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-38-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:38:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2300" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** to clarify that matter: make a video, sit down with me, look me in the eye and say, "Candace, I really do think that Charlie—our friend—because you are his friend; you are his brother—stopped a .30-06 with his neck, which stayed intact." You won't say that, Don. You won't say that because it's untrue, and I think that spiritually it would mess with you, and the hunters that are listening know that you don't believe that. You know too much, okay? So again, I'm gonna ask you: if you cannot say anything, I understand the ties that bind. ^t-00-38-20

As his other brothers and sisters and people in the movement—people who don't even know Charlie—get to the bottom of this because everything we're being sold is absolute BS. That's my request to you, Don. Anyways, moving on from that, I do—on the topic of <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a>—want to let you know that I was very excited to sit down and have a conversation which we will be releasing on Friday with <span id="ent-person-norman-finkelstein-t-00-38-57"><a href="/entities/person-norman-finkelstein.md">Norman Finkelstein</a></span>. <a href="/entities/person-norman-finkelstein.md">Norman Finkelstein</a> was probably ^t-00-38-57

I think most people didn't know—genuinely, like me—just did not know anything about the history of Gaza; knew nothing about it because it has been such a censored topic in America. And we were all told that it was our job—after all of the Holocaust movies and the Holocaust indoctrination that took place in the school system—to be triggered at the idea that anybody could have a thought against the modern state of <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-39-34"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, which is only there because six million Jews perished in the Holocaust. We all grew up with that, right? ^t-00-39-34

That's the reality. And <span id="ent-person-norman-finkelstein-t-00-40-15"><a href="/entities/person-norman-finkelstein.md">Norm Finkelstein</a></span>—whose parents survived; one of his parents survived Auschwitz—was the reason I had him on my show right after <span id="ent-date-october-7th-t-00-40-15"><a href="/entities/date-october-7th.md">October 7th</a></span>—sometimes shortly thereafter—when I was at <span id="ent-org-the-daily-wire-t-00-40-15"><a href="/entities/org-the-daily-wire.md">the Daily Wire</a></span>. And what he told me horrified me, and it pushed me to become more educated on the topic, and I was so grateful that I was able to sit down with him again—this time on my totally owned show. And I'm just gonna show you a little trailer for that. Take a listen. [Norman Finkelstein trailer]: ^t-00-40-15

The leading UN official on Gaza describes it as, quote, "a toxic dump." For the people of <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-40-51"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, Gazans are vermin.

So we looked, and we pierced that veil. We went, "Oh my goodness, how was I ever so provincial?" And now you want us to shut up. There is a problem here. A billionaire class of Jewish supremacists are now flagrantly using money as a blackmail weapon to silence not just criticism of Jews, but silence criticism of an ongoing genocide. ^t-00-41-16

We did—I think—just over two hours discussing everything. And if you are someone who—you're in limbo on the topic—I was certainly in limbo on the topic a couple of years ago; I no longer am in limbo—and you want to hear it from somebody who both has the credentials, the experience, and also happens to be Jewish, then this is definitely the interview to listen to. Again, we'll be releasing that on Friday. Okay, gonna do a couple of sponsors before I get to some of your comments and questions. All right, you guys, the fall is here. The air is crisp, the leaves are changing, and it's the perfect time for cozy clothes. And the absolute best thing that I've treated myself to this season is the Cozy Earth pajama set. These are the softest PJs that I've ever owned. They're made from viscose bamboo ^t-00-42-05

It's part of our daily routine. We drink it every morning. And honestly, I cannot imagine starting the day without it. It's not just about the taste either. And that's great. But the coffee stands for something that we deeply believe in. Seven Weeks Coffee is America's pro-life coffee company on a mission to fund the pro-life movement one cup of coffee at a time. They're called Seven Weeks. You know the reason why: because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean. That's the same time that a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. They've built their business around saving lives by donating 10% of every sale to pregnancy centers and pro-life organizations nationwide. They've now raised over $1 million and saved thousands of lives. I can tell you—like I said—the coffee is amazing. I'm picky. ^t-00-43-31

I always tell you guys about Neemie Skincare, so I'm gonna keep doing that because for years I feel like the beauty industry convinced us that we need all these complex formulas to achieve healthy skin—all these steps. But the real secret to healthy skin is simple skincare routines. ^t-00-44-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-44-52.md" class="timestamp-link">00:44:52</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2692" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That's why I was so interested when I found Neemie Skincare, because they're doing something radical by making things simple. They built one of the most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth, which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils, which means that your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Neemie has two products from their tallow line that you should know about first: your daily hydration. There's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light; it absorbs quickly, and it doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling. They've combined that tallow with soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil, which I love. It's perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind. ^t-00-44-52

It's an ultra-rich balm that uses tallow and beeswax to create a protective barrier. It locks in moisture and shields your skin from the elements, allowing it to heal. This is skincare the way that it was meant to be, which is simple, pure, and powerfully effective. It's a focus on skin-loving ingredients made right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-45-37"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>.

All right, so yesterday in the comments, we had a few people who were asking about the new relic behind me. And I can tell you quickly how I got it. Obviously, it is new. When we were in <span id="ent-gpe-wyoming-t-00-45-37"><a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a></span>, we traveled with priests. ^t-00-45-37

And it has enriched our experience traveling as a family and kind of checking in with yourself and thinking through things theologically and also feeling a sense of protection to be able to pray. I know that I have received so many emails from people and comments from people who felt compelled— for some reason that you didn't even know. People said, "I haven't gone to church in 45 years, and after I watched Charlie be assassinated, I knew that I needed to go to church." Don't ignore that, okay? You are not like a paper bag floating in the wind like Katy Perry's song said. You do have a spirit, and what you are pulling—everyone feels that we are in some sort of a spiritual battle now. You're starting to wake up. ^t-00-46-19

I mean, people are asking, "Do we live in a matrix?" "Do we live in a military industrial complex?" You recognize something is very wrong. Do not ignore your gut on that, okay? You do not descend from homo sapiens, australopithecus. That is not the story of man. That's not the story of man. That's not where you were from. Like I said, you have a spirit, and there is more. There is more. Of course there is more. Of course there is life after death, okay? And the idea that they want you to believe is, "No, no, no—this is it." "You're here for about 80 years, so you just better be selfish and allow us to enslave you here where we have dominion." ^t-00-47-04

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-47-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:47:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2865" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm talking about these demons that we are fighting—where we have dominion by getting you to compromise your values, compromise who you are, to sell your soul in some circumstances, right? That's not an expression. People—we have observed this—have literally sold their souls. They don't understand that. They won't understand that until they die or realize what that actually means. They don't understand that hell is for an eternity, okay? And how we got here—that the story of St. Michael leading the angels in heaven, the great battle in heaven, knocking Satan and the angels that were behind him down to the earth—that is all very real. And St. Michael is a prayer of protection that I feel is very powerful. ^t-00-47-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-48-28.md" class="timestamp-link">00:48:28</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2908" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It's a very powerful prayer that we say every Sunday at Mass. And I think that, you know, just the way it starts: "St. Michael, defend us in battle." "Be our protection against the wickedness and the snares of the <span id="ent-concept-devil-t-00-48-28"><a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a></span>." "May God rebuke him, we humbly pray." "And do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls." Amen. It's a powerful prayer. And we're there. We need protection, okay? But I do think that once again, goodness—light—is going to win. ^t-00-48-28

People in <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-49-12"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> had dreams. There was one young woman who emailed me and said, "Candace, like, I just have to tell you, the week leading up to this, I had a very vivid dream about so-and-so at the company and six snakes that were around him." And I didn't know that Charlie was going to be assassinated, and this person recounted their dream in detail. And there were many people who dreamed—for whatever reason—the number six was in their dreams in terms of the weapon; whatever it was, it was six—that was appearing. And so I'm kind of going by a vibe that there may be six people who betrayed him by the end of this because there was one too many dreams that affect—from people around the world. ^t-00-49-12

Anyway, some more comments that we have here. Max Hardy writes: "Hey, Candace, I'm 16 and homeschooled." "I watch every episode." "We are praying for your protection." "I just got Blackout the Book, Finishing the College Scam." "And then I will definitely have to get <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-49-55"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span>'s book because Charlie supported it and just wanted everybody to read it." No, of course—duh. Like, obviously. Are you kidding me? Like ASAP. It was basically his last words, right? And then, you know, that was what he said: "<a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a>, sell your book no matter what, man." Also on his list of instructions. Maria Garcia writes: "Candace, what does it mean to be Charlie's David?" I think it probably means that we got to slay some Goliaths. May God bless you. Who knows? ^t-00-49-55

And I mean that with everyone. I just don't care. You don't get to do this. You don't get to force me to watch someone that I came up with catch a bullet in his throat and then tell me to shut up, okay? There's got to be rules here. You don't get to do this. And you're losing. You feel that, right? You feel the energy is not behind you. There's a reason for that. ^t-00-50-39

"I love it." "In that moment, I was so proud to be on the side of truth." "Keep going and don't stop." "You are so supported." I know. I know that I am not supported by the people in suits.

Christine Jones writes: "<span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-52-07"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a></span> died with Charlie." I mean, I've seen a lot of your comments about like the show is not the same, and it's because nothing can survive when it is being choked by lies. And that's ultimately what I hope for these people. Going back to my point that I actually don't believe in the death penalty because it's too easy— for the people who didn't kill Charlie but perhaps betrayed him before or after—because I feel like accepting this bogus narrative is an act of betrayal. I want these people to go through the rest of their lives—long lives. I want them to have long lives, actually. ^t-00-52-07

They can feel the energy of people knowing, "You too. We know." I want them to feel that energy. It doesn't matter who you are; it doesn't matter what promotion you get; what title you have; what chief you are. The people around you in every room you walk into know, right? They don't know, but they know. And that should mean everything. Melanie Smiles writes: "Candace, this is bigger than what the world thinks." "Charlie knew you understood the assignment."

"Nothing will harm you." Bayes writes: "The fact that they tried to pass that off as a wound from a .30-06 just tells us how stupid they think that we really are." They overestimated those Maxwell-published textbooks that they tried to indoctrinate us with. I'm glad people are waking up. Yeah, if you don't know what he's referencing, <span id="ent-person-ghislaine-maxwell-t-00-53-32"><a href="/entities/person-ghislaine-maxwell.md">Ghislaine Maxwell</a></span>'s father did indeed begin—alongside, I think it was Macmillan; don't quote me—it was like Maxwell Macmillan publishing—our textbooks coming from the <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-53-32"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span> empire is kind of amazing.

"It's totally corrupt now, according to him, and he got pushed out." Now he got—it was always corrupt. I mean, we showed you that video of—at the time he was not the prime minister of <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-54-13"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, but he became the prime minister of <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a>—and he showed how they were training people to edit articles on Wikipedia so that it favored <span id="ent-concept-zionism-t-00-54-13"><a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionists</a></span> and the <a href="/entities/concept-zionism.md">Zionist</a> cause.

Yeah, and the psychology of it is just painstaking, right? It's like, "If you care, you like porn." "If you care, you just want clicks." "If you care"—like trying to make us dirty. It's just nonsense. It's like I said: we have to steel ourselves against their psychology. These are like military psychological operations. It's why they need bots on the internet—which they're doing. As we learned, they're buying so many bots on the internet. It's a stake that <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-54-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> is taking. It's why they want <span id="ent-org-tiktok-t-00-54-55"><a href="/entities/org-tiktok.md">TikTok</a></span>—because they want you to feel that pressure that Charlie felt: like everyone thinks it's but you, so you feel isolated.

"So something's wrong with you." It's exact same thing here. No. Let me tell you something right now. We are the majority. It is so obvious to me. Melanie writes: "In conclusion, Candace, this is bigger." Oh, actually, you already wrote that. This is bigger than what the world thinks, and I absolutely believe that. You guys, if you would like to support our continued work, I tell you—you're gonna love this one. I am very proud of this. Tag me if you got this book. It makes me very excited.

Actually, it was a government initiative sponsored by the children of <span id="ent-concept-bolsheviks-t-00-56-19"><a href="/entities/concept-bolsheviks.md">Bolsheviks</a></span>, obviously. And beyond that, you can head to CandaceOwens.com; buy yourself some gear—some CIA gear. We don't know, but we do know—and we have restocked our "We Don't Know" cups to that effect.
