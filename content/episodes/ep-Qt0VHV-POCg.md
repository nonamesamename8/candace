But I was a little taken aback that people really believe that that would somehow put an end to the conspiracies.

He was actually always hyperactive. That never went away. He couldn't sit down. He was never idle. He was always working. But he was so gifted that, of course, doctors immediately wanted to put him on ADHD medicine because, well, why is he so hyperactive? Something's wrong with him. Let's drug him. And thankfully, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s parents said, "Absolutely not." "You're not drugging our son." "He is actually, in fact, gifted." And they instead opted to send him to a school for the gifted. That's my memory. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> told me that story multiple times.<span id="event-event-2025-10-28-new-york-times-reports-kash-patel-alarmed-by-joe-k-t-00-01-30"><a href="/events/event-2025-10-28-new-york-times-reports-kash-patel-alarmed-by-joe-k.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-01-30

It's just been on my mind lately—living in my mind—because I truly believe that he was probably assigned life handlers from that moment on. Something probably takes place. If you go to a little X-Men school and they're seeing how smart you are, you're a part of some program. I was in extraordinary learners as a kid, but I think <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-15"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was in like a special X-Men school. They probably are monitoring those kids. I actually believe that the reason that we have standardized tests is so that the government can track who is performing above the standard, right? Who's performing above the average slave? We better keep an eye on that one. Just my suspicion, my own personal conspiracy theory. I think when my kids are old enough to do standardized tests—because even when you homeschool, you have to do standardized tests—I'm gonna be like, ^t-00-02-15

Anyways, I wanna jump back into the <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-59"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> story and tell you guys something that's been bothering me about <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-02-59"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>—sticking on him—other than the fact that he lies and he proclaims to be a pastor.

Just amazing. Let's check out that fresh entry now. It reads: "<a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a> and <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> founded <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-faith-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">Turning Point USA Faith</a></span> (<a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">TPUSA Faith</a>) together." "Along with being a Pentecostal pastor in the <span id="ent-org-calvary-chapel-association-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/org-calvary-chapel-association.md">Calvary Chapel Association</a></span>, McCoy is the co-chairman of <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">TPUSA Faith</a>." "Aligned with the Christian right, McCoy inspired Kirk to amalgamate Christianity and social conservatism." "During the <span id="ent-event-covid-19-pandemic-t-00-03-39"><a href="/entities/event-covid-19-pandemic.md">COVID-19 pandemic</a></span>, McCoy was known for speaking out against prohibitions on the holding of in-person church services." ^t-00-03-39

No, <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span> was not the person who inspired <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-faith-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">Turning Point USA Faith</a></span>. Actually, if anybody could be credited with that, that was like way back in the day at <span id="ent-org-liberty-university-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/org-liberty-university.md">Liberty University</a></span>, actually. Those pastors, those conversations—I was there for those. "We should do like a faith division," whatever it is. He didn't inspire it. And what's so interesting about that entry is that when you then click it, this is how you know this is absurd. When you click the actual notations that are there—when it says he's the co-founder—what are you talking about? Since when is he the co-founder? And it also says that he was the chairman. ^t-00-04-24

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-05-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=303" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** When you click it, that article—which they pretend is a note—hit the [54], <span id="ent-person-skylar-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/person-skylar.md">Skylar</a></span>, not 55, okay? That's from November 24th, <span id="ent-date-2024-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/date-2024.md">2024</a></span>. That's the justification for saying he was a founder.<span id="event-event-2024-11-24-article-cited-in-wikipedia-update-about--t-00-05-03"><a href="/events/event-2024-11-24-article-cited-in-wikipedia-update-about-.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> Nowhere in that article does it say that he's a founder or the chairman. Nowhere. They just put a fake article—a real article—that never said this. And they're like, "Oh, now it's sourced. It's here forever because nobody ever does their homework." "And we're <span id="ent-org-wikipedia-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/org-wikipedia.md">Wikipedia</a></span>. We're <a href="/entities/org-wikipedia.md">Wikipedia</a>." "So you can't question this, obviously." And then you can see the second citations that are used. September—the dates of them—<span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>, <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-05-03"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span>.

Maybe there wasn't any mention of <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-faith-t-00-05-47"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">Turning Point Faith</a></span> at all. And maybe what they did was afterwards <span id="ent-org-wikipedia-t-00-05-47"><a href="/entities/org-wikipedia.md">Wikipedia</a></span> editors went in there and wanted to just break apart every part and speak about <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> and dedicate more thorough research to the various projects that <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a> and <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-47"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> were working on. So they included a new tab about <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">Turning Point Faith</a>. If you're wondering that, that's fair, but the answer to that musing is no. ^t-00-05-47

In fact, that section is still available if you just scroll down. And it kind of conflicts with the new section that was added 36 hours later. It makes it clear that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-26"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> founded <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-faith-t-00-06-26"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">TPUSA Faith</a></span> alone. Here it is: "In 2021, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> founded <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa-faith.md">TPUSA Faith</a>, an organization that says it is dedicated to recruit pastors and other church leaders to be active in local and national political issues.<span id="event-event-2021-01-01-charlie-kirk-founded-turning-point-usa-f-t-00-06-26"><a href="/events/event-2021-01-01-charlie-kirk-founded-turning-point-usa-f.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>" "The organization promotes a culture war agenda and is intended to attract supporters among religious conservatives." ^t-00-06-26

Now, you can keep reading here. There's no mention of McCoy. So what this means practically is that when <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-07"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> was alive, that is what the <span id="ent-org-wikipedia-t-00-07-07"><a href="/entities/org-wikipedia.md">Wikipedia</a></span> read. And then he died and suddenly somebody in the world said, "Well, what about <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-07-07"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span>?" "Let's add <a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a>," who is not known worldwide. Okay, this is even before the memorial event. So you could maybe go, "Oh, well, maybe once he hit the stage and said, 'I'm <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s pastor,' somebody went in there and added it." I don't know, guys. My question is who made that update? Who was rather instructed to make that update? Because I can tell you how it works for big companies. ^t-00-07-07

Each year, <a href="/entities/org-riverbend-ranch.md">Riverbend Ranch</a> provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches.

Maybe you hesitated because you didn't want to give up your low mortgage rate that you're currently enjoying. Well, there's good news because they've now created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. And unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment, giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call <a href="/entities/org-american-financing.md">American Financing</a> today and start saving. ^t-00-24-51

Okay, the first thing that I want to say is that Don Jr. is not a bad guy. He's not a bad guy. Don Jr. is probably maybe akin in some ways to <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-35-31"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>. I look at <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>—I don't know <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a> at all—and I don't think he's an evil person. I think he is in the shadow of his father, right? I think he's in the shadow of his father. I think Don Jr. has been probably in the shadow of his father his entire life because what he's saying when he begins to credentialize himself and said, "Oh, I was out with the <span id="ent-gpe-wuhan-t-00-35-31"><a href="/entities/gpe-wuhan.md">Wuhan</a></span>.

And that's what I mean when I say someone who was in the shadow of his father, and it's a tough situation to be in.

They built one of the most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth, which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils, which means that your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Neemie has two products from their tallow line that you should know about first: your daily hydration. There's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light; it absorbs quickly, and it doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling. They've combined that tallow with soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil, which I love.

People said, "I haven't gone to church in 45 years, and after I watched <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-46-19"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> be assassinated, I knew that I needed to go to church." Don't ignore that, okay? You are not like a paper bag floating in the wind like Katy Perry's song said. You do have a spirit, and what you are pulling—everyone feels that we are in some sort of a spiritual battle now. You're starting to wake up. ^t-00-46-19

I mean, people are asking, "Do we live in a matrix?" "Do we live in a military industrial complex?" You recognize something is very wrong. Do not ignore your gut on that, okay? You do not descend from homo sapiens, australopithecus. That is not the story of man. That's not the story of man. That's not where you were from. Like I said, you have a spirit, and there is more. There is more. Of course there is more. Of course there is life after death, okay? And the idea that they want you to believe is, "No, no, no—this is it." "You're here for about 80 years, so you just better be selfish and allow us to enslave you here where we have dominion." ^t-00-47-04

That's not an expression. People—we have observed this—have literally sold their souls. They don't understand that. They won't understand that until they die or realize what that actually means. They don't understand that hell is for an eternity, okay? And how we got here—that the story of <span id="ent-person-saint-michael-t-00-47-45"><a href="/entities/person-saint-michael.md">St. Michael</a></span> leading the angels in heaven, the great battle in heaven, knocking Satan and the angels that were behind him down to the earth—that is all very real. And <a href="/entities/person-saint-michael.md">St. Michael</a> is a prayer of protection that I feel is very powerful. ^t-00-47-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg/t-00-48-28.md" class="timestamp-link">00:48:28</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt0VHV-POCg&t=2908" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It's a very powerful prayer that we say every Sunday at Mass. And I think that, you know, just the way it starts: "<span id="ent-person-saint-michael-t-00-48-28"><a href="/entities/person-saint-michael.md">St. Michael</a></span>, defend us in battle." "Be our protection against the wickedness and the snares of the <span id="ent-concept-devil-t-00-48-28"><a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a></span>." "May God rebuke him, we humbly pray." "And do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls." Amen. It's a powerful prayer. And we're there. We need protection, okay? But I do think that once again, goodness—light—is going to win. ^t-00-48-28

People in <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-49-12"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> had dreams. There was one young woman who emailed me and said, "<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-49-12"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, like, I just have to tell you, the week leading up to this, I had a very vivid dream about so-and-so at the company and six snakes that were around him." And I didn't know that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-49-12"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was going to be assassinated, and this person recounted their dream in detail. And there were many people who dreamed—for whatever reason—the number six was in their dreams in terms of the weapon; whatever it was, it was six—that was appearing. And so I'm kind of going by a vibe that there may be six people who betrayed him by the end of this because there was one too many dreams that affect—from people around the world. ^t-00-49-12

Anyway, some more comments that we have here. Max Hardy writes: "Hey, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-49-55"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, I'm 16 and homeschooled." "I watch every episode." "We are praying for your protection." "I just got Blackout the Book, Finishing the College Scam." "And then I will definitely have to get <span id="ent-person-josh-hammer-t-00-49-55"><a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a></span>'s book because <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-49-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> supported it and just wanted everybody to read it." No, of course—duh. Like, obviously. Are you kidding me? Like ASAP. It was basically his last words, right? And then, you know, that was what he said: "<a href="/entities/person-josh-hammer.md">Josh Hammer</a>, sell your book no matter what, man." Also on his list of instructions. Maria Garcia writes: "<a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>, what does it mean to be <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s David?" I think it probably means that we got to slay some Goliaths. May God bless you. Who knows? ^t-00-49-55

And I mean that with everyone. I just don't care. You don't get to do this. You don't get to force me to watch someone that I came up with catch a bullet in his throat and then tell me to shut up, okay? There's got to be rules here. You don't get to do this. And you're losing. You feel that, right? You feel the energy is not behind you. There's a reason for that. ^t-00-50-39

"A woman came up to me and called me brave and said, 'Good for you.'" "I love it." "In that moment, I was so proud to be on the side of truth." "Keep going and don't stop." "You are so supported." I know. I know that I am not supported by the people in suits.

I mean, I've seen a lot of your comments about like the show is not the same, and it's because nothing can survive when it is being choked by lies. And that's ultimately what I hope for these people. Going back to my point that I actually don't believe in the death penalty because it's too easy— for the people who didn't kill <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> but perhaps betrayed him before or after—because I feel like accepting this bogus narrative is an act of betrayal. I want these people to go through the rest of their lives—long lives. I want them to have long lives, actually. ^t-00-52-07

They can feel the energy of people knowing, "You too. We know." I want them to feel that energy. It doesn't matter who you are; it doesn't matter what promotion you get; what title you have; what chief you are. The people around you in every room you walk into know, right? They don't know, but they know. And that should mean everything.

"Nothing will harm you." Bayes writes: "The fact that they tried to pass that off as a wound from a .30-06 just tells us how stupid they think that we really are." They overestimated those Maxwell-published textbooks that they tried to indoctrinate us with. I'm glad people are waking up.

Timothy writes: "The effort to discredit you, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-54-13"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, for noticing so much is revealing."

Yeah, and the psychology of it is just painstaking, right? It's like, "If you care, you like porn." "If you care, you just want clicks." "If you care"—like trying to make us dirty. It's just nonsense. It's like I said: we have to steel ourselves against their psychology. These are like military psychological operations. It's why they need bots on the internet—which they're doing. As we learned, they're buying so many bots on the internet. It's a stake that <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-54-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> is taking. It's why they want <span id="ent-org-tiktok-t-00-54-55"><a href="/entities/org-tiktok.md">TikTok</a></span>—because they want you to feel that pressure that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-54-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> felt: like everyone thinks it's but you, so you feel isolated.

"So something's wrong with you." It's exact same thing here. No. Let me tell you something right now. We are the majority. It is so obvious to me.

Actually, it was a government initiative sponsored by the children of <span id="ent-concept-bolsheviks-t-00-56-19"><a href="/entities/concept-bolsheviks.md">Bolsheviks</a></span>, obviously.
