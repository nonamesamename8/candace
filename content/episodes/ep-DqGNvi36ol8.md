**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-00-00.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=0" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** All right, you guys, happy Friday. Welcome to the end of the week. Get excited because the rapper, <span id="ent-person-the-game-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-the-game.md">the game</a></span> has dropped his song entitled <span id="ent-work-the-assassination-of-candace-owens-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/work-the-assassination-of-candace-owens.md">The Assassination of Candace Owens</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-12-05-the-game-releases-song-the-assassination-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-05-the-game-releases-song-the-assassination.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>. And the lyrics are in fact fantastic because even the hip hop world is asking questions and noticing that <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">turning point</a></span> is not acting right. It's because you guys are just not acting right. Well, guess what? Something interesting has taken place this morning. <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a> confirmed that the debate request and the sit down request to respond to all of our very many questions actually came from <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span>. They said that request was directed by <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a> and I find that to be compelling. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-00-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=41" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And they also explained why it has to be in person. And I am curious to play that clip for you to see if you believe and accept their explanation, their reason why. Also, I have probably looked at more footage from <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span> than any human being in the government or otherwise<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve-t-00-00-41"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, anybody on this planet. And I happened to take note of something that I find to be quite strange. And I want to toss it to you guys because the public is more perceptive and capable than our FBI. So let's jump right into this. Welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-41"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. ^t-00-00-41

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-01-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=93" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, we're going to do something different and actually begin today's episode with comments from yesterday's episode because they are extremely, extremely relevant and they're also hilarious to what we're about to discuss. People who watch the show are obviously savages, absolute savages. And obviously yesterday we were discussing how they rescinded the offer because it had to be in person. Look at this comment, top comment. <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-01-33"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a></span> takes them three months to respond. Also <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a>, you have 24 hours to respond. Seriously, where did this 24 hour thing come from and why was it necessary? ^t-00-01-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-02-12.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:12</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=132" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The second comment, this user writes, <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-02-12"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> can appear in court by video conference, but <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-12"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> says <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-02-12"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> cannot attend their debate by similar means. Yeah, guys, we are starting to notice some things. It's weird. And we announced or it was announced today that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-12"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s show, which they are continuing and which once upon a time enjoyed the number one spot on <span id="ent-org-apple-t-00-02-12"><a href="/entities/org-apple.md">Apple</a></span> podcasts has now plummeted, right? This is a tweet breaking news. <span id="ent-work-the-charlie-kirk-show-t-00-02-12"><a href="/entities/work-the-charlie-kirk-show.md">The Charlie Kirk show</a></span> has crashed in the rankings falling to number 94 on <a href="/entities/org-apple.md">Apple</a> podcasts, even though it routinely held the top 10 spot in the past and even reached number one when Kirk was alive. The reason for that is simple. It is clear. ^t-00-02-12

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-02-57.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:57</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=177" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** People are telling you how they feel, and they feel that you are not being honest. They feel that they are not getting the truth from the very people who keep trying to market themselves as his closest friends. And I'm saying marketing intentionally because it feels as though they have transformed into a badly run PR firm from the early 2000s where you try to use celebrities to influence the public. You get like, you know, <span id="ent-person-britney-spears-t-00-02-57"><a href="/entities/person-britney-spears.md">Britney Spears</a></span>, <span id="ent-person-justin-timberlake-t-00-02-57"><a href="/entities/person-justin-timberlake.md">Justin Timberlake</a></span> to wear your denim. and everybody just then starts wearing denim, right? And I will add on to this that I, certainly myself, am compelled, I would say that it's an interesting twist in this debate story, if we're even calling it a debate offer, ^t-00-02-57

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-03-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=221" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** At least I was surprised. I was legitimately surprised to hear this morning that it was apparently <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span> who called for <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a></span> to formally respond to the mounting questions and to set the live stream. At least that's what <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span> is saying on <span id="ent-work-the-charlie-kirk-show-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/work-the-charlie-kirk-show.md">the Charlie Kirk show</a></span>. They received this morning phone calls from the viewers. at home and of course somebody asked about the nature of how they went about trying to get me onto this live stream. Let's take a listen to that question being asked I think from a woman named Gina. Let's take a listen. ^t-00-03-41

Gina, welcome to <span id="ent-work-the-charlie-kirk-show-t-00-04-20"><a href="/entities/work-the-charlie-kirk-show.md">the Charlie Kirk show</a></span>. What's your question? ^t-00-04-20

And I'm trying to make it all come together. I'm sure I'm not your only fan that is trying to do that because of the relationship that she had with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-31"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. And one thing that I'm just trying to make come together in my head is fly. The invitation was extended to <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>, but not to <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> directly. <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-04-31"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake</a></span>, I think you tweeted something out and I don't know if you know. I don't know what's truth and what's not, but I do know that she said she didn't. She didn't even see the invitation and it was issued <a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake</a>. ^t-00-04-31

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-05-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=313" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Caller (Gina):** I think at 12 on a tweet that you had, but or midnight 12 not noon midnight. And so it was like 9 hours later before she even knew that you said anything about her attending the show. She's saying she can't attend in person. Can she attend on a live stream or, you know, and you guys do live streams all the time. And is that going to be an option? I'm just trying to make this come together. ^t-00-05-13

**🎤 Blake Neff**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-05-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=337" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** Of course, Gina. So first of all, our initial statement, it was on the show on Wednesday. I made it at the request of <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-05-37"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-12-03-blake-neff-makes-initial-statement-on-ch-t-00-05-37"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-blake-neff-makes-initial-statement-on-ch.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>. All of this has been At the direction and approval of of <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> because she heads this and so we what we were announcing there is we said she has said things that are not true and we did not address them for a long time. We stated the reasons why that we thought a lot of them were just not. We had to put it. ^t-00-05-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-06-12.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:12</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=372" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** We initially just thought no one would believe a lot of what was being said and we also just, we remembered the same friendship that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-12"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> had and we just hoped that this would go away without requiring any sort of direct statement or confrontation from us. So what was approved is we announced we are going to respond to this and what I said was we are going to announce a date soon. We actually hadn't agreed on it at the time I read the statement. We're going to announce a date where we're going to respond to this and once we announce it, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-06-12"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> is free to attend in person. That is what we announced. And so once we agreed on a time, I announced what the time was going to be. <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>, for her part, had said, you name the time, you name the place. That is what we did. ^t-00-06-12

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-06-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=415" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** As for why it was put out at that time, I would just say, I don't think she had any difficulty in finding out what our scheduled time was. It seems everyone found it out quite quickly. And lastly, on the point of why it's in person, I think it's pretty intuitive that given what is being said, what the way this has worked is that it's critical to be in person if you want to be authentic and to be detailed. And that is what we think is a fair request to make if she's going to participate. But regardless, it is going to go forward because we have agreed<span id="event-event-2025-12-15-turning-point-usa-scheduled-a-live-streamed-formal-t-00-06-55"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-15-turning-point-usa-scheduled-a-live-streamed-formal.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> that some response needs to be made. ^t-00-06-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-07-38.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:38</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=458" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** And so that's going to happen when we announced it on <span id="ent-date-december-15th-t-00-07-38"><a href="/entities/date-december-15th.md">December 15th</a></span>. And we actually got to hit it. I'm one person. But yeah, Gina, I'm sorry, we got to hit a radio break here. We can keep going in the in the break if you want for if you have a follow up. We will be right back. We're going to take a break from radio. We'll be right back. ^t-00-07-38

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-08-01.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:01</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=481" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I love situational irony like that, where he is actually live streaming with <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-08-01"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span>. It's like, it's not authentic unless it's a person is in person and <a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a> is literally not in person as he's answering his questions. So I guess the show is not authentic or something. I also love <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-08-01"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake</a></span> because he's trying so hard not to be condescending in that bit. It doesn't come naturally to him. He's extremely condescending. His obvious, how do I say this? We're shocked that you guys believe <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-08-01"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. We're just very shocked, you dummies. ^t-00-08-01

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-08-34.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:34</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=514" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And his excuse is that the reason he did this in the middle of the night on X is that that's it's to be expected as if that's some sort of normal etiquette. Once you extend an offer, not only do you extend an offer, you say that it's a sincere offer. He used the word sincere. And when she is trying to get around to, hey, like, why does this need to be in person? Just to be clear, <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-08-34"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake</a></span> is saying the answer to that is, quote unquote, it's intuitive that it is critical to be in person if you want to be authentic. Let me just run that sentence again because I consider myself to be pretty intuitive. ^t-00-08-34

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-09-17.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:17</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=557" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I am intuiting right now that that is absolute bull crap. He says, quote, it's intuitive that it is critical to be in person if you want to be authentic. Yeah, mm-hmm. They think you're stupid. They just think you're absolutely an idiot. And he says that that's fair. What are you talking about? My most contentious and my most viral debates have never been in person. Everyone assumes that when you extend an invite that you're gonna do whatever you can to make it happen, whether it's friendly, whether it's not friendly. When you say, and when you come out and you say that you are live streaming, the assumption is that you are live streaming because you want the internet to be able to attend, right? ^t-00-09-17

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-09-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=598" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That's the whole purpose and function of live streaming an event is that it invites everybody to be able to attend. So when you extend an invitation of live streaming and you don't explicitly say it must be in person, why would I assume that you're going to rescind the offer if I say that I can appear via live stream? Okay, they never said that when they made the offer, and they were pretending that they were being sincere, they never made in person a point of their demands. They never also said that I had to respond within 24 hours. That's a hostage situation. Okay, there's no way that I could have accommodated all that. in a million years, 24 hours to respond. ^t-00-09-58

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-10-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=637" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** How about, hmm, let me see if I can make that work, even if I could have made it work, which I couldn't have, because my husband instantly said, no, you cannot do this Monday. And he runs the household, and he has an important thing going on that day, which involves people that are coming in from overseas. But even if I could have made that work, I would not have within 24 hours have confirmed to them if they had even sent me an email, because I have kids, I would have had organize things, and it would have just taken longer than 24 hours, and they knew that. What <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-10-37"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake</a></span> did say verbatim on that day is, quote, here is what is going to happen. In the near future, there will be a live stream here in <span id="ent-gpe-phoenix-t-00-10-37"><a href="/entities/gpe-phoenix.md">Phoenix</a></span>.

We plan to walk through everything carefully and thoroughly. If <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-11-19"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> is available, we would sincerely welcome her participation in that live stream at our studio in <span id="ent-gpe-phoenix-t-00-11-19"><a href="/entities/gpe-phoenix.md">Phoenix</a></span>. not a demand to be there in person, live streams happening at your studio, and you said that this was a sincere request, then you went about it in the opposite manner, which is why it makes it really interesting that he says in the beginning that that was done at the request, at the direction, and with the approval of <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-11-19"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>.

Are we still going through a transition phase? Is she still learning the part? How involved is she on a day-to-day basis? Because some of these actions seem like fumbles, like absolute fumbles, and you're wondering, is <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-12-03"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span> running things? Is <span id="ent-person-tyler-bowyer-t-00-12-03"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-bowyer.md">Tyler Bowyer</a></span> running things? Is this coming from <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-12-03"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span>? Because I don't... I'm having trouble, I guess, comprehending why she would green a light, something that the internet has now read as incredibly insincere. Of course it's insincere. ^t-00-12-03

I asked this question so innocently, I was like, to someone at <a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a>, I was like, oh, are your school colors maroon? And he comes back and he said, no, they're green and white. So my gut told me, okay, that's interesting because maroon is not exactly a highly ranked color for men. Okay. And it can't be that all of these men that are wearing maroon also happen to have attended this event alone. So I'm going to show you what I mean. I'm going to go back to some of these people. This is by no means everyone. I'm just showing you a few times here. Here we go, we have this young man. This is after the shot. He's wearing maroon. ^t-00-20-10

We're gonna come back to the guy at the top there. who has the hat, the darker hat on, who's wearing maroon, just like these, like, strapping young men all wearing maroon. We've got this guy in the bush wearing maroon. I could go on and on, this person wearing, of how many people wearing maroon. I even have a video of someone holding a maroon shirt, okay? So I mentioned that quite casually, and that thing happened where there was an overreaction for no reason online, so I knew that I was on the right track, and I should probably keep going. ^t-00-20-52

We are retired now. The maroon color in the military means the color is famously associated with military forces such as the Maroon Beret of airborne troops around the world. And another person explained to me that especially in coordinated violent scenes, making sure that people are in certain colors or in something that is identifiable is important so that military men can observe who to protect or who they're looking for, right?

And I feel even more compelled because there was this person on <span id="ent-org-tiktok-t-00-22-59"><a href="/entities/org-tiktok.md">TikTok</a></span> you may have seen at the time who was claiming that he had some videos that someone in his family had shot.

I think I had shown you that. I'm going to show it to you again. I know I identified him as a young man named <span id="ent-person-jacob-kasparian-t-00-23-36"><a href="/entities/person-jacob-kasparian.md">Jacob Kasparian</a></span>, and I'm going to show you that video of him not ducking after the shot goes off.

I do not think he's shot. <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-24-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> because it's really fashionable for people to say that we are accusing everyone of shooting <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>. No, I am observing some things that strike me as unusual. And it's unusual that he attended the event alone. It is unusual to me that after researching him, he had posted himself earlier that day at either 8.42 AM or 7.42 AM. I'm unclear on whether or not Facebook is editing the time zones according to what I'm in, the times when I'm in or when it was shot. But he's wearing an entirely different shirt earlier that day.

He's up high and then he's at the lower rung. Two minutes before <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-25-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> gets shot, he's not where he is. And then the next thing you know, he's there. And the reason why he's not moving is because he's recording and he doesn't duck. And I just found that to be a bit interesting. I can show you, by the way, this is a very grainy image of him recording. We're kind of circling it there. It's okay if you can't see it. We've hyperimposed. But I just found it odd thereafter that nobody, despite him being there, witnessing it and having recorded, by the way, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> getting shot, none of his family members posted anything about trolley assassination. He is active. He did not post about trolley assassination. ^t-00-25-01

It was a global event. No comment whatsoever that I could find. And I started to wonder, based on where I found these individuals in the audience, I started to suspect, and this is my broader suspicion and theory, which in any investigation you're allowed to do, it might turn out to be wrong, but I am beginning to suspect that our maroon boys in general were tasked with taking footage from predetermined angles. Again, it's a suspicion. I'd like to explore it. And the easiest way for me to explore things and rule things out is to open things up to the public. ^t-00-25-44

His name is <span id="ent-person-adam-bartholomew-t-00-26-18"><a href="/entities/person-adam-bartholomew.md">Adam Bartholomew</a></span>.

Yeah, that only makes it more compelling because you were capturing footage on that day. So I'd like to know more.

Because literally he's recording him at 1223, right? He said, no, I didn't see him take the shot. I never saw any recoil. This guy has experience in guns. He teaches people to shoot guns. And he said, and I did not say that that was remember he told us early on. That's not the person that I saw. I saw somebody in tactical gear.
