**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-00-00.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=0" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** All right, you guys, happy Friday. Welcome to the end of the week. <span id="claim-claim-fa567dbd4181-t-00-00-00">Get excited because the rapper, <span id="ent-person-the-game-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-the-game.md">the game</a></span> has dropped his song entitled The Assassination of Candace Owens<a href="/claims/claim-fa567dbd4181.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. And the lyrics are in fact fantastic because even the hip hop world is asking questions and noticing that <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">turning point</a></span> is not acting right. It's because you guys are just not acting right. Well, guess what? Something interesting has taken place this morning. <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">TPUSA</a> confirmed that the debate request and the sit down request to respond to all of our very many questions actually came from <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span>. They said that request was directed by <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a> and I find that to be compelling. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-00-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=41" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And they also explained why it has to be in person. And I am curious to play that clip for you to see if you believe and accept their explanation, their reason why. Also, I have probably looked at more footage from September 10th than any human being in the government or otherwise<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-assassination-at-utah-valle-t-00-00-41"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-assassination-at-utah-valle.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>, anybody on this planet. And I happened to take note of something that I find to be quite strange. And I want to toss it to you guys because the public is more perceptive and capable than our FBI. So let's jump right into this. Welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-41

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-01-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=93" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, we're going to do something different and actually begin today's episode with comments from yesterday's episode because they are extremely, extremely relevant and they're also hilarious to what we're about to discuss. People who watch the show are obviously savages, absolute savages. And obviously yesterday we were discussing how they rescinded the offer because it had to be in person. Look at this comment, top comment. TPUSA takes them three months to respond. <span id="claim-claim-d26d92442984-t-00-01-33">Also TPUSA, you have 24 hours to respond<a href="/claims/claim-d26d92442984.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. Seriously, where did this 24 hour thing come from and why was it necessary? ^t-00-01-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-02-12.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:12</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=132" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The second comment, this user writes, <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-02-12"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> can appear in court by video conference, but Turning Point USA says Candace cannot attend their debate by similar means. Yeah, guys, we are starting to notice some things. It's weird. And we announced or it was announced today that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-12"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s show, which they are continuing and which once upon a time enjoyed the number one spot on Apple podcasts has now plummeted, right? This is a tweet breaking news. <span id="claim-claim-321117d20ae7-t-00-02-12">The <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> show has crashed in the rankings falling to number 94 on Apple podcasts, even though it routinely held the top 10 spot in the past and even reached number one when Kirk was alive<a href="/claims/claim-321117d20ae7.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. The reason for that is simple. It is clear. ^t-00-02-12

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-02-57.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:57</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=177" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** People are telling you how they feel, and they feel that you are not being honest. They feel that they are not getting the truth from the very people who keep trying to market themselves as his closest friends. And I'm saying marketing intentionally because it feels as though they have transformed into a badly run PR firm from the early 2000s where you try to use celebrities to influence the public. You get like, you know, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake to wear your denim. and everybody just then starts wearing denim, right? And I will add on to this that I, certainly myself, am compelled, I would say that it's an interesting twist in this debate story, if we're even calling it a debate offer, ^t-00-02-57

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-03-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=221" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** At least I was surprised. <span id="claim-claim-75ea2460e9b9-t-00-03-41">I was legitimately surprised to hear this morning that it was apparently Erika Kirk who called for TPUSA to formally respond to the mounting questions and to set the live stream<a href="/claims/claim-75ea2460e9b9.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. At least that's what <span id="ent-person-blake-neff-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/person-blake-neff.md">Blake Neff</a></span> is saying on the Charlie Kirk show. They received this morning phone calls from the viewers. at home and of course somebody asked about the nature of how they went about trying to get me onto this live stream. Let's take a listen to that question being asked I think from a woman named Gina. Let's take a listen. ^t-00-03-41

Gina, welcome to the Charlie Kirk show. What's your question? ^t-00-04-20

**🎤 Caller (Gina)**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-04-27.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=267" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Caller (Gina):** Hey, thanks guys. Can you hear me okay? ^t-00-04-27

**🎤 Caller (Gina)**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-04-31.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:31</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=271" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Caller (Gina):** Okay, my heart's broken with the things that are going on with Candace. And I'm trying to make it all come together. I'm sure I'm not your only fan that is trying to do that because of the relationship that she had with Charlie. And one thing that I'm just trying to make come together in my head is fly. The invitation was extended to Candace, but not to Candace directly. Blake, I think you tweeted something out and I don't know if you know. I don't know what's truth and what's not, but I do know that she said she didn't. She didn't even see the invitation and it was issued Blake. ^t-00-04-31

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-05-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=313" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Caller (Gina):** I think at 12 on a tweet that you had, but or midnight 12 not noon midnight. And so it was like 9 hours later before she even knew that you said anything about her attending the show. She's saying she can't attend in person. Can she attend on a live stream or, you know, and you guys do live streams all the time. And is that going to be an option? I'm just trying to make this come together. ^t-00-05-13

**🎤 Blake Neff**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-05-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=337" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** Of course, Gina. So first of all, our initial statement, it was on the show on Wednesday. I made it at the request of Erika<span id="event-event-2025-12-03-blake-neff-makes-initial-statement-on-ch-t-00-05-37"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-03-blake-neff-makes-initial-statement-on-ch.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span>. All of this has been At the direction and approval of of Erika because she heads this and so we what we were announcing there is we said she has said things that are not true and we did not address them for a long time. We stated the reasons why that we thought a lot of them were just not. We had to put it. ^t-00-05-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-06-12.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:12</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=372" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** We initially just thought no one would believe a lot of what was being said and we also just, we remembered the same friendship that Charlie had and we just hoped that this would go away without requiring any sort of direct statement or confrontation from us. So what was approved is we announced we are going to respond to this and what I said was we are going to announce a date soon. We actually hadn't agreed on it at the time I read the statement. We're going to announce a date where we're going to respond to this and once we announce it, Candace is free to attend in person. That is what we announced. And so once we agreed on a time, I announced what the time was going to be. Candace, for her part, had said, you name the time, you name the place. That is what we did. ^t-00-06-12

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-06-55.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:55</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=415" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** As for why it was put out at that time, I would just say, I don't think she had any difficulty in finding out what our scheduled time was. It seems everyone found it out quite quickly. And lastly, on the point of why it's in person, I think it's pretty intuitive that given what is being said, what the way this has worked is that it's critical to be in person if you want to be authentic and to be detailed. And that is what we think is a fair request to make if she's going to participate. But regardless, it is going to go forward because we have agreed<span id="event-event-2025-12-15-tpusa-scheduled-live-stream-response-to--t-00-06-55"><a href="/events/event-2025-12-15-tpusa-scheduled-live-stream-response-to-.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> that some response needs to be made. ^t-00-06-55

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-07-38.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:38</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=458" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Blake Neff:** And so that's going to happen when we announced it on December 15th. And we actually got to hit it. I'm one person. But yeah, Gina, I'm sorry, we got to hit a radio break here. We can keep going in the in the break if you want for if you have a follow up. We will be right back. We're going to take a break from radio. We'll be right back. ^t-00-07-38

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-08-01.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:01</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=481" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I love situational irony like that, where he is actually live streaming with <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-08-01"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span>. It's like, it's not authentic unless it's a person is in person and <a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a> is literally not in person as he's answering his questions. So I guess the show is not authentic or something. I also love Blake (Blake Neff) because he's trying so hard not to be condescending in that bit. It doesn't come naturally to him. He's extremely condescending. His obvious, how do I say this? We're shocked that you guys believe Candace. We're just very shocked, you dummies. ^t-00-08-01

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-08-34.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:34</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=514" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And his excuse is that the reason he did this in the middle of the night on X is that that's it's to be expected as if that's some sort of normal etiquette. Once you extend an offer, not only do you extend an offer, you say that it's a sincere offer. He used the word sincere. And when she is trying to get around to, hey, like, why does this need to be in person? Just to be clear, Blake (Blake Neff) is saying the answer to that is, quote unquote, it's intuitive that it is critical to be in person if you want to be authentic. Let me just run that sentence again because I consider myself to be pretty intuitive. ^t-00-08-34

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-09-17.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:17</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=557" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I am intuiting right now that that is absolute bull crap. He says, quote, it's intuitive that it is critical to be in person if you want to be authentic. Yeah, mm-hmm. They think you're stupid. They just think you're absolutely an idiot. And he says that that's fair. What are you talking about? My most contentious and my most viral debates have never been in person. Everyone assumes that when you extend an invite that you're gonna do whatever you can to make it happen, whether it's friendly, whether it's not friendly. When you say, and when you come out and you say that you are live streaming, the assumption is that you are live streaming because you want the internet to be able to attend, right? ^t-00-09-17

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-09-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=598" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** That's the whole purpose and function of live streaming an event is that it invites everybody to be able to attend. So when you extend an invitation of live streaming and you don't explicitly say it must be in person, why would I assume that you're going to rescind the offer if I say that I can appear via live stream? Okay, they never said that when they made the offer, and they were pretending that they were being sincere, they never made in person a point of their demands. They never also said that I had to respond within 24 hours. That's a hostage situation. Okay, there's no way that I could have accommodated all that. in a million years, 24 hours to respond. ^t-00-09-58

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-10-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=637" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** How about, hmm, let me see if I can make that work, even if I could have made it work, which I couldn't have, because my husband instantly said, no, you cannot do this Monday. And he runs the household, and he has an important thing going on that day, which involves people that are coming in from overseas. But even if I could have made that work, I would not have within 24 hours have confirmed to them if they had even sent me an email, because I have kids, I would have had organize things, and it would have just taken longer than 24 hours, and they knew that. What Blake (Blake Neff) did say verbatim on that day is, quote, here is what is going to happen. In the near future, there will be a live stream here in Phoenix. So we're assuming they're live streaming from Phoenix. ^t-00-10-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-11-19.md" class="timestamp-link">00:11:19</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=679" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** where we address in a clear and comprehensive way the claims and the accusations, the false accusations that have been made against Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s family, friends, and the people here at Turning Point. We plan to walk through everything carefully and thoroughly. If Candace is available, we would sincerely welcome her participation in that live stream at our studio in Phoenix. not a demand to be there in person, live streams happening at your studio, and you said that this was a sincere request, then you went about it in the opposite manner, which is why it makes it really interesting that he says in the beginning that that was done at the request, at the direction, and with the approval of Erika (Erika Kirk). And that's interesting for a lot of reasons. ^t-00-11-19

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-12-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=723" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** A, I think a lot of us have been wondering, like, did she take on this role and she's actually executing? Are we still going through a transition phase? Is she still learning the part? How involved is she on a day-to-day basis? Because some of these actions seem like fumbles, like absolute fumbles, and you're wondering, is Andrew Kolvet running things? Is Tyler Bowyer running things? Is this coming from Erika Kirk? Because I don't... I'm having trouble, I guess, comprehending why she would green a light, something that the internet has now read as incredibly insincere. Of course it's insincere. ^t-00-12-03

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-12-38.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:38</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=758" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** You know, you market yourself as somebody that is passionate about family, and we can't even get 24 hours to see if we can make things work and exchange things. Like, that doesn't feel honest. That didn't come across as honest. And you're telling us, or we're assuming from that statement that she approved the statement that went out referring to people as Antifa members, like making us akin to a basket of deplorables because we don't accept the fed slop, like that got her approval to go out. Like this was read by Erika (Erika Kirk). That doesn't feel good, you know? And the reality is, ^t-00-12-38

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-13-15.md" class="timestamp-link">00:13:15</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=795" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** is if you deeply care about the legacy of Turning Point USA as you all claim that you do, like you claim that you're really just in this, Blake Neff and Andrew (Andrew Kolvet) Kovac, because we were his best friends and we love him, then how can you treat people who are genuinely people just like Gina, donors to Turning Point USA, people who got behind Turning Point USA, people who have photos of them going to Turning Point USA events who probably have tickets to go to AmFest, how can you treat people with such contempt? How could you think they're dumb enough to believe that that was a sincere offer, that that's how it's supposed to work, that that's ever in the history ever of people setting up debates, that that's ever been how it's worked, that someone just arbitrarily picks a time and a place. ^t-00-13-15

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-13-59.md" class="timestamp-link">00:13:59</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=839" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And you admit you had no time and you did not have a date picked. So there's no reason you couldn't come to me and say, here's two dates that could work and allowed me to do that. And by the way, I would still like for you guys to do that. Okay? And one more thing I want to put out there, because your 24 hour demands is ridiculous. It's silly. Okay, let's strip it. Let's stop pretending that I, there's some buzzard that got hit. We can still make this work. And I would like to make this work. And I would especially like to make this work if you are saying or implying that Erika Kirk is going to be there. Because the reality is, that would be a game changer. I think that's a game changer. ^t-00-13-59

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-14-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:14:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=877" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I think it would be very powerful to have her there to represent the viewpoints in a way that they're maybe not being shared by Blake Neff, who is incredibly unlikable. and speaks down to people. And I don't know why he does that. It's not coming across clearly from your spokesperson, Andrew (Andrew Kolvet) Kolvet, who seems to be on the road and isn't course correcting in the attitudes that are coming out or at least telling people not to be like late night tweeting like Tyler Bowyer. And yeah, it would be great if you are saying that on the 15th, Erika Kirk, as you are insinuating that she's gonna be there, Right? She's directing this thing. ^t-00-14-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-15-21.md" class="timestamp-link">00:15:21</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=921" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Are you implying here that she's going to actually be in the chair and she's willing to allow me to bring things and to go over timelines and stuff? Like, can you make that offer through the proper channels? Can you actually say that since you now have more details about how it's going to work? and reopen that offer again, there is no way in hell that George can make the 15th work. I just said it now, he shut it down immediately, and for a very valid reason. And it is not my inclination to go to Phoenix without having my team with me. And my husband is very much a part of my team. ^t-00-15-21

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-DqGNvi36ol8/t-00-16-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:16:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqGNvi36ol8&t=963" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** but I will say that I will raise it further with the Supreme Court of George Farber if you are insinuating and actually if you can confirm that you are saying that you will allow me, as you said further in this, to bring whatever it is because it would be more authentic if it was face to face.

Now, it is actually common sense that has been guiding this investigation the entire time, despite the federal insistence that we pretend we don't have any. And I think there's a compelling element that we should follow here. If we believe and know and have the intuition that this is a deep state assassination? I do, okay? And we know that our deep state, the CIA, is involved in color revolutions all around the world. We should think about how they organize the revolutions, right? What does it actually entail? ^t-00-16-48

It has to look organic. to the untrained eye, you have to actually make sure that people will believe when they read the New York Times, when they read AP News or Reuters, that all of this just happened.

And we got our color revolution and we've been doing corrupt stuff in that region since now. I began scanning the people of the crowd obsessively, obviously. You should see the folders on my desktop.

I asked this question so innocently, I was like, to someone at UVU, I was like, oh, are your school colors maroon? And he comes back and he said, no, they're green and white. So my gut told me, okay, that's interesting because maroon is not exactly a highly ranked color for men. Okay. And it can't be that all of these men that are wearing maroon also happen to have attended this event alone. So I'm going to show you what I mean. I'm going to go back to some of these people. This is by no means everyone. I'm just showing you a few times here. Here we go, we have this young man. This is after the shot. He's wearing maroon. ^t-00-20-10

Show you another person here. We're gonna come back to this person who is wearing maroon because his dad is going to say something publicly. Three people, one shot, all of them alone wearing maroon. We're gonna come back to the guy at the top there. who has the hat, the darker hat on, who's wearing maroon, just like these, like, strapping young men all wearing maroon. We've got this guy in the bush wearing maroon. I could go on and on, this person wearing, of how many people wearing maroon. I even have a video of someone holding a maroon shirt, okay? So I mentioned that quite casually, and that thing happened where there was an overreaction for no reason online, so I knew that I was on the right track, and I should probably keep going. ^t-00-20-52

We are retired now. The maroon color in the military means the color is famously associated with military forces such as the Maroon Beret of airborne troops around the world. And another person explained to me that especially in coordinated violent scenes, making sure that people are in certain colors or in something that is identifiable is important so that military men can observe who to protect or who they're looking for, right?

You guys are so obvious, okay? It's the overreaction to simple things. And I feel in my gut that it was not some random coincidence that so many of these fellas decided to wear maroon on September 10th and attend the Charlie Kirk event. And I feel even more compelled because there was this person on TikTok you may have seen at the time who was claiming that he had some videos that someone in his family had shot. And when he submitted them to the FBI, the FBI, had asked him to delete that footage. And I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's false. ^t-00-22-59

I do not think he's shot. Charlie Kirk because it's really fashionable for people to say that we are accusing everyone of shooting Charlie Kirk. No, I am observing some things that strike me as unusual. And it's unusual that he attended the event alone. It is unusual to me that after researching him, he had posted himself earlier that day at either 8.42 AM or 7.42 AM. I'm unclear on whether or not Facebook is editing the time zones according to what I'm in, the times when I'm in or when it was shot. But he's wearing an entirely different shirt earlier that day.

He's up high and then he's at the lower rung. Two minutes before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) gets shot, he's not where he is. And then the next thing you know, he's there. And the reason why he's not moving is because he's recording and he doesn't duck. And I just found that to be a bit interesting. I can show you, by the way, this is a very grainy image of him recording. We're kind of circling it there. It's okay if you can't see it. We've hyperimposed. But I just found it odd thereafter that nobody, despite him being there, witnessing it and having recorded, by the way, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) getting shot, none of his family members posted anything about trolley assassination. He is active. He did not post about trolley assassination. ^t-00-25-01

It was a global event. No comment whatsoever that I could find. And I started to wonder, based on where I found these individuals in the audience, I started to suspect, and this is my broader suspicion and theory, which in any investigation you're allowed to do, it might turn out to be wrong, but I am beginning to suspect that our maroon boys in general were tasked with taking footage from predetermined angles. Again, it's a suspicion. I'd like to explore it. And the easiest way for me to explore things and rule things out is to open things up to the public. ^t-00-25-44

And it was even more compelling because there was this guy who live streamed the whole event. We all know who I'm speaking about. His name is Adam Bartholomew. I have never ever said anything about Adam Bartholomew. I have reviewed his footage, but people online were clocking him as suspicious. They're like, this guy just always happened to be in the right place at the right time. And he has been randomly attacking me. Again, I've never said anything about him. ^t-00-26-18

And he said, my son was wearing maroon on that day. And his son was. That's the person that we showed you. That's Adam and that's his son. Yeah, that only makes it more compelling because you were capturing footage on that day. So I'd like to know more. And I also find it strange, I will say about Adam Bartholomew, that when the shot rings out, he's live streaming, okay? And he does not stop live streaming to run down and ensure that his wife, who was in the audience, okay? was okay. ^t-00-27-00

Okay, I'm gonna read this to you guys. So, he says, let that woman speak her truth and I will love her like my mama, love her like Kamala, love her like Obama. Truth is, truth hurts, it's like a neck shot who really killed Charlie Kirk, okay? That is the truth, the truth does hurt and people wanna know who killed Charlie Kirk. This next line is just absolutely, I think, destructive to Turning Point USA as an organization. He goes on and he writes, his body is not yet settled in the dirt. Why are you carrying on like that? Are you an Andre 3000 verse? Okay, so that's a reference to Outkast and they are known for making their verses really long. They're very lyrical and poetic. ^t-00-34-58

How are you guys just going on? Like in Andre 3000 verse, who killed Charlie Kirk? That to me is the ultimate referendum on what Turning Point USA is doing. It literally, even a blind man can see what we are all seeing and yet you're trying to gaslight us into pretending like it's just all regular and that we are the bad guys. He goes on and he says, we live in an era where I can't say the N words, twerk. And we live in an era where they pull wallets up out they purse. But I was raised in Zion and not as I am. And if I'm lying low, throw me in a den with the lions and five YNs. I think that's a gang. ^t-00-35-40

Either way, behind these bars is shots fly in. Decapitate you sold called goats without trying. Go head to head with CNN while bumping CNN. Leave in France, I'm still alive. Some I won't see again. Seek my truth until I'm in the position that she is in. Moral to the story, be cautious who you believe in. I love this. It's so great. I love that he incorporated France into this and what he's saying obviously is like you have to fight these so-called goats and honestly they are like Baphomet worshipers, okay? The goat thing is, I get what he's doing here. He is being punny in all the right ways. And you, somehow by speaking the truth, you become a threat and they want to kill you.

And he's saying all of this to say, We're all going, like we all should be putting ourselves in this position to speak the truth. And the moral of the story is that we should be very cautious in who we believe in. And I think that that is how we all are feeling right now. Like we are suddenly recognizing that these, this authority is arbitrary, kind of the most grotesque perverse humans that you could possibly imagine.

Can you guys please just leave kids alone? And our government's like, mm-mm. Can't do that, sorry. Could you please just not poison us? Government's like, mm-mm. Sorry, we can't do that. You guys are asking for way too much. You're listening to too much Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens. It's too much for you guys.

So anyways, if you guys would like to toss him some support and just to appreciate that we're at a moment where hopefully when he says like, I was raised listening to Nas, what he means is like real hip hop, right? And people that were actually commenting on the state of things in an intellectual way. It's actually why I loved Jay-Z's music when I was growing up and I kind of hated what he became.

Like we are all slaves and they give us products and iPhones and flat screen TVs and Hollywood and the Kardashians and we're supposed to think that that's glamour and it's glitz and that means that we're in a golden era. Nope, nope, nope, I think that There was not an enlightenment, but there was a darkening of mankind, and America's gonna have to wake up real quick. So thank you for putting Charlie Kirk, memorializing him in that song to the game. Hopefully, next time you do it, I can be on the verse. Just like maybe just one little expression from this podcast.

You know, it's like they think it's like the world against them and the world could not have been more behind them when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. So if you have lost favor with the world, I'm talking about the organization, by the way, not obviously his kids and Erika (Erika Kirk), ^t-00-52-20

And this organization, in my view, has become completely delusional. So there's that. I'm not going to mince words, least of all, because I want an organization that isn't staying true to their own principles of free speech and inquiry to do well. The ghost of Charlie Kirk, that's not an appetizing enough of an offer. to make me stand behind an organization that no longer seems to be engaged in telling the truth. ^t-00-52-57
