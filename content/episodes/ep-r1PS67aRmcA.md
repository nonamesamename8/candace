I wanna report a blood libel, blood libel. I've suffered a centuries-old anti-Black trope. That's how this works, right? Like, if you're in the pro-<span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> lobby and you deal with any sort of pushback or flak, you gotta fall to the ground and cry victim. Well, it's my turn now, you guys, because yesterday<span id="event-event-1967-06-08-israel-attacks-uss-liberty-falsely-blamed-on-egypt-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-1967-06-08-israel-attacks-uss-liberty-falsely-blamed-on-egypt.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben Shapiro</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-11-08-eric-and-lara-trump-speak-at-recent-tpusa-event-at-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-11-08-eric-and-lara-trump-speak-at-recent-tpusa-event-at.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> (<a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben Shapiro</a>), who was invited as a guest to join <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a></span> on her tour, he pretty much just goes mask off, and it's obviously hilarious. He just lies. It's so weird. He just has nothing. So he lies and tries to pressure <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn</a> to respond to the lies. All I can say is the pro-<a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a> lobby is down real bad. They're writing fan fiction. They're like, it's like <a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Benjamin</a> <span id="ent-person-benjamin-netanyahu-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-benjamin-netanyahu.md">Netanyahu</a></span> fan fiction. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-00-44.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=44" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And on that note, I sat down with a woman on CNN, and it went about as bad as you might have expected. Fantastic clips that are making the rounds. So let's jump right back into this. Happy Friday, and welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. I don't know what to say other than it was the purest form of anti-Blackism that I've ever experienced. I mean, it's obvious to me that Ben <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-00-44"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Shapiro</a></span> is manifestly insane. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-01-26.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:26</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=86" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Last night, he was gripping the microphone as he would the neck of a Black woman. I'm kidding. Obviously, those are not my quotes. Those are actually direct quotations from Ben <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Shapiro</a></span> himself when he accuses others of anti-Semitism. Whenever he hears anything that he doesn't like about <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, those are actually his words. This is a real live tweet from Ben <a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Shapiro</a> accusing any American Jew who is pro-<a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a> first of a pure form of anti-Semitism. That was directed at Nick <span id="ent-person-nick-fuentes-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/person-nick-fuentes.md">Fuentes</a></span>, which we'll circle back to. Also, this was a real tweet directed at Ron <span id="ent-person-ron-paul-t-00-01-26"><a href="/entities/person-ron-paul.md">Paul</a></span>. "<a href="/entities/person-ron-paul.md">Ron Paul</a> is manifestly insane. As in previous debates, he is now gripping the pen as he would the neck of a Jew." ^t-00-01-26

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-02-10.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=130" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Ron <span id="ent-person-ron-paul-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-ron-paul.md">Paul</a></span>, really? And this is another tweet. "Perry had the memorable moments of the evening other than <a href="/entities/person-ron-paul.md">Ron Paul</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-ron-paul.md">Ron Paul</a>'s) corpse leaning forward from the grave and strangling the Jews." I don't know what's going on, man. I don't know what to say other than <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a></span> is a funny guy. He is. He's never trying to be funny. He just is funny when he's being serious, and he's being seriously angry about a topic. It's just something that I enjoy watching. And last night he got on stage with <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a></span>, and she had a tour stop in <span id="ent-gpe-florida-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-florida.md">Florida</a></span>. ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-02-49.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:49</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=169" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I wanna say, I was kind of impressed with <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-02-49"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a></span> because instead of doing his usual thing where he sends others to do his dirty work so he can keep his hands clean, he was like, I'm gonna peer pressure <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-02-49"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a></span> myself. I'm gonna make her disavow me, make her disavow <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-02-49"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span> (the host), I'm gonna make her disavow <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-02-49"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> by putting her on the spot and asking her to respond to things that <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a> never did and <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a> never did or said. And you really get to see it mask off because you saw this narrative circulating amongst people who were just absurdly making claims that I attacked <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-02-49"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>. And I know what these organic movements look like. I know how they operate behind the scenes. And I know <a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a> plays a part in this. ^t-00-02-49

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-03-33.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:33</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=213" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And so it was actually quite refreshing for me to be like, ah, now everyone gets to see what you are because you're saying stuff that never happened. So we'll start with what he said about <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>. You should know <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a></span> has a real thing for <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a>. I don't understand it. It is just, I don't know. It's been going on for a long time. There's something about <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> that gets under his skin. I'm not clear on it. I would actually love to hear <a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a> speak about that. I mean, people have a <a href="/entities/org-the-daily-wire.md">Daily Wire</a> non-compete when they're leaving <span id="ent-org-the-daily-wire-t-00-03-33"><a href="/entities/org-the-daily-wire.md">the Daily Wire</a></span>; they have to sign agreements that they're not going to go work for <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> for six months. It's strange. Anyways, he jumps into this, explaining his upset that, like, <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> left him on read. I don't know. ^t-00-03-33

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-04-12.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:12</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=252" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-04-12"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> and him had a nice conversation on the day that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-12"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> died, and <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> then sent a nice text because Ben had called him. And I guess <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-04-12"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a></span> thought there would be more of a follow-up, and there wasn't. So here is <a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a> complaining about that and then spinning it into the accusation that <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> somehow supports <span id="ent-person-zohran-mamdani-t-00-04-12"><a href="/entities/person-zohran-mamdani.md">Mamdani</a></span>. I don't know. Take a listen. (Clip: <a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben Shapiro</a>) ^t-00-04-12

**🎤 Ben Shapiro**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-04-34.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:34</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=274" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Ben Shapiro:** So I texted him, and I said, "Thanks so much for calling. It means the world. It truly does. Should we do a show together, talking about the <a href="/entities/org-democratic-socialists-of-america.md">DSA</a> threat, <span id="ent-org-democratic-socialists-of-america-t-00-04-34"><a href="/entities/org-democratic-socialists-of-america.md">Democratic Socialists of America</a></span> threat, and orienting in the same direction? Happy to do whatever it takes to bring everyone back together for the fight that matters." And <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-04-34"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> then wrote back, "Thanks, man. I appreciate it. I'm going to spend the next week or two thinking about how to be most effective. <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-04-34"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">The country</a></span> is clearly on the brink." I reached out repeatedly. After that, nothing happened. And again, I thought it was a good idea at the time. I think I felt differently after I saw what he did with Nick <span id="ent-person-nick-fuentes-t-00-04-34"><a href="/entities/person-nick-fuentes.md">Fuentes</a></span> and after he proceeded, in my opinion, to spend these subsequent weeks doing literally nothing to fight the left. ^t-00-04-34

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-05-14.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:14</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=314" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Ben Shapiro:** Again, I say this with sadness because <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-05-14"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> used to be, I think, a deeply important part of the conservative push to win. The number of times that <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> has mentioned Zohran <span id="ent-person-zohran-mamdani-t-00-05-14"><a href="/entities/person-zohran-mamdani.md">Mamdani</a></span> since <span id="ent-date-october-7th-t-00-05-14"><a href="/entities/date-october-7th.md">October 7th</a></span> on his show is once. And it was in the context of Marjorie Taylor <span id="ent-person-marjorie-taylor-greene-t-00-05-14"><a href="/entities/person-marjorie-taylor-greene.md">Greene</a></span> and <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> talking about the appeal of Zohran <a href="/entities/person-zohran-mamdani.md">Mamdani</a>. Just by way of contrast, not because I'm a perfect representative here, but because you've talked about Zohran <a href="/entities/person-zohran-mamdani.md">Mamdani</a> a lot, a lot of us have. Since <a href="/entities/date-october-7th.md">October 7th</a>, I did 17 separate shows on Zohran <a href="/entities/person-zohran-mamdani.md">Mamdani</a>, including four in the last week before the election. Because when you're orienting against the left, you really should orient against the left. So this just makes no sense. It makes entirely no sense. ^t-00-05-14

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-05-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=358" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He's upset because I guess <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-05-58"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span> doesn't want to do a show with him in the future. A lot of stuff goes on in the background that you guys don't understand. So, okay, that's on <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a>. If <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> doesn't want to collab with <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-05-58"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a></span>, that's on him. Also, it's <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a>'s) platform. So what it means when you have your own show, which I don't know why the shock is, is you can talk about whatever you want. If <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> wants to do six months and he just wants to cover sports, it's his prerogative, and people can tune in or they can tune out. That's what the free market means. The free market does not mean that the very same people who tried to artificially push <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> out of the market, the same people that applauded him being fired, the same people that have called him an anti-Semite, then get to dictate what he speaks about on his show. That actually just makes entirely no sense. It's not <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a>'s (<a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a>'s) responsibility. ^t-00-05-58

It's very strange. But to the insinuation that <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> somehow supported <a href="/entities/person-zohran-mamdani.md">Mamdani</a> and said like nice things about him when he sat down with Marjorie Taylor <span id="ent-person-marjorie-taylor-greene-t-00-06-42"><a href="/entities/person-marjorie-taylor-greene.md">Greene</a></span>, here's actually what <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a> said with Marjorie Taylor <a href="/entities/person-marjorie-taylor-greene.md">Greene</a>. And you be the judge of whether you think <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-06-42"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a></span> is being an honest person when he describes it in the manner that he just did.

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-07-09.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:09</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=429" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Tucker Carlson:** It's interesting. You said a second ago that when people are really frustrated when the system they live under fails them, they listen to voices that they shouldn't listen to or wouldn't listen to under any other circumstances. Like, how did Al <span id="ent-person-al-sharpton-t-00-07-09"><a href="/entities/person-al-sharpton.md">Sharpton</a></span> get to be the leader of Black <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-07-09"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span> or whatever? I mean, it's a thing. Desperate people tend to go to crappy leaders, I think. And I just can't get over what happened in our biggest city this week, the very same week that everybody in D.C. has focused thousands of miles away on the greatest threat we face, <span id="ent-gpe-iran-t-00-07-09"><a href="/entities/gpe-iran.md">Iran</a></span>'s nuclear program. I don't want <a href="/entities/gpe-iran.md">Iran</a> to have the bomb. I'm not pro-<a href="/entities/gpe-iran.md">Iran</a>, obviously. No, we're not pro-<a href="/entities/gpe-iran.md">Iran</a>.

But at the same time that everybody was looking to <span id="ent-gpe-iran-t-00-07-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-iran.md">Iran</a></span>, our largest city had a Democratic primary, effectively the mayor's race, and a 32-year-old socialist who wants government-run grocery stores gets elected. He's going to likely run our biggest city in <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-07-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">the country</a></span>. <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-t-00-07-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york.md">New York</a></span>. And it's like, why did that happen? Is it because people are so like desperate for government-run grocery stores or love socialism or love like foreign-born midwits running their cities? Probably not. That guy was the only person in the <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-city-t-00-07-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york-city.md">New York City</a></span> mayor's debate to say he wanted to focus on <a href="/entities/gpe-new-york-city.md">New York City</a>.

I think most said <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-08-31"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>. Great. And he said, I wouldn't go anywhere. I'd stay in <span id="ent-gpe-new-york-t-00-08-31"><a href="/entities/gpe-new-york.md">New York</a></span>. And if I want to meet Jewish constituents, I go to their synagogues, their homes, or whatever. But I'd be here in <a href="/entities/gpe-new-york.md">New York</a>, because that's what I'm doing. I'm running <a href="/entities/gpe-new-york.md">New York</a>. That's my job. Well, he gave the right answer. He gave the right answer. He gave the right answer, at least. And he's talking. I totally oppose his program. Absolutely. I don't think it works. But he's talking about economics, and everyone else is talking about foreign policy. So he said what I said. I am describing to you why <span id="ent-person-zohran-mamdani-t-00-08-31"><a href="/entities/person-zohran-mamdani.md">Mamdani</a></span> won, and you're angry that people are assessing why that happened. ^t-00-08-31

It's very obvious the fact that he was not focused on foreign policy issues when there's so many domestic ones to prove from. You got to learn why you lose elections, and it's not <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-09-09"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker Carlson</a></span>'s) job to get people elected, least of all in cities that he doesn't live in. Now, I wanna also show you what <span id="ent-person-ben-shapiro-t-00-09-09"><a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a></span> said about me because it's so outrageous and it's so dishonest that we actually should process what is happening here, okay? This is a watershed moment. <a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a> does not have it together; he is very insecure, and he's going on the attack against <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-09-09"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a></span> by lying about what I said and then forcing her to react to the evil of what I never said. ^t-00-09-09

Again, this is why I think you and I differ on our angle with regard to, for example, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-09-56"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span> (the host). I think that what <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a> (the host) is doing right now is evil. It is evil what she is doing right now. Okay, and I say that again. Because I didn't waffle on whether it's evil or not, but my position is it's really none of my business. And I have a question: What? Why is it none of your business? I mean, you comment on these things for a living. I'm not mother of the internet. No, but if this were on the left and somebody were accusing <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-56"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> of his wife having murdered him, I assume that you would be talking about it. Is that what <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> (<a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a>, the host) is accusing <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-09-56"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> of?

He's not even anywhere near what's happened. Anybody who's watched this show, I actually was getting flak from my audience for not covering <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a>'s (<span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a></span>'s) past or speaking about her parents. I said she gave one of the most consequential speeches, and I have focused my investigation on <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> and why they're telling certain lies. Seth <span id="ent-person-seth-dillon-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/person-seth-dillon.md">Dillon</a></span>, I told the truth that Seth <a href="/entities/person-seth-dillon.md">Dillon</a> lied about the <span id="ent-gpe-hamptons-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/gpe-hamptons.md">Hamptons</a></span> meeting and that he was pushing; he was pressuring <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> about the topic of <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-10-50"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>. I never once accused Seth <a href="/entities/person-seth-dillon.md">Dillon</a> of murdering <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. So what's he actually doing here, right? Obviously, there's a lot of layers that we should peel back, and it's important that we do it. The least interesting part of this is the fact that he's lying through his teeth. ^t-00-10-50

He's kind of like more of a behind-the-scenes person, and we're now watching him come undone in real time, because no matter who you are, in this age of digital media, it is simply not a good idea to lie through your teeth, okay? Wrong time, <span id="ent-date-2025-t-00-11-35"><a href="/entities/date-2025.md">2025</a></span>. Before you get the lie out, the internet is gonna clock it, right? They're gonna go back and be like, you lied. And when you do something like that, the blowback is gonna be on you. They're gonna go, actually, this now impacts your credibility. You said that <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> (<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-11-35"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace Owens</a></span>, the host) went out and said something about <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-11-35"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>.

I think they forfeit their ability to lead. I would never listen to somebody that can't say those things. 'Cause I mean, those things are really the foundation of wisdom, which is the love of God, which as you say, goes through the Son, as we all know, can only go through Jesus and oikophilia, which is, you know, your love of your home, your love of your homeland that you reside in, not some other homeland. So, I just want to get that across to you. It's kind of a strange circumstance that we're talking, but that's how I feel about it. ^t-00-14-38

So right after I've been fired, and I didn't know what Ben and Jeremy admitted that they did to him.

So we have to assume the story is true. And given what I know about what happens now, I think, and what <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-20-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was going through, I think we can all realize that Nick was an 18-year-old kid, like he told <span id="ent-person-tucker-carlson-t-00-20-55"><a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a></span>, and now the whole world knows this story. ^t-00-20-55

You should consider adding gold into your financial strategy. And I'll tell you why. Because when economies wobble, currencies can lose their value and markets can get scared. Gold does not always follow suit, though. Having some gold means that you're not 100% dependent on one system. You have something solid. What you do now can set a tone for later.

It's not that I'm like, I've known them. It's silly. I've been to their rallies. I've read all their texts. I get it. I know. I'm so glad you're educated.

Nobody said, "What do you mean by that?" Several times, she just, "What do you mean by they?" As if she didn't understand how to construct a basic sentence and to refer back to the noun. She had no idea which plural noun I was referring to. Anyways, I was not really in the mood and here is our conversation about "they." "They" is a word, so I don't need to always say "they." It's just a weird—this is one of these psychology tactics where you're like, "Who is they? Who is they?" And it's like—That sounds like you're saying Jews.

But if I'm not talking about Jews, then "they" doesn't mean Jews. When I say they want us to believe this or they want us to believe that and you hear Jews, that's your own derangement, right? If I want to say something about Jews, I'll say it. If I want to say something about <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-36-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>, I will say it.

You're getting stricter on anti-Semitism laws.

Dead on arrival now. And it's because you guys went for broke on <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-43-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span>. You know, whatever the real estate plan is in <span id="ent-gpe-gaza-t-00-43-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-gaza.md">Gaza</a></span>, that's going to be the <span id="ent-person-donald-trump-t-00-43-55"><a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Trump</a></span> legacy, I suppose. And to be honest, that wouldn't be the legacy that I'd want to have, because people are not going to forget what happened there. Your children's children are probably going to feel ashamed, to be honest with you, that you were involved in it. And that you defended it or that you stayed quiet about it because of money.

After everything that we've been through over the past five years, the number of people that are getting that flu shot is at a record low. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective at best, and that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is, of course, a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from <span id="ent-org-the-wellness-company-t-00-44-40"><a href="/entities/org-the-wellness-company.md">The Wellness Company</a></span>. If you wake up with a sore throat or runny nose, you can address those symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit containing ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, a generic Z-pack, and there's so much more as well. It's like having an urgent care center in your own home. I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from <a href="/entities/org-the-wellness-company.md">The Wellness Company</a> because I refuse to be trapped in line at an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. ^t-00-44-40

The kit is a lifesaver, a time saver. It's got thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So go to TWC.health/<span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-45-22"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> today and use code <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">CANDACE</a> to save $48.

And if you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before we know it, so don't wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today.

I'm mad at her because she's talking to the girl that I don't like. <a href="/entities/person-ben-shapiro.md">Ben</a>, please stop." I agree. There is something fundamentally high school about it. It's so weird. And I think they truly thought this was it. Like I know it's every week they renew their efforts to cancel <a href="/entities/person-tucker-carlson.md">Tucker</a>, but I think they thought they had him. Like this was really gonna be it.

And I think everybody should be in the free market. If Nick <a href="/entities/person-nick-fuentes.md">Fuentes</a> loses in the free market, I want it to be because there was better competition, not because he's just been artificially pushed out.

That's kind of weird that you're just jumping up and saying that it wasn't you. Amber Lee Fraz writes, "Let's not forget that he would be the one to pick up his bloodstained microphone." That is right. Ben did say that right after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-48-57"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> died. And even that, it was just for me knowing what was between them. It was just a lot for me to process. I was going through so many emotions that week. I was so angry. He was initial in the reaction to <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s death. It is obvious that he has an agenda. Look, everyone in politics has an agenda of some description. ^t-00-48-57

OK, and he knew I didn't say it.

And she's trying to come up for air. And she's like, wow, people are cheering this on.

Something was off. It was giving, you know, wine-drunk mom. Do you guys, did you used to watch Hey Arnold, like Helga Pataki's mom? Yeah. For those of you who use a very specific reference, but if you got it, you got it. It was giving Helga Pataki's mom. We watched such serious cartoons when we were growing up.

I don't think he's in on it, but persona non grata for years and then on like five major pods in the same month." Look, when I invited him on my podcast, genuinely, I just wanted to have a conversation so I can tell you, because I'm not an op, but the sense that I got with how he reacted and lied about how we treated him is the first thing that made me think he was an op, because I was like, that's so weird. ^t-00-50-24

Explorer253 writes, "Ben sounds like an immature teenage girl, upset that she can't control her friends or the people around her. How embarrassing." Yeah, and I just don't think it's gonna work. I think <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-51-04"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a></span> is going to hold the line because she did right there under pressure.

Who is they, Amber (Amber Lee Fraz)? When you say they, did you know? Did you know about that manual that was published in 1897? When you say they, it's a long-running anti-Semitic word, that word "they." So please be very clear if you plan on using it this weekend. ^t-00-51-48

Because her feelings are hurt, really. She studied it and she knows, she knows people. That's kind of the whole vibe she was giving was like mom drunk. Okay. Lastly, Jonathan (Jonathan) writes, "Compared the Islamic rules of engagement with the Geneva Convention.
