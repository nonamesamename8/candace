**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, 911. I wanna report a blood libel, blood libel. I've suffered a centuries-old anti-Black trope. That's how this works, right? Like, if you're in the pro-Israel lobby and you deal with any sort of pushback or flak, you gotta fall to the ground and cry victim. Well, it's my turn now, you guys, because yesterday Ben Shapiro, who was invited as a guest to join Megyn Kelly on her tour, he pretty much just goes mask off, and it's obviously hilarious. He just lies. It's so weird. He just has nothing. So he lies and tries to pressure Megyn to respond to the lies. All I can say is the pro-Israel lobby is down real bad. They're writing fan fiction. They're like, it's like Benjamin Netanyahu fan fiction. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=44" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:44</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-00-44.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And on that note, I sat down with a woman on CNN, and it went about as bad as you might have expected. Fantastic clips that are making the rounds. So let's jump right back into this. Happy Friday, and welcome back to Candace. I don't know what to say other than it was the purest form of anti-Blackism that I've ever experienced. I mean, it's obvious to me that Ben Shapiro is manifestly insane. ^t-00-00-44

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=86" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:26</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-01-26.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Last night, he was gripping the microphone as he would the neck of a Black woman. I'm kidding. Obviously, those are not my quotes. Those are actually direct quotations from Ben Shapiro himself when he accuses others of anti-Semitism. Whenever he hears anything that he doesn't like about Israel, those are actually his words. This is a real live tweet from Ben Shapiro accusing any American Jew who is pro-Israel first of a pure form of anti-Semitism. That was directed at Nick Fuentes, which we'll circle back to. Also, this was a real tweet directed at Ron Paul. "Ron Paul is manifestly insane. As in previous debates, he is now gripping the pen as he would the neck of a Jew." ^t-00-01-26

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=130" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-02-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Ron Paul, really? And this is another tweet. "Perry had the memorable moments of the evening other than Ron Paul's corpse leaning forward from the grave and strangling the Jews." I don't know what's going on, man. I don't know what to say other than Ben is a funny guy. He is. He's never trying to be funny. He just is funny when he's being serious, and he's being seriously angry about a topic. It's just something that I enjoy watching. And last night he got on stage with Megyn Kelly, and she had a tour stop in Florida. ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=169" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-02-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I wanna say, I was kind of impressed with Ben because instead of doing his usual thing where he sends others to do his dirty work so he can keep his hands clean, he was like, I'm gonna peer pressure Megyn Kelly myself. I'm gonna make her disavow me, make her disavow Candace Owens (the host), I'm gonna make her disavow Tucker (Tucker Carlson) by putting her on the spot and asking her to respond to things that Tucker Carlson never did and Candace Owens never did or said. And you really get to see it mask off because you saw this narrative circulating amongst people who were just absurdly making claims that I attacked Erika. And I know what these organic movements look like. I know how they operate behind the scenes. And I know Ben plays a part in this. ^t-00-02-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=213" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-03-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And so it was actually quite refreshing for me to be like, ah, now everyone gets to see what you are because you're saying stuff that never happened. So we'll start with what he said about Tucker (Tucker Carlson). You should know Ben has a real thing for Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I don't understand it. It is just, I don't know. It's been going on for a long time. There's something about Tucker (Tucker Carlson) that gets under his skin. I'm not clear on it. I would actually love to hear Ben speak about that. I mean, people have a Daily Wire non-compete when they're leaving the Daily Wire; they have to sign agreements that they're not going to go work for Tucker (Tucker Carlson) for six months. It's strange. Anyways, he jumps into this, explaining his upset that, like, Tucker (Tucker Carlson) left him on read. I don't know. ^t-00-03-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=252" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:12</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-04-12.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and him had a nice conversation on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) then sent a nice text because Ben had called him. And I guess Ben thought there would be more of a follow-up, and there wasn't. So here is Ben complaining about that and then spinning it into the accusation that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) somehow supports Mamdani. I don't know. Take a listen. (Clip: Ben Shapiro) ^t-00-04-12

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=274" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-04-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** So I texted him, and I said, "Thanks so much for calling. It means the world. It truly does. Should we do a show together, talking about the DSA threat, Democratic Socialists of America threat, and orienting in the same direction? Happy to do whatever it takes to bring everyone back together for the fight that matters." And Tucker (Tucker Carlson) then wrote back, "Thanks, man. I appreciate it. I'm going to spend the next week or two thinking about how to be most effective. The country is clearly on the brink." I reached out repeatedly. After that, nothing happened. And again, I thought it was a good idea at the time. I think I felt differently after I saw what he did with Nick Fuentes and after he proceeded, in my opinion, to spend these subsequent weeks doing literally nothing to fight the left. ^t-00-04-34

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=314" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-05-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Again, I say this with sadness because Tucker (Tucker Carlson) used to be, I think, a deeply important part of the conservative push to win. The number of times that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) has mentioned Zohran Mamdani since October 7th on his show is once. And it was in the context of Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) talking about the appeal of Zohran Mamdani. Just by way of contrast, not because I'm a perfect representative here, but because you've talked about Zohran Mamdani a lot, a lot of us have. Since October 7th, I did 17 separate shows on Zohran Mamdani, including four in the last week before the election. Because when you're orienting against the left, you really should orient against the left. So this just makes no sense. It makes entirely no sense. ^t-00-05-14

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=358" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-05-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** He's upset because I guess Tucker (Tucker Carlson) doesn't want to do a show with him in the future. A lot of stuff goes on in the background that you guys don't understand. So, okay, that's on Tucker (Tucker Carlson). If Tucker (Tucker Carlson) doesn't want to collab with Ben, that's on him. Also, it's Tucker's (Tucker Carlson's) platform. So what it means when you have your own show, which I don't know why the shock is, is you can talk about whatever you want. If Tucker (Tucker Carlson) wants to do six months and he just wants to cover sports, it's his prerogative, and people can tune in or they can tune out. That's what the free market means. The free market does not mean that the very same people who tried to artificially push Tucker (Tucker Carlson) out of the market, the same people that applauded him being fired, the same people that have called him an anti-Semite, then get to dictate what he speaks about on his show. That actually just makes entirely no sense. It's not Tucker's (Tucker Carlson's) responsibility. ^t-00-05-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=402" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-06-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Tucker (Tucker Carlson) doesn't live in New York City. It's not his responsibility to use his platform to speak about Mamdani 17 times. It's very strange. But to the insinuation that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) somehow supported Mamdani and said like nice things about him when he sat down with Marjorie Taylor Greene, here's actually what Tucker (Tucker Carlson) said with Marjorie Taylor Greene. And you be the judge of whether you think Ben is being an honest person when he describes it in the manner that he just did. Take a listen to Tucker (Tucker Carlson). (Clip: Tucker Carlson) ^t-00-06-42

**🎤 SPEAKER_3**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=429" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-07-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** It's interesting. You said a second ago that when people are really frustrated when the system they live under fails them, they listen to voices that they shouldn't listen to or wouldn't listen to under any other circumstances. Like, how did Al Sharpton get to be the leader of Black America or whatever? I mean, it's a thing. Desperate people tend to go to crappy leaders, I think. And I just can't get over what happened in our biggest city this week, the very same week that everybody in D.C. has focused thousands of miles away on the greatest threat we face, Iran's nuclear program. I don't want Iran to have the bomb. I'm not pro-Iran, obviously. No, we're not pro-Iran. Like, why do we have to say it? No, right. ^t-00-07-09

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=466" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-07-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** It's dumb. But at the same time that everybody was looking to Iran, our largest city had a Democratic primary, effectively the mayor's race, and a 32-year-old socialist who wants government-run grocery stores gets elected. He's going to likely run our biggest city in the country. New York. And it's like, why did that happen? Is it because people are so like desperate for government-run grocery stores or love socialism or love like foreign-born midwits running their cities? Probably not. That guy was the only person in the New York City mayor's debate to say he wanted to focus on New York City. All the candidates were asked, if you could visit a foreign country, what would it be? ^t-00-07-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=511" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:31</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-08-31.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_3:** And they all, of course, all had an answer. I think most said Israel. Great. And he said, I wouldn't go anywhere. I'd stay in New York. And if I want to meet Jewish constituents, I go to their synagogues, their homes, or whatever. But I'd be here in New York, because that's what I'm doing. I'm running New York. That's my job. Well, he gave the right answer. He gave the right answer. He gave the right answer, at least. And he's talking. I totally oppose his program. Absolutely. I don't think it works. But he's talking about economics, and everyone else is talking about foreign policy. So he said what I said. I am describing to you why Mamdani won, and you're angry that people are assessing why that happened. ^t-00-08-31

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=549" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:09</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-09-09.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Doesn't matter how many times you call somebody an anti-Semite; people appreciate it. It's very obvious the fact that he was not focused on foreign policy issues when there's so many domestic ones to prove from. You got to learn why you lose elections, and it's not Tucker's (Tucker Carlson's) job to get people elected, least of all in cities that he doesn't live in. Now, I wanna also show you what Ben said about me because it's so outrageous and it's so dishonest that we actually should process what is happening here, okay? This is a watershed moment. Ben does not have it together; he is very insecure, and he's going on the attack against Megyn Kelly by lying about what I said and then forcing her to react to the evil of what I never said. ^t-00-09-09

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=594" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-09-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Here's what Ben said. (Clip: Ben Shapiro) ^t-00-09-54

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=596" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-09-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** We're in a business where people comment on what we say publicly. Again, this is why I think you and I differ on our angle with regard to, for example, Candace Owens (the host). I think that what Candace Owens (the host) is doing right now is evil. It is evil what she is doing right now. Okay, and I say that again. Because I didn't waffle on whether it's evil or not, but my position is it's really none of my business. And I have a question: What? Why is it none of your business? I mean, you comment on these things for a living. I'm not mother of the internet. No, but if this were on the left and somebody were accusing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) of his wife having murdered him, I assume that you would be talking about it. Is that what Candace (Candace Owens, the host) is accusing Erika of? Yes, I of murdering her own husband? ^t-00-09-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=637" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-10-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** She's accusing TPUSA insiders and other members of the right wing, including Seth Dillon, of being involved in the murder of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Yes. I don't even know how to respond to it because it just never happened. ^t-00-10-37

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=650" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:50</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-10-50.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's so crazy. He's not even anywhere near what's happened. Anybody who's watched this show, I actually was getting flak from my audience for not covering Erika's past or speaking about her parents. I said she gave one of the most consequential speeches, and I have focused my investigation on Turning Point USA and why they're telling certain lies. Seth Dillon, I told the truth that Seth Dillon lied about the Hamptons meeting and that he was pushing; he was pressuring Charlie (Charlie Kirk) about the topic of Israel. I never once accused Seth Dillon of murdering Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So what's he actually doing here, right? Obviously, there's a lot of layers that we should peel back, and it's important that we do it. The least interesting part of this is the fact that he's lying through his teeth. ^t-00-10-50

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=695" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-11-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** That's implied he's a Zionist, but there's a lot more that's happening that meets the eye, because Ben Shapiro was effectively the final boss of the pro-Israel lobby, and it's because he never comes out and says what he means. He's kind of like more of a behind-the-scenes person, and we're now watching him come undone in real time, because no matter who you are, in this age of digital media, it is simply not a good idea to lie through your teeth, okay? Wrong time, 2025. Before you get the lie out, the internet is gonna clock it, right? They're gonna go back and be like, you lied. And when you do something like that, the blowback is gonna be on you. They're gonna go, actually, this now impacts your credibility. You said that Candace (Candace Owens, the host) went out and said something about Erika. By the way, you hear the people in the background going, "Woo!" I'm gonna tell you what's happening there too. ^t-00-11-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=739" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-12-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And you're gonna see how this thing really works. Point number one that I wanna make about how, why, or what Ben is doing right here is just the stunning hypocrisy of it, okay? The rules for thee and not for me. I am getting old. My memory is getting a little fuzzy, but I distinctly remember the week that I was gloriously fired from the Daily Wire. And during that week, the CEO of the Daily Wire, at the time it was Jeremy Boreing, jumped onto an X space hosted by Lauren Chen and had a conversation with Nick Fuentes where he sang Nick Fuentes's praises and also invited him onto the Daily Wire, okay? ^t-00-12-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=780" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-13-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Here's a headline because the Huffington Post remembers too: "Daily Wire CEO tells white supremacist Nick Fuentes that he's talented and he's very funny." The article goes on: during a live-streamed conversation with white supremacist Nick Fuentes last week, the CEO of the Daily Wire, a major right-wing media outlet, praised the prominent fascist influencer and offered only mild criticism about some of his political views, a stark difference from how he has spoken about Fuentes in the past. On March 25th, the Daily Wire CEO Jeremy Boreing joined Fuentes on X for a live audio chat room. ^t-00-13-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=815" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-13-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Boreing told Fuentes that he listens to Fuentes' show quite often and that he thinks Fuentes is quote-unquote "very funny" and one of the most talented political influencers, even if he is very concerned about some of what Fuentes says. Later in the discussion, Boreing said that he'd be thrilled to have Fuentes on one of the Daily Wire's shows to debate the media company's popular pundits, some of whom have millions of viewers. This happened. ^t-00-13-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=845" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:05</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-14-05.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So I want you just to remember this because I feel like people are not appreciating how hypocritical it is that he's now trying to struggle session Megyn Kelly, because all he had one test on the show when the Daily Wire position in 2024 was that their CEO could talk to Nick Fuentes publicly, praise Nick Fuentes publicly, and also invite Nick Fuentes onto the Daily Wire platform. We can actually, we should actually take a listen to a little bit of that conversation between Jeremy Boreing, then CEO of Daily Wire, and Nick Fuentes. (Clip: Jeremy Boreing and Nick Fuentes) ^t-00-14-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=878" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-14-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_4:** People can say, well, I don't like what you say about this and that. I don't like the guys like Shapiro cannot, will not say "Christ is King, America first." I think they forfeit their ability to lead. I would never listen to somebody that can't say those things. 'Cause I mean, those things are really the foundation of wisdom, which is the love of God, which as you say, goes through the Son, as we all know, can only go through Jesus and oikophilia, which is, you know, your love of your home, your love of your homeland that you reside in, not some other homeland. So, I just want to get that across to you. It's kind of a strange circumstance that we're talking, but that's how I feel about it. ^t-00-14-38

I think you're one of the most talented people out there. And I'm very concerned about some of the things that you're saying. I wish. I think that you're a very gifted communicator. And so it's hard for me to imagine that you consistently miscommunicate some of these things. I'll hope that I'm wrong and yield the floor back to all the people who actually came on here to talk to each other. ^t-00-15-11

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=936" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-15-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Anybody want to help me out why it's now different? What could be different now that it was okay when the Daily Wire was open to doing it and then Tucker (Tucker Carlson) did it and now it's suddenly not okay and it's the worst sin that could ever happen to speak to Nick Fuentes? Point number two I'm going to make here is the stunning hypocrisy again, okay, of him picking the topic of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to pretend that he's noble, to pretend like he has to say something even though he's lying in defense of what's happening to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s widow when it is just a fact that Ben Shapiro does a lot of things behind the scenes to stop the rise of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). ^t-00-15-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=960" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-16-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's a fact. Okay, here's another text message. I have literal hundreds of them pertaining to Ben sending his YAF boys, the YAF boys, National Review peeps that were coming after us, writing articles, the one that I showed in this little, our thumbnail here. We can show this conversation. Yeah, it was a headline. "Ben Shapiro's YAF launches smear campaign against Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Candace Owens (the host)." ^t-00-16-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=1005" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-16-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Hey, Charlie (Charlie Kirk), wherever you are, it's happening again. It's just like, just a smear campaign. I don't know why, but this is what Ben does. And it is also interesting that when I was telling you that Ben called Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and he was lamenting the fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I had this friendship and warning him that he shouldn't have me. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) felt like Ben was like throwing down like slave owner vibes, and he was just like he thinks I like own you or something. But I'm going to show you the text messages because otherwise you'll say it didn't happen. Here we go. This was again everything we Ben was going on people's shows and talking down about me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And he said, "You're bigger than Ben now." "I'm walking into the White House yesterday, I realized that." ^t-00-16-45

And he said, "We just have to treat him like noise. He wants you to punch down to him. His respect amongst movement fighters is quite low." I feel like that's relevant right now to what Ben's doing. He wants to egg on this fight because he's lost a certain bit of respect. And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) goes on, "You got in his head, which is terrific. The Ben thing involves me more than he wants to admit." And then we went on and this is the same conversation. He knows that Jon Snow—he's using a Game of Thrones reference—is stronger as the dragons fly higher. And he said it pisses him off. And he is sending his incestuous brother to go try and kill us. It's worse. He views you as my slave, 100%. "Control her" is what he really was saying to me when he called. ^t-00-17-30

And so you have to imagine being in my position when you see someone who did everything he could to kind of stop the rise of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), now trying to struggle session Megyn, who was actually a very good friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) deeply respected her. And towards the end, obviously, she took a very principled position on telling the truth about what he was going through. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) dies and suddenly he's like, I care about this evil that could be happening. Candace (Candace Owens, the host) is investigating who killed her friend and she shouldn't be doing that. I mean, there's no way to spin it. What is his suggestion here? That me asking questions about Turning Point USA somehow means that I'm blaming Erika who wasn't even working for Turning Point USA when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died because now she's the CEO? ^t-00-18-11

And it is just to me, it is truly so gross to do this to a person that you know you tried to block and you just now that he's dead, I guess you want to sort of rewrite history. That's what you're trying to rewrite history and pretend that you're his ardent defender. Now, another point that I'd like to make is the stunning hypocrisy again and again when you stop and you consider that he's pressing Megyn and referring to this as an evil, the thing that I never said or did. But this is the same Ben Shapiro that roots the destruction of Gaza on. ^t-00-18-49

But I guess Tucker (Tucker Carlson) speaking to Nick Fuentes is just so much worse than celebrating, and not just celebrating, interviewing a man who is committing an actual genocide, okay? That's not up for debate. That's what they're trying him for. Benjamin Netanyahu is committing a genocide, and Ben Shapiro sat down with him last month. And do you guys think he pressed Benjamin Netanyahu on the point of a genocide? I don't understand how you could just go out there with your hair on your chest and you're just like, yeah, how dare you? ^t-00-19-31

How dare you not make a comment? I care now about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) now that he's dead. I care about him and what's happening. Candace (Candace Owens, the host) trying to find out who killed him. That's evil. You're lying. You lie when you have nothing left. So the question becomes, what is Ben actually doing here? Because it's certainly not principled. I think we can put that to bed. It's actually also risky behavior when it comes to Ben Shapiro. Like he doesn't usually come out of the gate like that. And I think a couple of things are driving this unforced error. One, I do believe that he is actually scared of Nick Fuentes, okay? ^t-00-20-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=1255" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:20:55</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-20-55.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I think that fear comes from guilt. Nick's backstory—don't care what you think about him, you already know I don't like Nick Fuentes because of how he treated me. But the backstory is compelling. I learned the backstory listening to Jeremy Boreing, the former CEO of Daily Wire, sit down with Nick. So right after I've been fired, and I didn't know what Ben and Jeremy admitted that they did to him. And so I think if you artificially push somebody out of the market and Ben has never come out and denied anything that Nick Fuentes has said, also Jeremy Boreing denied in a conversation with him. So we have to assume the story is true. And given what I know about what happens now, I think, and what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was going through, I think we can all realize that Nick was an 18-year-old kid, like he told Tucker (Tucker Carlson), and now the whole world knows this story. ^t-00-20-55

And now when they did this because they wanted to rid themselves of Nick Fuentes, who then became angry about it and definitively has said very offensive things on the internet, but also he was 18, 19 years old. Now you see him on Tucker (Tucker Carlson). You don't like Tucker (Tucker Carlson). And I think... it makes him uncomfortable. I think we're in Harry Potter, right? And Lord Voldemort thought he killed the baby, and the baby may be lit. I don't even know who the Dark Lord is in this story, but I do know. ^t-00-21-35

Without advertisers, without sponsors, without connections, with the entire media writing things about him, being put on the ADL's list, he has proven to be quite resilient. And it is in large part due to how hard they fight him that people become curious. It's like we're watching kids be bombed. Like, how many people have lost their lives in Gaza? And you're telling me the greatest evil is Nick Fuentes? I'm sorry, I think I can survive Nick Fuentes insulting me. I don't feel the need to wheel and deal behind the scenes or, you know, tell Tucker (Tucker Carlson) not to host. ^t-00-22-18

It's just really not my business. I'm like, Megyn, I just don't care. Like, okay, if somebody wants to be a fan, they can be a fan of Nick Fuentes. And I sense an insecurity here in the fact that 10 years on from when Ben had this thing that happened to Nick Fuentes that he tells a story about, now Nick Fuentes is still here and Ben's influence is waning. It just factually is. Another thing that's happening here, and this is on the point of Megyn Kelly and going back to the making it sound like Ben's got a popular position about me. I sense that the pro-Israel lobby is on the brink of collapse. They are desperate for allies, right? And they're so desperate for allies that they're forcing them away. That's what they're doing to Megyn Kelly, right? ^t-00-23-01

Ben is lying right now to get what he wants. And for whatever reason, the pro-Israel lobby believes that this repeat failed strategy of lying and threatening people is going to work. Now, you might be asking, well, how is Megyn Kelly being threatened here? This is exactly what Ben just did on stage. That is exactly the moral blackmail that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was speaking about in the last days of his life, okay? Ben is morally blackmailing Megyn, right? He's sitting across from her. The threat is her reputation. He's standing there and he's saying, "Candace (Candace Owens, the host) is attacking a grieving widow and accusing her of murdering Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." Will you disavow this evil on the spot? And he's got these fake people going, "Woo, yeah." ^t-00-23-46

Like maybe that is evil. Like that's, does that happen? He doubles down; he's like, yes. She said, "Seth Dillon murdered Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." Will you disavow this evil on the spot? That is moral blackmail. Are you a better person than to accept Candace Owens (the host), who has attacked a grieving widow and is saying to that grieving widow that you murdered your own husband? That is moral blackmail. Now, speaking of on the spot, everything that you just saw happen here, and Megyn Kelly, I hope you see this. Truly, you guys, send this clip to her.

While I was heading to speak at this event, we learned because there was an intern at the Daily Wire who had a conscience and she felt very uncomfortable with the secret mission that she was put on. We learned that a covert mission was happening where they were sending an intern to ask me a question, okay, to get my answer on the question. And then what was going to happen next is they were going to pass around a clip, but they're going to make it look like she was just a random student. ^t-00-25-16

The Daily Wire has sent somebody secretly to record you, an intern, a PR intern, to secretly record you, to catch you in a bad moment, in a bad light." I think that intern's name—no, to be fair, it is never the fault of a person when their employer is sending them to do something that isn't good—but I would really love it if Ariana stood up.

He's like, call him out on stage and offer the debate and I will fly him out personally to come debate you on this. But this is how it works. Okay. They send people; they make it look like it's organic. They'll send people to your events and they will have people applaud. That was orchestrated by Alyssa Cordova. Now that she's not at the Daily Wire, I can say that who I was calling out yesterday, but it's so important for people to get this. What is happening at Megyn's events? I will guarantee you people coming and asking her questions and trying to get her to disavow Tucker (Tucker Carlson). That is not organic, okay? That is pro-Israel people that are paid to do it.

I will tell you how many people were sent there to go and rouse applause actually trying to intimidate you and to force you to take a position and to make you feel uncomfortable because it's a part of that moral blackmail pile-up. And so I'm actually genuinely not upset. I don't care. I believe in the free market. I genuinely will say again, I will always debate Ben Shapiro. If, you know, if Tucker (Tucker Carlson) left you on read and you want to come on this show and you want to debate Israel and you want to discuss Erika Kirk and the things I never said, if you want to discuss your relationship with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), anything that I have said that you would like to dispute, my platform is your platform. ^t-00-28-34

But we could also do yours. So hit me up. We'll be right back after a brief break. All right, you guys, I've been speaking a lot about Riverbend Ranch because you guys know I love their steaks, Black Angus beef that is famous for its great flavor. Riverbend Ranch has taken Black Angus beef to a whole new level because over the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite Black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. ^t-00-29-05

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1PS67aRmcA&t=1789" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:29:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-r1PS67aRmcA/t-00-29-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch to raise those calves without the use of growth hormones and without antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. So when you purchase from Riverbend Ranch, you're not only supporting the 64 cowboys and their families who work on that ranch, but you're also supporting over 260 other U.S. ranches and the hundreds of American families who work on those ranches as well. It's born in the USA, raised in the USA, processed right here in the USA. The meat is aged to perfection for 21 days and then it's shipped directly from their ranch to your home. This is not your average Black Angus beef. ^t-00-29-49

So visit riverbendranch.com and use promo code Candace at checkout. Also, I want to speak to you about Goldco because what are you doing today to protect your tomorrow? Because waiting until later is just a myth. We are already living in a later. You should consider adding gold into your financial strategy. And I'll tell you why. Because when economies wobble, currencies can lose their value and markets can get scared. Gold does not always follow suit, though. Having some gold means that you're not 100% dependent on one system. You have something solid. What you do now can set a tone for later. ^t-00-30-32

It's very unsettling for me to hear things like you saying, "Our government is occupied by Zionists, Trump (Donald Trump) is occupied by Zionists, we're an occupied nation." Because like, there's literally a term that's like an '80s, '90s term from white nationalism, ZOG, Zionist Occupied Government. It's their idea that Jews control the world.

Could it be that actually Zionism is what it actually represents? What does that mean? Zionism is a political philosophy. Zionist-occupied government. If you look into the history, yes, I believe we are a Zionist-occupied government and we're not the only one. Yes, and I take it to the bank. If you need to walk out of here and say Candace (Candace Owens, the host) is a white nationalist for you to be able to digest it, then that's fine. ^t-00-34-42

But what I will say is I stand by every statement that I made, and I want to double down on it. America is occupied by Zionists. I'd like to triple down on that if there's anybody going. I'd like to triple down on that. These tactics are super boring and tired. And this is why it hinges upon suppressing speech, right? Constantly having to refer to somebody as evil or white supremacist or anti-Semitic because you've lost the argument on the merits. Like there is no merit to your argument anymore. So it's all a constant struggle session of semantics. And then she moves on to "they." ^t-00-35-25

Nobody said, "What do you mean by that?" Several times, she just, "What do you mean by they?" As if she didn't understand how to construct a basic sentence and to refer back to the noun. She had no idea which plural noun I was referring to. Anyways, I was not really in the mood and here is our conversation about "they." "They" is a word, so I don't need to always say "they." It's just a weird—this is one of these psychology tactics where you're like, "Who is they? Who is they?" And it's like—That sounds like you're saying Jews. Does the word "they" mean Jews? ^t-00-36-09

If I want to say something about Jews, I'll say it. If I want to say something about Israel, I will say it. If I want to say something about Black people, I'll say it. When I was saying during BLM, "They want us to believe," nobody said, "Do you mean Jews?" And so again, it's one of these trash tactics to make people fearful to speak. If I want to say Jews, I will say Jews. I don't fear saying Jews. When I say Zionists run the media, I mean Zionists run the media.

He's taken over $230 million from pro-Israel groups. During the summer against Iran, even though he advised against it, Israel still attacked Iran and the U.S. still bombed on behalf of Israel. Your father's frustrations with Netanyahu have been made clear when he cursed on national TV over the situation. Israel has not been a great ally to the U.S. all the way since 1960 when they bombed the USS Liberty. Israel is a nation where Christians are constantly under attack in both Gaza and the West Bank.

After everything that we've been through over the past five years, the number of people that are getting that flu shot is at a record low. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective at best, and that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is, of course, a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company. If you wake up with a sore throat or runny nose, you can address those symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit containing ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, a generic Z-pack, and there's so much more as well. It's like having an urgent care center in your own home. ^t-00-44-36

I simply open the kit, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and get back to life. The kit is a lifesaver, a time saver. It's got thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So go to TWC.health/Candace today and use code CANDACE to save $48. Get it now before a cold and flu season kicks into high gear. Again, that's TWC.health/Candace, code CANDACE, for $48 off. Kits are only available to U.S. residents.

American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They are saving people just like you, an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in the low fives as a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. And if you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving.

I just, I don't understand it. I'm not offended by anybody sitting down with Nick Fuentes. And I think everybody should be in the free market. If Nick Fuentes loses in the free market, I want it to be because there was better competition, not because he's just been artificially pushed out. That's the only way that that works. Otherwise, it just, it's immature. It just is immature and it's whiny too. Katie Rabian writes, "Missing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) extra today. We all deserve the truth no matter how awful it is.

It's like, oh, if you investigate, then you're attacking Erika. It's a nonsense. It makes me think that there's something there, right? Like, what are they so afraid of? Why is the pro-Israel lobby in particular so afraid of any incursion into the absurd storyline that the feds are trying to sell us about Charlie (Charlie Kirk)?

Amber Lee Fraz writes, "Let's not forget that he would be the one to pick up his bloodstained microphone." That is right. Ben did say that right after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died. And even that, it was just for me knowing what was between them. It was just a lot for me to process. I was going through so many emotions that week. I was so angry.

OK, and he knew I didn't say it. There's not a chance that he thought that I said Seth Dillon murdered Charlie (Charlie Kirk) or Erika Kirk murdered Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So he's showing his fear. And also, like I said, I think he wanted to bully, effectively bully, Megyn Kelly into a position. And she's trying to come up for air. And she's like, wow, people are cheering this on.

Tom Simpson writes, "Are we sure Fuentes being pushed isn't as an op to smear the anti-Israel dissident right by association?

Look, when I invited him on my podcast, genuinely, I just wanted to have a conversation so I can tell you, because I'm not an op, but the sense that I got with how he reacted and lied about how we treated him is the first thing that made me think he was an op, because I was like, that's so weird. ^t-00-50-24

It's the behind-the-scenes actions that they take and how they treat people. And I mean, what a terrible guest for Megyn. ^t-00-53-14

You know you planned to press her and you know you probably planned to have people pass around that clip to try to embarrass her. That's not gonna bode well in the future if you're really looking forward to having her as an ally long-term. That's my advice, free to take it. Also free to come onto my platform. The number one podcast in the world right now, Benny. So what's up, you wanna come? You can come, we can have a conversation. I always believe in more conversation and genuinely I'm not angry, because how could I be angry? Success really is the best revenge. We'll see you guys on Monday. We'll see you guys on Monday. ^t-00-53-58
