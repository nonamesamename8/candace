Let's actually start today's episode with a game. I mean, the feds like to play games. Let's play a game. And this is one that everybody can join in on, okay? It doesn't matter how old or young you are. I want you to grab your cell phone, and I want you to go to your text messages. And search for certain terms that you just use when you speak to your friends—terms that were just casually tossed into a conversation, the alleged conversation held between the 22-year-old alleged killer<span id="event-event-2025-09-16-tucker-carlson-live-show-reveals-charlie-kirk-dono-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-16-tucker-carlson-live-show-reveals-charlie-kirk-dono.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-16-tyler-robinson-indictment-and-text-messages-releas-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-16-tyler-robinson-indictment-and-text-messages-releas.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-08-charlie-kirk-loses-2-million-donor-pledge-over-tuc-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-08-charlie-kirk-loses-2-million-donor-pledge-over-tuc.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-12-tyler-robinson-apartment-raided-overnight-by-fbi-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-12-tyler-robinson-apartment-raided-overnight-by-fbi.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-11-lance-twiggs-questioned-by-authorities-and-release-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-lance-twiggs-questioned-by-authorities-and-release.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>, and his 22-year-old boyfriend, <span id="ent-person-lance-twiggs-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-lance-twiggs.md">Lance Twiggs</a></span>. The first term I want you to search is "retrieve." Look it up. ^t-00-00-01

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-00-43.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:43</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=43" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** When was the last time that you used the word "retrieve" between you and a friend? Retrieve. I'm going to retrieve something. I played this game with my entire staff, and I was able to find, dating back for the last three years, two messages where someone used that term. The first person was somebody that was former military, and the second person was a cop. Makes sense. Okay, we're not done playing this game. Second term that I want you to look for in your phone is "vehicle." Vehicle. I mean, what pops up for you? Is that something that you say? I'm just gonna go outside to my vehicle. I left something in my vehicle. I'll be right back. I just parked my vehicle outside. I don't remember where I parked my vehicle. ^t-00-00-43

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-01-28.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:28</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=88" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** What's popping up for you? Probably literally nothing. Maybe something related to the DMV that came up for me—things about the DMV. I think for Skylar, something came up for his car wash: "your vehicle is ready." Sounds pretty professional. I don't know what to tell you guys, though, because what they're telling us is that that is just the way the 22-year-olds are speaking these days. Apparently they just shoot the breeze with one another and they say "vehicle" and "retrieve." And if you don't believe me, then good. You shouldn't believe that. You shouldn't believe me when I say that. So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-01-28"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. ^t-00-01-28

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-02-22.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:22</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=142" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I love vehicles. Love fast vehicles. I'm a big vehicle person, said nobody ever. <span id="claim-claim-1bf10fac5038-t-00-02-22">The text messages that were released yesterday in the indictment of <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-02-22"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> make perfect sense if you don't think about them at all<a href="/claims/claim-1bf10fac5038.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. Like, literally, if you suspend all reason, all rationality, then they can make perfect sense. That's the only way. You just have to stop thinking. You gotta get to that point where you're like, "Are we still talking about <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-02-22"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span>?" No. To be fair, now we are more broadly considering how stupid the feds believe that we are. And the frankly obnoxious messages that someone strung together must clearly be for either our own or their own entertainment. ^t-00-02-22

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-03-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=186" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So I want to hyper-focus on those. I want to actually hyper-focus on what exactly is wrong with these text messages between Lance and <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-03-06"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span>. Now, first and foremost, the obvious thing: there's no timestamps. Right away, major red flag. Very easy to say he sent the first message at this time as a part of your investigation, right? Everybody is on edge globally wanting to know what happened, and they just remove that. But don't worry, you guys, because like I told you, one of the things that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and I always believed in was that we could work harder. And I gotta tell you, these devils are working pretty hard, but we can work harder than them, okay? ^t-00-03-06

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-03-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=225" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And I decided to go back and, on the basis of what <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-03-45"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> allegedly writes to his lover, I decided I could work them into the timeline. I could work out an approximate timeline, at least for us to look at visually, for when they had to have been sent on the basis of what he's saying, right? Because he says certain things that were not revealed to the public at a certain time. So we're going to do that. I also want to point out the fact that the language—which many people said online, somebody actually left a very funny comment— it's like borderline poetic. He's got commas in there. It's like perfect English. And that's actually a striking contrast compared to what's inscribed ^t-00-03-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-04-27.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=267" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** on the casings, right? He goes through all of these memes that he's written, and I'm not hip to the lingo, okay? You gotta be real deep internet and hip. But for whatever reason, when he's writing these messages, he's very proper, extremely proper, right? Really wants to make sure he gets the punctuation correct. Anyways, let's just dive right back into the timeline. Let's dive right back into this conversation. And we're at first going to focus on the third message. And don't forget, just to lead up into this. They are telling us that at no time that we're allowed to know on <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-04-27"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>, after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-27"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was shot, ^t-00-04-27

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-05-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=306" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** the roommate—that's Lance—received a text message from <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-05-06"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a></span> which said, "Drop what you are doing. Look under my keyboard." And so Lance—I don't know what he does all day, but he can do that. He knows he's home. And Lance then runs. I'm saying he ran, prances—who knows—and looks, and he sees this note. And to be clear, we're never going to be able to see that note because the feds have since told us that the note was destroyed. But even though he destroyed the note, he took a picture of it. Yeah, that makes sense because if you're gonna destroy something, the best thing to do is to take a picture of it. And the feds saw the picture, but we're not gonna be able to see either. Anyways, don't think about it if you want it to make sense. ^t-00-05-06

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-05-48.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:48</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=348" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Then we find out that Lance, I guess, decided to take a picture and then text <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-05-48"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span> back. And here is where he asks him. Lance says, "<a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a>, what? You're joking, right?" Because the note said, "I had the opportunity to take out <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-48"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, and I'm going to take it." So Lance is like, "What? You're joking." And <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> says to him—<a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a> says—"I'm still okay, my love, but I am stuck in <span id="ent-gpe-orem-t-00-05-48"><a href="/entities/gpe-orem.md">Orem</a></span>, that's the town that <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-05-48"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> is at, for a little while longer yet." So poetic. "A little while longer yet." I'm going to look that up on my phone later. "It shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest, I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. ^t-00-05-48

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-06-32.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:32</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=392" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm sorry to involve you." Now, I wanna jump to this next message because it gives us a timeline. He says to him—I assume right away—Lance says, "You weren't the one who did it, right?" And <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-06-32"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a></span> says, "I am. I'm sorry." And the roommate says, "I thought they caught the person." OK, and <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> responds, "No, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing. I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down. It's quiet—almost enough to get out—but there's one vehicle lingering." Okay, so that lets us actually be able to drop that into the timeline pretty simply. ^t-00-06-32

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-07-18.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:18</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=438" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Why? Because we know—we can pull up this timeline—that they at first thought it was <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-07-18"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span>. So that's who he's referencing: some crazy old dude. <span id="claim-claim-9c39b18043fd-t-00-07-18">And on the timeline, Skylar, if you wanna pull that up so we can go through it—what time <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-18"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> gets shot<a href="/claims/claim-9c39b18043fd.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>? At 12:23 p.m.? Scroll down a bit. <a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a>. We learn about 30 minutes after that. <span id="claim-claim-9e7f1ffe8b77-t-00-07-18"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a>, the decoy boy—that's when it's announced that he's a suspect in custody by the <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-07-18"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span> police<a href="/claims/claim-9e7f1ffe8b77.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. But it's not until, by the way, 5:30 p.m.—because he mentioned that second suspect—<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-governor-cox-held-press-conference-at-53-t-00-07-18"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-governor-cox-held-press-conference-at-53.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> and he curiously says in that correspondence that he's wearing similar clothing, which I find to be strange. ^t-00-07-18

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-07-58.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:58</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=478" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="claim-claim-037b8b1683b2-t-00-07-58">We don't know what that second suspect is wearing until 5:30 p.m., when <span id="ent-person-governor-cox-t-00-07-58"><a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a></span>—12 minutes into a press conference; the press conference began at 5:30 p.m.—mentions that the second suspect, who is a person of interest, is wearing all dark clothing<a href="/claims/claim-037b8b1683b2.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. So the earliest that that message could have been sent out is after 5:30 p.m. I think it's unlikely because I think, again, this is all made up—these messages—because he says "wearing similar clothing." Okay, he tells us "dark clothing." What's similar about that? This guy allegedly, when he did this, was wearing black jeans and was wearing—pardon me—dark jeans and a black shirt. ^t-00-07-58

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-08-42.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:42</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=522" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So that's like everyone on campus. OK, nobody in the press conference says we picked him up because he was wearing something similar to the shooter. So that language right there is actually a mistake from the feds. But again, it allows us to be able to plot it into the timeline. So that's good. OK, timeline is back up here, and we then know. <span id="ent-person-kash-patel-t-00-08-42"><a href="/entities/person-kash-patel.md">Kash Patel</a></span> tweets that the subject in custody has been released. "Our investigation continues." That was a mistake. The guy in the darker clothing—we don't know who that is. And then it's after—again, like I said—that these correspondences then had to take place. So we're talking about late in the evening—six hours on. ^t-00-08-42

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-09-23.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:23</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=563" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I'm wondering what it is that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-09-23"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> is doing throughout this entire time. Skylar, you can keep this up because I wanna keep scrolling what he's doing throughout this entire time because that's a very long time for him to be just around campus. But then luckily he's gonna let us know what he's doing, right? He's gonna jump right in here, and he's telling us that he's close to the scene. We know in this conversation he then says to Lance that he's looking to get that rifle, right? He says, "I'm wishing I had circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle. I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring it back." Oh, I'm sorry. Let's actually go earlier. ^t-00-09-23

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-10-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=606" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He then tells us his alibi, which is amazing, right? He's saying, "I'm lingering around there. I'm trying to get the vehicle." And then, of course, as you always do when you're trying to clean up things, you then spell out your alibi, right? He asks him—Lance asks him—"Why did you do this?" And <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-10-06"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a></span> says, "I had enough of his hatred. Some hate cannot be negotiated out. If I am able to grab my rifle unseen—like I'm trying to clean up the scene, but also I'm telling you exactly what my motive is here—I will have left no evidence. I'm going to attempt to retrieve it again. Hopefully they have moved on. I haven't seen anything about them finding it." Okay, so we are now late in the evening. He's still hanging around. The roommate then comes and says, "How long have you been planning this?" He says, "A bit over a week, I believe. ^t-00-10-06

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-10-50.md" class="timestamp-link">00:10:50</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=650" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I can get close to it." Still trying to get close to that rifle. So I'm wondering if maybe the feds might drop us some footage, right? We should be able to see some footage. He's got to be idling in his car. You've been speaking about how he has this car. I'm assuming he's not just sitting in the woods or sitting on a sidewalk. Everybody's—this is a quote-unquote "manhunt." So where is he casually sitting, lingering, loitering? I don't know, but that would be some pretty good footage that they could release if they don't want us all to become conspiracy theorists, OK? He then says, "Yeah, I've been planning this for a bit over a week. I can get really close to it, but there's a squad car that's parked right by it." That's the drop-off spot. "I think they already swept the spot, but I don't want to chance it." ^t-00-10-50

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-11-34.md" class="timestamp-link">00:11:34</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=694" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And then he tells Lance that "I'm wishing I had circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle." Yeah, that's a vehicle. "I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring back grandpa's rifle." I went to exactly where I got this rifle from, okay? I don't know. I don't even know if that's—if it had a serial number. Weird, because he's been planning this for a week. He might have checked. Now all of a sudden he's getting in the details and is wondering if it had a serial number. That seems a little strange to me. But it wouldn't trace to me, of course, because you just told us in writing that it's your grandpa's. Definitely trying to cover your tracks. "I worry about prints. I had to leave it in a bush where I changed outfits." Okay, we're going to get to that. Focus on the changing outfits. That's a really important piece of this. ^t-00-11-34

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-12-17.md" class="timestamp-link">00:12:17</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=737" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And that is why I am now a confirmed conspiracy theorist on this. Okay. "I left it in the bush where I changed outfits," okay? "I didn't have the ability or the time to bring it with. I might have to abandon it and hope that they don't find prints. How the F will I explain losing it to my old man? Only thing I left was the rifle wrapped in a towel." That's the only thing. Otherwise, it was a perfect job. It was top of the line, professional job. The only thing I left behind was the weapon with my prints on it. Oh my gosh, right? Like that's kind of amazing. Okay. Then he, of course, explains: "Remember how I was engraving the bullets? ^t-00-12-17

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-13-01.md" class="timestamp-link">00:13:01</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=781" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** The effing messages are mostly a big meme. I know I speak proper here, but it's just a meme that I was writing. I wrote 'notice his bulge.'" On <span id="ent-org-fox-news-t-00-13-01"><a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a></span>, I might have a stroke if they say that, right? If I see "notice his bulge" on <a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a>, I might have a stroke. All right, I'm going to have to leave<span id="event-event-2025-09-11-new-york-post-publishes-exclusive-photo-of-gun-and-t-00-13-01"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-new-york-post-publishes-exclusive-photo-of-gun-and.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> it. Oh, that really sucks. It's almost perfect. OK, so he then ends this message. This is all from the day. This is all we have from <span id="ent-date-september-10th-t-00-13-01"><a href="/entities/date-september-10th.md">September 10th</a></span>. Okay. "Judging from today, I'd say grandpa's gone." I want to make it very clear. This is grandpa's gun. Okay. Nobody should question this narrative because he has put it all here. "I'd say grandpa's gun does just fine." I don't know.

Let's call it 7 p.m. earliest, as I say here—which I want to be clear. The campus is four hours—three to four hours—away from where Tyler and Lance live together. We have a map here to show you that. So he's just loitering. Loitering until—like I said—earliest. He's signifying around, like, 7 p.m.<span id="event-event-2025-09-16-tucker-carlson-live-show-reveals-charlie-kirk-dono-t-00-13-45"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-16-tucker-carlson-live-show-reveals-charlie-kirk-dono.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> that he's still very close to campus. That's a long day. That's a real long day just waiting to see when you can go in there. And there's a manhunt. And he's chill. He's chill because he's changed his outfit.

He drops the clothes—his shooting clothes—right there. He got changed. He didn't have time to take the rifle that he put in the towel, but he did have time to change. That totally makes sense. And then for whatever reason, he had to leave the rifle with the prints on it, okay? What's interesting about that though is, like, you know, we should recognize that—curiously—what they've removed from this indictment—again, relevant to the clothes—was the fact that—and the governor is going to say it—that we are told that he at first enters campus on this day at 8:07 a.m. ^t-00-14-28

Like for a long time, but whatever. Let's go with that. Then what we have after that 7 a.m. press conference is that exclusively our guys—our resident guys over at the <span id="ent-org-new-york-post-t-00-18-10"><a href="/entities/org-new-york-post.md">New York Post</a></span> (every exclusive ever: <span id="ent-person-jeffrey-epstein-t-00-18-10"><a href="/entities/person-jeffrey-epstein.md">Jeffrey Epstein</a></span>'s death pictures, <span id="ent-person-ghislaine-maxwell-t-00-18-10"><a href="/entities/person-ghislaine-maxwell.md">Ghislaine Maxwell</a></span> found at an In-N-Out)—it's always the <a href="/entities/org-new-york-post.md">New York Post</a>, okay? I view them as the feds. Like if I'm the feds and I'm trying to make this seem like this is organic, I wouldn't give it to the <a href="/entities/org-new-york-post.md">New York Post</a> because we're in <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-18-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>.

So I am very inclined to believe this source on a couple of other things. And when I speak also to Lance's family, they are confirming what the source is telling me. So we're going to go through this: 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.—all of the things that then took place. So they released the photo, and then we are told—as my source initially told me—that it was the mother who recognized Tyler, and she phones him up. Tyler says, "Mom, I'm sick." ^t-00-19-38

And at this point, we can jump back into day two of our messages because <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Robinson</a> says—he says to Lance—"Delete this exchange." Okay, so... Apparently, he did answer, according to the indictment. ^t-00-20-22

And he tells us that <a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a> was suicidal, and that is when they just told him, like, you know, "Calm down. Let's speak to you." They bring over their neighbor—share a friend—and they agree that he should go in. Now... If he was, in fact, suicidal, you don't get that vibe from these messages to his lover, right? There's nothing in here that he's like, "I can't believe what I've done." Now, he slept. We don't know where. He seems to be perhaps on very little sleep. I would imagine he was. He just murdered someone. And he's not indicating in these messages that he's going through any sort of suicidal feelings. ^t-00-20-56

There's something here for everyone if you want to take the low-hanging fruit and think of this as left versus right, right? So if you're, like, you know, on the right, you're like, "I need to blame the left." Then it's like, "Whoa, the trans thing is here." But if you're on the left that you need to blame the right— well, "Dad was a die-hard MAGA." It's like—it's so fed. You know, it's just so federally written. It's amazing. So <span id="ent-work-chaos-t-00-21-38"><a href="/entities/work-chaos.md">chaos</a></span> right here. Anyways, I guess maybe if you're suicidal, that's what you said: "Dad's been pretty die-hard MAGA." And then we don't know again when these messages took place, but it all had to happen in these seven or eight hours. ^t-00-21-38

Don't take any interviews or make any comments," because the feds want to let you know why it is that we're not talking to Lance. They gotta tell you because <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-22-18"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span> told him. Duh.

And if any police ask you questions, ask for a lawyer and stay silent." So that's how it happens. And I want to tell you that we can jump back into the timeline here. Our source informs us that it was around seven o'clock p.m. <span id="claim-claim-7ac830adda5e-t-00-22-59">when everybody locally began receiving the text messages that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-22-59"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> was in custody and that they were going to pick him up in Warner Valley<a href="/claims/claim-7ac830adda5e.md" class="claim-indicator" title="View claim details">📌</a></span>. Now, Warner Valley is right next to <span id="ent-gpe-st-george-t-00-22-59"><a href="/entities/gpe-st-george.md">St. George</a></span>, so he lives very close to his parents—is what I want you to recognize. ^t-00-22-59

You've got Warner Valley. So they said that's where they went to go pick him up. That could very much be his parents' place. But what's really interesting about that—okay, if you consider that they are telling us at 7 p.m.—this is when all the messages started circulating—then we don't know why the feds say that it was the 33rd hour after the shooting—like a total Freemason. 33rd hour after the shooting—33 hours—that would be inaccurate. 33 hours would be at 9:23 p.m. Our person is telling us—and I tend to believe them—that everyone knew at seven o'clock p.m. ^t-00-23-36

And this is what I confirmed with Lance's family because I said, "Wait a second. You owned the house. When did they pick up Lance? When did Lance go in? When did the home that you own get raided by the feds? Did the home that you own get raided by the feds?" And what that family is telling me and what my source is telling me—it's matching, okay? So I'm feeling good about this. We'll say allegedly, but I'm feeling good about this, okay? So Tyler is allegedly in custody, and they are told: "Don't say, don't speak, don't do anything. ^t-00-24-16

Because we're going to hear that from <span id="ent-person-governor-cox-t-00-24-54"><a href="/entities/person-governor-cox.md">Governor Cox</a></span> the following morning.

They would know nothing. According to Lance's family, this is when they seized his electronics. They say that he's deep on the internet web—that there's definitely gonna be something there. And yet they told us that—quite oddly—Lance gets released right back to his parents. Right—not right back. Lance just gets released to his parents while they're raiding his apartment. Why would they release Lance? Wouldn't you think that you would be detained like for at least 24 hours, right? ^t-00-25-39

Uh, for whatever reason, the FBI quickly releases Lance. Um, and I'm told that he is dropped off at his parents' home—allegedly, allegedly.

I'm getting tons of people that are messaging me telling me he's corrupt, that he forced himself onto the ballot, that he wasn't even supposed to be the governor. Allegedly, allegedly, allegedly. I just don't like him. Every time we find an inconsistency, I actually find him to be the mouthpiece of it, okay? So he is representing... and my source says falsely that they picked up <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-29-06"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>. And by the way, it makes perfect sense that my source is saying that that's not accurate— in the same outfit that we just showed you, okay, of the maroon thing that happened at eight o'clock.

Now remember, I told you that <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-29-45"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span>'s classmate reached out, and they insisted that this was an incredibly odd thing because he was very tidy. He was very clean. And they said, "That's the first thing that they went—that just sounds weird. He was a very tidy dude." Now I'm telling you that my source is saying he wasn't wearing that outfit when he got picked up. He wasn't wearing that outfit when he was brought to the office. If I have this wrong, this would be a very easy thing. Okay, surely they're going to have photos. They've got something for them to release. It's like, "Yeah, no, we totally got him."

This is what we should be hyper-focusing on. He kind of wraps it up and says he was wearing the same outfit, and that always sounded dumb to us. Why would you not take a shower in 33 hours, okay? It doesn't make any sense to anybody whatsoever. And people are saying that fact is untrue, okay? Now, if that is untrue, let's first show you how he wraps this up. We might show you a portion of what he said again because he wanted to compress his six-minute clip, but listen to how he wraps up this conference too because it's relevant.

He says "closure." "We got him." They already start in. He starts talking about the messages. He starts filling in the blanks. He said he had it. He put it in a towel. We have messages. It's all over. We found it on <span id="ent-org-discord-t-00-31-35"><a href="/entities/org-discord.md">Discord</a></span>. <a href="/entities/org-discord.md">Discord</a> is going to say that's not true. So who made up these messages? When were these messages made up? Is the question. If <a href="/entities/org-discord.md">Discord</a>'s saying they don't exist, this signals to me that these messages were just created, right? And I'm further feeling that way because there's no timestamps. Again, I want to be proven wrong, okay? But I don't like this at all.

How long does it take to raid a home? I don't know. Is it quick? Is it like a 10-minute thing? It feels like it'd be a long thing to grab the devices. If you knew that you had not even begun going through those devices, how would you say that we can close this chapter? Why would you say that we can close this chapter? I would have said, honestly— and he does not—"We raided his home, and we are looking for more information. We think that there's gonna be a lot more information, but we wanted to let you know that we at least have one person that we feel is definitely involved." That's not what he says. He says it's over.

And the person whose place we raided—who was the one that the family says is super internet—we just kind of released. We weren't interested in that. What are we to discern from all of this? I'll tell you. I'll tell you my take on this. I think the person in the maroon that's walking is different from the person that's walking up the stairs. It's a gut thing, okay? I don't know—no—but I know, okay? I don't know—no—but I know. It makes sense in the timeline of <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-33-03"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zinn</a></span>, the decoy boy, that we've got other people that are doing different things. And they do not want us to prod the narrative about the person in maroon. It doesn't make sense. They can't tell us. He said he planned this for weeks. ^t-00-33-03

He would have done that. He would have obviously been able to do that already because he's been planning this for a week. He knew where <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-33-47"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was speaking, right? Make it make sense. It's very easy to debunk me. Very easy. You should have footage of him in that Dodge Challenger just waiting and salivating. He kept checking. He said, "Oh, here I am right here." Just waiting to get that rifle back. I'm waiting to get that rifle back. Where's the footage? You were on a manhunt. Where is the footage? Surely during a manhunt, you use drones. ^t-00-33-47

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg/t-00-34-28.md" class="timestamp-link">00:34:28</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WEHTk0Xewg&t=2068" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I feel like we are capable enough that during a manhunt—after a murderer of a college student decides to take out <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-34-28"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, who has been a friend of the feds, right? I think probably not a good idea to be friends with these people, but whatever—he's been a friend of the feds. Surely this is a big issue. And to put to rest any conspiracies, you're gonna show us that drone footage, and we're gonna see the Dodge Challenger just sitting there for hours and hours and hours. And we're maybe even gonna be able to see—'cause I'm sure at that point, like, cops maybe set up some barricades or something—to see who was going in and out. And then he decided he's going to leave. Show us the footage. ^t-00-34-28

Show us him leaving campus before he returns back to campus around 11:30. Just show us the footage, okay? I'm demanding it. You know why? Because I need to be able to fit things into my timeline, if that's okay with you. So I would discern that we are looking—just by—again—two different people would be my thing. Two different people. One of those people—individuals—is definitely being protected. And separately, we can definitely make out that for whatever reason Lance is being protected. ^t-00-35-08

There's no way you release that guy immediately. There's no way that you intentionally purge him out of these messages, okay? The excuse "he's being cooperative" doesn't work. You can be cooperative while you're still being detained at least 24 hours before you would say, "I felt good to clear him as a suspect," especially when you haven't even raided his home yet. They released him instantly, and they said "job done." So I would like more information about <span id="ent-person-lance-twiggs-t-00-35-53"><a href="/entities/person-lance-twiggs.md">Lance Twiggs</a></span>. Okay, I already don't like that mom received a bachelor of science from <span id="ent-org-stanford-university-t-00-35-53"><a href="/entities/org-stanford-university.md">Stanford University</a></span> in psychology.

And I'm not the only one. His family feels that way, okay? His family thinks it's odd. Like I said yesterday—I spoke to them; today I spoke to them yesterday. They think it's odd that the feds moved on from him so quickly and that the feds were being dishonest—and they felt—about everything when they first came out with information. So why are we all feeling that way? We absolutely need to get to the bottom of it. Let's take a quick break. I'm going to show you some stuff.

That's why they donate 10% of every sale to support pregnancy care centers across all 50 states—providing life-saving ultrasounds, resources for moms in need, and real hope for families. And it all started with one simple idea: using your morning coffee to stand for life. 7 Weeks Coffee is more than a great-tasting coffee.

I really am grateful for your shining a light on this federal corruption.

So don't plead to his pastor. Don't plead to people that work at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-01-07-30"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span>—any of them who have been coming forward and saying something weird is going on. And I'm trying to figure out how to present that to the public. If you want to make a plea, those are the only people that I will answer to. And I've got a feeling that, you know, <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a> has been—you could see the energy. She's gonna fight. She's gonna fight, and she is going to fight on the good side because every woman would know what her husband's going through. ^t-01-07-30

It's just—it's too much. It's too much. So we are going to stay on it, and I'm grateful to you guys for being along this journey. The stuff that we have even been able to put together is in large part thanks to you guys that are reaching out. We will stay on it, and we'll see you tomorrow. ^t-01-08-11
