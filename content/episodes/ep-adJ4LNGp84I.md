I'm telling you that you can begin your timers because it is not going to be long until the media tries to convince you that Megyn Kelly—yes, that Megyn Kelly—is Adolf Hitler. I'm not kidding. It's definitely coming. There is going to be some headline in the near future that reads, "Megyn Kelly is flirting with anti-Semitism." You can book it. Why? Because out of nowhere and for absolutely no apparent reason at all, the agents—like I think of them as like Mr. Smith in The Matrix—have ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=36" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-00-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I guess they're surrounding Megyn Kelly and demanding that she make a statement against me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson), of course, Candace (Candace Owens) and Tucker (Tucker Carlson). It is so bonkers. I got to show you what they are saying to her. Before we get into that, some incredible breaking news. We have now confirmed that there was indeed a woman who was with the shooter in the footage that was captured by the houses nearby the area. And for whatever reason, the FBI has not yet released or even acknowledged that that footage exists. This is absolutely huge, actually. I think this is the biggest thing that we have uncovered since the beginning of this investigation. So let's jump right back into this. Welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-36

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=90" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:30</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-01-30.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, so a couple of things that I want to clarify right at the top here, because sometimes we get a ton of emails about one subject that we've already researched, and that is the case regarding, first and foremost, you're seeing a lot of this chatter going around about the renting of the State Farm Stadium for Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s memorial service. I think there were 90,000 people that attended and then spilled over. And many people online have speculated—accurately, by the way, some credit to you guys—that in order to book a venue of that size, you would have had to have done so in advance, right? Venue contracts do not just materialize out of nowhere for a space that holds that many people plus spillover. ^t-00-01-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=130" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-02-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, given my many sources at Turning Point USA, I was able to quickly get an answer on that one for the public. The venue was indeed secured in quick order, but that was because they had help from the White House, and Turning Point did not book that venue back in May, so we can formally debunk that. I was told that the White House stepped in and put in a personal phone call to the event coordinator. And they actually did already have an event that was scheduled. And the White House simply asked those people if they would be willing to move or reschedule their event. It was apparently supposed to be an RV show, actually. And obviously, given the nature of the tragedy, it was globally traumatizing to everybody. ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=174" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:54</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-02-54.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I think everybody was moved by Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. The people that held that space were willing to oblige it. So that tracks with me. That seems accurate. I just wanted to help you guys with that information. Also, another thing that I came across, and this is regarding Phil Lyman's campaign website. You guys were asking me if we came across that. Yes, I did come across that, and I actually in the short run didn't think much of it because I thought, okay, well, he was running a campaign and he has a website and maybe people were writing in reviews and saying he was a great person. But yes, we were aware that George Zin is one of just 20 people that is a featured endorsement. He endorses Phil Lyman's character. ^t-00-02-54

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=217" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-03-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** You can see that here. George Zin writes, "Rare to find a more caring man with uncompromising goals to make Utah great for generations than Phil Lyman, not a politician who can be pampered. Phil has a knowledge of urban and rural Utah from every corner and community. Utah is in desperate need of true leadership and representation and Phil has the passion and the values to be a great governor. He needs our support." Now, I'm not sure what to make of that. I did want to use Wayback Machine to see whether or not that was a new entry. Maybe somebody is trolling there. And no, they are not. That entry has been there at least since—and I'm gonna show you this on Wayback—at least since June 6th, 2024. ^t-00-03-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=262" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-04-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So I don't know what to make of that. Now, I will say other locals told us that George Zin, for whatever reason, is very involved in Republican politics. Take from that what you will, meaning that he shows up to a lot of events. But of course, Phil Lyman's people would have been controlling that website, certainly should have been aware of his erratic character, and maybe wouldn't want to have featured him on that website. I don't know. It's definitely something to consider. Some other things that are of interest, okay? Yesterday, we mentioned that apparently it was kind of everybody's first day on the job, right? ^t-00-04-22

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=301" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:01</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-05-01.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** 9/10 was everybody's first day on the job, meaning that there were a lot of these recent and brand new hires in Utah that would all kind of come across and have to deal with this case. Kash Patel, I told you, cleaned house at the State Bureau. He then installs a person that has a long tenure in DC, Robert Bowles. His first case is Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Why would he wanna uproot and move his family to Utah after having roots in Virginia for so long? I don't know, but that's the circumstance. ^t-00-05-01

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=334" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-05-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Also, I told you there was a new CEO and therefore a new lead surgeon, Andrew Zenger, over at the hospital, the regional hospital that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was taken to, although that was not the nearest hospital from the university, and it also ranked extremely low in terms of the best-equipped hospital, if you will, to deal with the sort of trauma that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was suffering from, a neck wound, obviously. So it's very strange. I think it would be interesting to learn whether or not that new CEO and surgeon worked on Charlie (Charlie Kirk). That's something that I would like to find out. If you know that information, please send it to us at tips@candaceowens.com. Okay. ^t-00-05-34

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=378" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-06-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** That's not it, though. There were also some other new people, and I forgot to mention the judge that is in the case that is overseeing the case against Tyler Robinson is Judge Tony F. Graf Jr. He was recently appointed to the 4th District Court in May of 2025 by Governor Spencer Cox. I was also informed that the coroner in this case was also brand spanking new. That name has not yet been released. I am told that person is new. Okay. And I have also learned, I've been told that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did indeed have an autopsy. ^t-00-06-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=419" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-06-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** I wanted to let you guys know that because I saw a lot of rumors that were circulating that he did not have an autopsy. That has been confirmed. An autopsy did take place. By the way, you should know that in the state of Utah, in case you, like me, are maybe holding your breath that we're going to see that report, those reports are actually kept private. So there isn't going to be some big release outside of what maybe the immediate family members wishing for that and saying, "I feel like something's wrong and I would now like to release the autopsy report." That's the only way that we are going to be able to see it. That's at least what I've learned. Now let's jump back into what actually took place on that day, because I'm starting to get a bit of a stronger hunch about things. ^t-00-06-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=462" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-07-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** We'll jump back in here regarding Skyler Broderick, who is, according to Phil Lyman, a cousin, who he refers to Phil as his uncle across interviews. Doesn't matter. They're family members, is the main point, and they know each other. And Skyler Broderick has, of course, mysteriously deleted all of his socials, except for Instagram, but he's wiped his Instagram, okay? Just deleted his Facebook and just outright deleted his LinkedIn page because I asked him a question before we even went live. That was his response, okay? Now, he did this not before I grabbed everything that I needed from his pages. I just had a suspicion ^t-00-07-42

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=504" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-08-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** that he might not be willing to participate. And I was operating under the assumption that he might just privatize his socials. So I instructed my team to grab everything before I even made contact. Now, what I did not anticipate was that he would delete the content. Why would he delete the content? That part never was tracking for me. It didn't make sense to me. Now, it sort of maybe does make a lot of sense to me. So you will recall that we had received a lead live on the show. Someone paid money to inform us that there was footage that the FBI was hiding, right? She wrote in, said, "I have been trying to reach out to you everywhere. The FBI is hiding footage. ^t-00-08-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=548" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:08</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-09-08.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** The doorbell cam footage had more." This is what the person told us. She said, the shooter is then seen changing his clothes, and he is with a woman, she told me. Then she gives me a name, and that name was another Lyman family member, and that's when my spidey senses started tingling. I'm like, okay, this is a lot of Lymans now. I want to be very clear and fair to Phil Lyman. He has been forthcoming about the fact that his family owned that property. Like, they own everything there. That is not mysterious. He's not hiding that fact. UVU in many ways purchased the university from his family, right? The acreage from his family for that university. ^t-00-09-08

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=589" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:49</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-09-49.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** But I did feel that if that is the case, obviously, then Phil Lyman would in theory be able to access that footage, right? Be able to speak to his family members. And yeah, I didn't want to come out and say that it was a fact that the woman, that there was a woman with the shooter without any proof. We had no proof outside of this person, and what she was saying felt real to me, definitively, but I needed something more solid. Well, we came across something more solid. We reviewed the footage that Skyler brought. Of course, we downloaded everything but hadn't actually reviewed it; had wiped from the internet. ^t-00-09-49

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=633" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:33</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-10-33.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And yeah, the proof is in the pudding, and I'm going to let you hear it. Now, to set this up, you will recall that Skyler and his close friends that nobody knows, apparently, they were retracing the footsteps of the killer. They were at his grandma's house, he said, and he's speaking on camera with his aunt. To set this footage up for you, and sure enough, you're gonna hear right in the beginning, his aunt is going to mention that there was a woman who was helping the shooter, and she's not sure whether or not that person was an accomplice. I would say if you're helping, you're helping the shooter. ^t-00-10-33

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=670" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:10</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-11-10.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** You were an accomplice, but somehow we all missed this in this actual clip that Skyler had posted and has since been wiped from the internet. ^t-00-11-10

(Following clip is from Skyler Broderick’s aunt.) SPEAKER_2: If you can't time how long it took him to get from that little part over here was way longer than it should have been. SPEAKER_2: So I wondered if the girl had given him stuff, like if there is an accomplice. ^t-00-11-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=702" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:42</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-11-42.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So you see, she's talking about the shooter. And she says, I was wondering if the girl had given him stuff. And then somebody off camera says, you know you're filming. And she says, I'm sorry that you're filming. But it's very clear. There's no question at all. In fact, leading into that, which we should have maybe cut that a little bit earlier, they're speaking about how she thought the FBI had it wrong. The timing didn't make sense to her. And that's what she started with. The timing doesn't make sense to me because I thought that it took a little longer for him to walk. Let's play that again, Skyler, just so they can hear it again. She says that there's a girl. Take a listen. ^t-00-11-42

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=735" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:15</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-12-15.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** SPEAKER_2: If you can't time how long it took him to get from that little part over here was way longer than it should have been.

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=755" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:35</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-12-35.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** So just to be clear, those subtitles are wrong. That's AI. She's saying, I wondered if there is an accomplice. I wondered if there is an accomplice, which we should edit that, Chris, when we re-release that. And then somebody says something, something, and she's like, sorry, I didn't realize you were filming. Okay. So we have the woman who was my source who said that the FBI cut the footage, and she was certain of it. And now we have actually the woman who handed over her footage to the FBI saying, I wondered if that woman was an accomplice. Ladies and gentlemen, what the heck is going on? Who was the woman that was with the alleged shooter? ^t-00-12-35

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=799" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-13-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Why wouldn't the FBI immediately release that? Now, again, you should recall that the very next morning on September the 11th, TMZ already had the doorbell cam footage, okay? So that means that the FBI already had the footage, right? They would have seen that there was a woman with the shooter, and yet they chose during this manhunt, during this 33-hour manhunt, not to inform the public that they were also looking for a woman who this lady believes, she wondered whether or not she would have been an accomplice, if that was his accomplice. What happened to this lady? ^t-00-13-19

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=843" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-14-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Who is the girl, the woman, that was in this footage, guys? I don't know, what are your ideas here? Why would the FBI not tell us something so evidently crucial to this story, that we have a woman that's involved? What's she look like? How old is she? I obviously did the sensible thing, right? I reached out to Phil Lyman because it's his family. And I asked him whether or not he would be willing to track down this footage for me. And he's not happy with me. He's angry. I mean, he said really not nice things to me. He started asking me if I had something to do with the shooting. Okay. ^t-00-14-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=886" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-14-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** And I basically just stayed focused and said, Phil, okay, we showed your footage. He's very upset about cousin versus nephew thing. It's all irrelevant. If you're saying you actually want to help us catch the killer, right? If that's really where your heart was, if that's really why you injected yourself so much into this story, why wouldn't you, knowing how deeply I care about this, walk over while you're in the neighborhood popping by, walk over to your aunt, grandma, cousins, I don't care whose house, and say, hey, you said there was an accomplice, that there was a woman, okay, that might've been an accomplice. Do you mind letting me see the raw footage so that I can hand it over to Candace (Candace Owens)? ^t-00-14-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=929" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:29</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-15-29.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** In fact, how about just giving me any of the footage that your family rushed to give to TMZ? Why did they rush to give it to TMZ? By the way, you definitely said you were at your cousin's house and that you hadn't seen the footage. You were watching it live with Kayleigh McEnany on Fox News. That's what you said during that segment, right? This is the first time I'm seeing this footage. So apparently, your cousin, close enough to go to their house, but your cousin decides to give the footage to TMZ before you can even see it. Okay, maybe the feds gave it. That's another assumption. That's the only two options. Either your cousin gave it to TMZ, or the feds gave a portion of it to TMZ, which begs the question, why were we not told about the woman? Who was the woman? ^t-00-15-29

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=974" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:14</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-16-14.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** We should now all be putting a lot of pressure on the FBI to make a statement about why the woman who handed over her footage, I've now twice confirmed in her own mouth and from a source that there was a lady in that footage with the shooter. So why are they worried about that being caught on camera? Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you were filming. What's that about? It's like everybody knows something that I don't know. And I wanna be in the know on what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on 9/10. So if you have any tips pertaining to who the woman was that was caught, please let me know. I am going to try again to reach out to this family since I don't think that Phil Lyman wants to assist me. He doesn't like me. That's fine. I wonder if he likes truth. ^t-00-16-14

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=1018" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:58</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-16-58.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** If he likes trying to solve this thing, that would be great as well. If he doesn't want to talk to me, I'm happy to put him in touch with another journalist. But if you know something more and you'd like to reach out to us, please do. You can reach out to us on social media. And I please ask again that you guys reserve not sending us videos and TikToks and links, but rather, if you have information, please use tips@candaceowens.com. I love you all. And I love that the whole world wants to know what happened. And I'm grateful for that. But there is just so much data that an inbox can take. And we might have to just make a second line, is what I think we should do. Skylar, we should talk about that. Okay, now we turn our attention back to the mysterious individual that is next to Skyler, right? ^t-00-16-58

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=1060" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-17-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** We discover that one person was from Austria, and then we're going, who's this goth kid that Phil has been clear he does not know him? Phil Lyman does not know this individual. He could not help identify him. I told you it was unusual that our inbox wasn't instantly flooded with people telling us exactly who it was. Well, then we did get another hit on him, and a handful of you similarly found the same person that we did, a person going by the name Robbie Hilde, who was allegedly from Washington. Now, let me tell you why I don't think this is his true identity, okay? ^t-00-17-40

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=1099" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:19</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-18-19.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** Because if this was just some kid who grew up in Washington and went to school in Utah, my inbox would be flooded with that name, and it's not. It's simply not. Oddly, no one has come forward to claim that they know Robbie Hilde. They're all just saying, I got a hit. I got a hit. This might be him. No one is saying they went to school with him. This is a young college student. He's allegedly, like I said, from Washington State. And no one personally can say, I know this person. How could that be? How could that be? I'm going to tell you something because I'm starting to get a hunch about things, and we're going to go more deeply into this tomorrow. ^t-00-18-19

There seems to be some organized movement, people that are being given new identities. Actually, one person wrote to us and told us that UVU, in and of itself, as a campus, has an unbelievable amount of dedication. I mean, even the president, I'm blanking on her name, majored in Soviet studies. They have a direct pipeline from Russia to America. It's very interesting. ^t-00-18-55

His Uncle Mikey, who is working with the Ukrainian Azov Battalion. He's a military man. And that gets really interesting when I start to combine all of the aspects of this case, and again, we are still in theory territory, but I feel like we are in strong, I'm starting to get a stronger than a theory and more of a hunch that this was a military operation and people that executed this are actually from overseas. ^t-00-19-30

When you look at UVU campus and their strong ties to the CIA, things start to get really interesting, right? And I think this is a path that needs to be pursued, that these people have different identities and that they are perhaps all from overseas. And it turns out that there have been... The New York Times has reported on Russian-Ukrainian spies that are building new lives for themselves with new IDs in America, in Brazil. Essentially, what we're talking about are terrorist cells. I believe that. I believe that with the Ukrainian war, okay? ^t-00-20-14

Oh, we need to have open borders. It allows them to get in people that are perhaps completely insane and deranged. And they are in fact raising little militants and they're executing these programs.

Spiritually, that feels right to me. I've been pleading with you guys to get your kids out of these schools.

Her parent was posting Polish underground symbols, and I realized something was wrong. Something was off. I'm showing you this; this is like one headline, and this is translated from Russian, by the way.

And my suspicion is that this is happening right here in America. It would make sense that there is global communication if they want to take somebody out. And it is also a fact, by the way, that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was on a hit list. I also was on the hit list. Tucker (Tucker Carlson) was on the hit list, and actually, I forgot the name of the individual that worked for Alex Jones who got killed, but he was similarly on a Ukrainian hit list. ^t-00-22-22

SPEAKER_4: Evangelicals, from all my research, evangelicals are the reason that Israel has been supported in the public sphere outside of just Jews.

Okay, all of the acting. We don't want China. We don't want China to own TikTok. And I'm worried about your data. No, you wanted to hand it over to your Zionist friends. It was all a mirage.

And then, like, all of the agents, like Dave Rubin, all of them are like, don't you see what you did? And they make you think you're going crazy, but they kind of pretend to be your friend, and you're like, what did I do wrong? Like, I just said genocide is always wrong. I just retweeted Max Blumenthal, something he said that was sensible. And they come in and they're like, I understand what you're doing. I'm your friend, but I worry that other people are gonna see what you're doing and not understand. And it just, you know, I want you to be okay, because we're just wondering, like, we all agree that that's bad, right? So why don't you just say what I'm telling you to say, Meg, or you're gonna get it. We're gonna ruin your effing life. That's the subtext, Meg. That is the subtext, Megyn. ^t-00-37-04

I lived it. I lived it. There's no halfway with these people. I'm telling you, there's no halfway. She didn't do anything. She shared her episode and said, if you want to hear Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in his own words, here it is. That is literally what they are responding to. And now they're going to pretend to be her friends. So she responds to him and she says, the more one insists that I say what one demands me to, the more committed I get in my refusal. This was Charlie (Charlie Kirk). This was Charlie. He was like, I'm done. I'm just done. I'm digging my heels in, because they know what this is. Okay, Megyn is an adult. She's also quite brilliant. She's not going to fall for this, should I call it babble, right? Konstantin Kisin, and you're sitting here trying to, oh, just, I love you so much, I could try and manipulate a toddler. She's not stupid. And he says, I demand nothing of you and am coming from a position of great respect. ^t-00-37-49

And she said, your response proves the opposite of what it purports to. She sees right through him. Of course she does, because she's not a child, okay? This is how the agents work. They pretend to be your friend, and I'm telling you, if she doesn't buck, because that's what they want, they will, there, we will whip you and you will buck. And you will buck by making a strong statement against Candace (Candace Owens), Tucker (Tucker Carlson), when we demand it. Then they will send the next layer, which is a full-blown press attack, the press that they do not control, by the way. They do not control the press. That's anti-Semitic. I want to be very clear. They don't control it, but they will control it when they come after her. ^t-00-38-34

Watch that space. Okay, I want to make sure that I get to some of your comments because a lot of you guys have been writing in. I first want to throw it to PureTalk because our society works because of the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment.

We love the crisp air, we love the changes, the leaves, but the season of transition can also be tough on your skin. The end of summer sun, the new autumn wind, it can leave your skin looking tired, dry, and dull. So if you're looking in the mirror and you're feeling like your skin has lost its radiance with the season, I need to tell you again about my absolute go-to, which is Neeme skincare. Neeme is the reason ^t-00-40-00

Their three-step anti-aging routine is the perfect defense for this seasonal shift. It's packed with powerful, clinically-backed ingredients that work to restore your skin's barrier, which is exactly what you need to fight off that dry autumn air. It boosts collagen production to help with those fine lines. It locks in deep moisture, and it brightens your complexion, bringing back that healthy glow that you had in the summer. And here's what I love most. Neeme is proudly American-made. In a world of skincare dominated by foreign brands, Neeme formulates and produces everything right here in the USA. They deliver world-class quality while staying true to the values that we hold dear, which is faith, family, and freedom. You should not have to compromise your values to get incredible skincare, and with Neeme, you don't have to. ^t-00-40-44

Oh, I wanted to read this email that came in because Turning Point had the USU event last night. They went back to Utah and returned, made a big splash about that. And this person attended and wrote this to me. It reads, dear Candace (Candace Owens), tonight, which is September 30th, 2025, several friends and myself attended the TPUSA event at Utah State University. ^t-00-41-25

The event was scripted. The allowance of open dialogue was absent, and the entire presentation lacked authenticity. I'm happy to answer any questions about specifics, but if this is how TPUSA is going to proceed, then it will not be successful. I fully agree with you that if this is the vibe, the vibe that we're getting and catching right now, they're not gonna be successful, okay? You're never smarter than your audience. I say it over and over again. Everyone perceives that something is not right and we are not getting the truth, and they are too mum. And I definitely know, I received other emails of people saying that they felt that it was very much controlled. ^t-00-42-10

Okay. And there's a lot of fakeness and gayness that's happening right now. And yesterday it's why I just went ahead and took a shot at the beast. I will not allow them to turn Turning Point USA into a company that is shilling for Israel. I have people that are telling me that they're handing out TPUSA Faith packets and, like, Israel is mentioned eight times. Someone submitted it to me. I read it. It's ridiculous. And I know who's behind that. I do. And so I don't know where they're going. If they're trying to sink Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) company. It works; Turning Point works because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was authentic. Okay. ^t-00-42-50

We went to Israel together. You know, he authentically believed and loved Israel. And then he authentically was seeing what their tactics were, how they were trying to control speech, and he perceived them to be problematic, and it was their behavior that turned him against them. And the fact that they are just continuing that behavior now and just trying to pretend that the last part didn't happen, it sickens me. It won't survive unless there is more truth, and we should absolutely demand it. ^t-00-43-30

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=2646" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:44:06</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-44-06.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> Candace Owens:** There is a note here for my producer from Erica Mendel, who is an American-Israeli Jewish former IDF soldier currently serving as the—oh, that's her name, right? Erica Mendel. She is the public policy manager of hate speech. And she's been at TikTok since July of this year, and she's like, yeah, whatever, I'm an IDF soldier and it's now war, and we own this space. So of course the deal is going to go through if they're already putting IDF soldiers in control of monitoring our speech, which means we only have to get louder, and maybe we'll just choose a different platform in general if this is the direction that they want to go in. Basil Parhas writes, hey Candace (Candace Owens), would you want to debate the more prominent commentators like Ben Shapiro, Brandon Tatum, and PBD ^t-00-44-06

They all have hinted and danced around calling you anti-Jewish, genetically speaking, and excessive in their videos. I would debate PBD. I would debate Ben Shapiro. I wouldn't debate Brandon Tatum because I love Brandon Tatum like a brother, and nobody wins in that scenario. I've just known him, like, I know Brandon. I came up with him and Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I just know him as, like, a human being. And there are some things that to me are just, like, are bigger than politics. And so any conversation or debate that I'm going to have with Brandon will be treated in the same way like the debates that I would have had with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You know, Charlie and I never threw each other under any buses publicly. And when we did disagree, we had those disagreements privately. And so I would say the same about Brandon Tatum. ^t-00-44-47

He has been there for me, he's been there for my family. He's just, I see him as a human and not a political opponent. So that's my honest truth there. Rachel Day says, is it me or is it strange that not a single security guard pulled a gun once shots rang out? I am praying for you, Candace (Candace Owens), and I'm grateful for this reporting. We cannot claim ignorance here. Virtual hug from a homeschool mom. Just started the homeschooling thing this week. They are adorable. Yes, I think it is strange, actually. I thought about that after the fact, and they seemed to know that not more was coming. ^t-00-45-31

Yeah, you're kind of not the person that's allowed to freak out in those situations, and a lot of mistakes were made and a lot of things have not been explained.

How do you feel about Tyler's legal team? I've not explored that. I have been so hyper-focused. I know you guys have been like, have you seen this? Have you seen that? I want to solve who did this, right? And I want to do it in a way that makes sense to me. I'm a timeline person. I'm very good at gathering data and intel, vetting that information that I'm getting, and sharing it with the public in a way that they can digest. There's a lot of different rabbit holes that should be chased. That's definitely one of them. But my main focus right now is trying to figure out who else was involved on that day. Who is the lady that was in that photo? ^t-00-46-47

They share a building—just, FBI and ADL share a building. They're one and the same. I hope you guys know that. They share a building, I think, in Connecticut. Also, Israel is taking over ExpressVPN and other VPN websites. I always had a conspiracy about that. I used to read ads for them, ExpressVPN, when I was working for Daily Wire. And in back of my mind, I was like, it would make sense that they would train us to actually filter. There's so much data. So they're like, actually, why don't you pretend that this VPN hides things and so that we know exactly where to look? And once I found that it was started by an Israeli billionaire, I was like, yeah, no, that's gonna be a spying thing. That's how I felt, at least. ^t-00-47-25

So you're basically taking on the process of filtering for them. That's my conspiracy theory. One of many that I have, as you guys know, because you listen to the show. Lily writes, first they made a false statement about Candace (Candace Owens) not being friends with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). They pushed through their minions in the media. Now they planted a fake letter in the same New York Post and their minions. Candace (Candace Owens) must be up to something. Yeah, I know who had access to Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) laptop. And I have questions about that, but I'm going to wait for the financial report to come out, which I'm not handling. And I got question marks about a couple of people over at Turning Point USA. And yeah, I think we should definitely be speaking about these shady pastors. I hope this is the year of the shady pastor. ^t-00-48-10

There's nothing that's spoken about what Christians are going through. And they flood money into that and they get you to say that it's like a fellowship program. But then they have you, like, gathering pastors and paying off people. I mean, it's an ugly business. And I think it's about to all get exposed. I think it was a bad idea to kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk). That's what I think. I think the devil overplayed his hand because that's what the devil does. The devil is arrogant. The devil has no friends. ^t-00-48-55

And what I mean by that is if you pledge allegiance to the devil, just so you know, he will turn on you too, okay? You're only as useful to him as you are an idiot to him. If you're willing to do his bidding, he will play ball. And as soon as you are not, he does not care about you. You mean nothing to him. You are dealing with a true psychopathic individual who cares about nothing more than their own selfish goals. That's what I believe. Anyways, I want to again remind you guys that we have new merch. Finally, after so many messages, we made it happen. We should have done it sooner, obviously. We don't know, no, but we know. ^t-00-49-39

We will know now. I'm a Charlie (Charlie Kirk) story. You can head to CandaceOwens.com. If you'd like to buy merch, that's how you can support the show. We actually are not funded by any outside groups. We are taking influence from nobody other than the people that write to our tips box. We are being heavily influenced by them. I will say that. And I remind you, please, please, we love you all, but only if you have a tip that can help us crack this mystery. I do think that we're gonna get into a Russian and Ukrainian angle here for some reason, some way, somehow. We'll see. See you guys tomorrow. ^t-00-50-23
