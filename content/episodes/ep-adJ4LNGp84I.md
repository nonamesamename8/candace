I'm telling you that you can begin your timers because it is not going to be long until the media tries to convince you that <span id="ent-person-megyn-kelly-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a></span>—yes, that <a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a>—is <span id="ent-person-adolf-hitler-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-adolf-hitler.md">Adolf Hitler</a></span>. I'm not kidding. It's definitely coming. There is going to be some headline in the near future that reads, "<a href="/entities/person-megyn-kelly.md">Megyn Kelly</a> is flirting with anti-Semitism." You can book it. Why? Because out of nowhere and for absolutely no apparent reason at all, the agents—like I think of them as like Mr. Smith in <span id="ent-work-the-matrix-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/work-the-matrix.md">The Matrix</a></span>—have ^t-00-00-00

It is so bonkers. I got to show you what they are saying to her. Before we get into that, some incredible breaking news. We have now confirmed that there was indeed a woman who was with the shooter in the footage that was captured by the houses nearby the area. And for whatever reason, the FBI has not yet released or even acknowledged that that footage exists. This is absolutely huge, actually. I think this is the biggest thing that we have uncovered since the beginning of this investigation. So let's jump right back into this. Welcome back to <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>. ^t-00-00-36

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-01-30.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:30</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=90" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, so a couple of things that I want to clarify right at the top here, because sometimes we get a ton of emails about one subject that we've already researched, and that is the case regarding, first and foremost, you're seeing a lot of this chatter going around about the renting of the State Farm Stadium<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve-t-00-01-30"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-11-tmz-publishes-doorbell-cam-footage-of-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-30"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-tmz-publishes-doorbell-cam-footage-of-charlie-kirk.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> for <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-30"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s memorial service. I think there were 90,000 people that attended and then spilled over. And many people online have speculated—accurately, by the way, some credit to you guys—that in order to book a venue of that size, you would have had to have done so in advance, right? Venue contracts do not just materialize out of nowhere for a space that holds that many people plus spillover. ^t-00-01-30

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-02-10.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:10</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=130" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Now, given my many sources at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, I was able to quickly get an answer on that one for the public. The venue was indeed secured in quick order, but that was because they had help from the <span id="ent-org-white-house-t-00-02-10"><a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a></span>, and <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> did not book that venue back in May, so we can formally debunk that. I was told that the <a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a> stepped in and put in a personal phone call to the event coordinator. And they actually did already have an event that was scheduled. And the <a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a> simply asked those people if they would be willing to move or reschedule their event. It was apparently supposed to be an RV show, actually. And obviously, given the nature of the tragedy, it was globally traumatizing to everybody. ^t-00-02-10

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-02-54.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:54</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=174" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I think everybody was moved by <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-54"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s assassination. The people that held that space were willing to oblige it. So that tracks with me. That seems accurate. I just wanted to help you guys with that information. Also, another thing that I came across, and this is regarding <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-02-54"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span>'s campaign website. You guys were asking me if we came across that. Yes, I did come across that, and<a href="/events/event-2024-06-06-george-zin-endorsement-appears-on-phil-lyman-s-cam.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a> I actually in the short run didn't think much of it because I thought, okay, well, he was running a campaign and he has a website and maybe people were writing in reviews and saying he was a great person. But yes, we were aware that <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-02-54"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zin</a></span> is one of just 20 people that is a featured endorsement. He endorses <a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a>'s character.<span id="event-event-2024-06-06-george-zin-endorsement-appears-on-phil-lyman-s-cam-t-00-02-54"><a href="/events/event-2024-06-06-george-zin-endorsement-appears-on-phil-lyman-s-cam.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-02-54

Phil has a knowledge of urban and rural <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a> from every corner and community. <a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a> is in desperate need of true leadership and representation and Phil has the passion and the values to be a great governor. He needs our support." Now, I'm not sure what to make of that. I did want to use Wayback Machine to see whether or not that was a new entry.<span id="event-event-2025-05-01-governor-spencer-cox-appoints-judge-tony-f-graf-jr-t-00-03-37"><a href="/events/event-2025-05-01-governor-spencer-cox-appoints-judge-tony-f-graf-jr.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> Maybe somebody is trolling there.

Now, I will say other locals told us that <span id="ent-person-george-zinn-t-00-04-22"><a href="/entities/person-george-zinn.md">George Zin</a></span>, for whatever reason, is very involved in Republican politics. Take from that what you will, meaning that he shows up to a lot of events. But of course, <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-04-22"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span>'s people would have been controlling that website, certainly should have been aware of his erratic character, and maybe wouldn't want to have featured him on that website. I don't know. It's definitely something to consider. Some other things that are of interest, okay? Yesterday, we mentioned that apparently it was kind of everybody's first day on the job, right? ^t-00-04-22

So it's very strange. I think it would be interesting to learn whether or not that new CEO and surgeon worked on <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>.

That has been confirmed. An autopsy did take place. By the way, you should know that in the state of <span id="ent-gpe-utah-t-00-06-59"><a href="/entities/gpe-utah.md">Utah</a></span>, in case you, like me, are maybe holding your breath that we're going to see that report, those reports are actually kept private. So there isn't going to be some big release outside of what maybe the immediate family members wishing for that and saying, "I feel like something's wrong and I would now like to release the autopsy report." That's the only way that we are going to be able to see it. That's at least what I've learned. Now let's jump back into what actually took place on that day, because I'm starting to get a bit of a stronger hunch about things. ^t-00-06-59

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-07-42.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:42</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=462" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** We'll jump back in here regarding <span id="ent-person-skyler-t-00-07-42"><a href="/entities/person-skyler.md">Skyler</a></span> Broderick, who is, according to <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-07-42"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span>, a cousin, who he refers to Phil as his uncle across interviews. Doesn't matter. They're family members, is the main point, and they know each other. And <a href="/entities/person-skyler.md">Skyler</a> Broderick has, of course, mysteriously deleted all of his socials, except for <span id="ent-org-instagram-t-00-07-42"><a href="/entities/org-instagram.md">Instagram</a></span>, but he's wiped his <a href="/entities/org-instagram.md">Instagram</a>, okay? Just deleted his Facebook and just outright deleted his LinkedIn page because I asked him a question before we even went live. That was his response, okay? Now, he did this not before I grabbed everything that I needed from his pages. I just had a suspicion ^t-00-07-42

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-08-24.md" class="timestamp-link">00:08:24</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=504" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** that he might not be willing to participate. And I was operating under the assumption that he might just privatize his socials. So I instructed my team to grab everything before I even made contact. Now, what I did not anticipate was that he would delete the content. Why would he delete the content? That part never was tracking for me. It didn't make sense to me. Now, it sort of maybe does make a lot of sense to me. So you will recall that we had received a lead live on the show. Someone paid money to inform us that there was footage that the FBI was hiding, right? She wrote in, said, "I have been trying to reach out to you everywhere. The FBI is hiding footage.<span id="event-event-2025-09-11-tmz-publishes-doorbell-cam-footage-of-charlie-kirk-t-00-08-24"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-11-tmz-publishes-doorbell-cam-footage-of-charlie-kirk.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-08-24

This is what the person told us. She said, the shooter is then seen changing his clothes, and he is with a woman, she told me. Then she gives me a name, and that name was another Lyman family member, and that's when my spidey senses started tingling. I'm like, okay, this is a lot of Lymans now. I want to be very clear and fair to <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-09-08"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span>. He has been forthcoming about the fact that his family owned that property. Like, they own everything there. That is not mysterious. He's not hiding that fact. <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-09-08"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span> in many ways purchased the university from his family, right?

Be able to speak to his family members. And yeah, I didn't want to come out and say that it was a fact that the woman, that there was a woman with the shooter without any proof. We had no proof outside of this person, and what she was saying felt real to me, definitively, but I needed something more solid. Well, we came across something more solid. We reviewed the footage that <span id="ent-person-skyler-t-00-09-49"><a href="/entities/person-skyler.md">Skyler</a></span> brought. Of course, we downloaded everything but hadn't actually reviewed it; had wiped from the internet. ^t-00-09-49

Now, to set this up, you will recall that <span id="ent-person-skyler-t-00-10-33"><a href="/entities/person-skyler.md">Skyler</a></span> and his close friends that nobody knows, apparently, they were retracing the footsteps of the killer. They were at his grandma's house, he said, and he's speaking on camera with his aunt. To set this footage up for you, and sure enough, you're gonna hear right in the beginning, his aunt is going to mention that there was a woman who was helping the shooter, and she's not sure whether or not that person was an accomplice. I would say if you're helping, you're helping the shooter. ^t-00-10-33

(Following clip is from <span id="ent-person-skyler-t-00-11-20"><a href="/entities/person-skyler.md">Skyler</a></span> Broderick’s aunt.) If you can't time how long it took him to get from that little part over here was way longer than it should have taken. So I wondered if the girl had given him stuff, like if there is an accomplice. ^t-00-11-20

And she says, I was wondering if the girl had given him stuff. And then somebody off camera says, you know you're filming. And she says, I'm sorry that you're filming. But it's very clear. There's no question at all. In fact, leading into that, which we should have maybe cut that a little bit earlier, they're speaking about how she thought the FBI had it wrong. The timing didn't make sense to her. And that's what she started with. The timing doesn't make sense to me because I thought that it took a little longer for him to walk. Let's play that again, <span id="ent-person-skyler-t-00-11-42"><a href="/entities/person-skyler.md">Skyler</a></span>, just so they can hear it again. She says that there's a girl. Take a listen. ^t-00-11-42

That's AI. She's saying, I wondered if there is an accomplice. I wondered if there is an accomplice, which we should edit that, Chris, when we re-release that. And then somebody says something, something, and she's like, sorry, I didn't realize you were filming. Okay. So we have the woman who was my source who said that the FBI cut the footage, and she was certain of it. And now we have actually the woman who handed over her footage to the FBI saying, I wondered if that woman was an accomplice. Ladies and gentlemen, what the heck is going on? Who was the woman that was with the alleged shooter? ^t-00-12-35

Now, again, you should recall that the very next morning on September the 11th, TMZ already had the doorbell cam footage, okay? So that means that the FBI already had the footage, right? They would have seen that there was a woman with the shooter, and yet they chose during this manhunt, during this 33-hour manhunt, not to inform the public that they were also looking for a woman who this lady believes, she wondered whether or not she would have been an accomplice, if that was his accomplice. What happened to this lady? ^t-00-13-19

I don't know, what are your ideas here? Why would the FBI not tell us something so evidently crucial to this story, that we have a woman that's involved? What's she look like? How old is she? I obviously did the sensible thing, right? I reached out to <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-14-03"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span> because it's his family. And I asked him whether or not he would be willing to track down this footage for me. And he's not happy with me. He's angry. I mean, he said really not nice things to me. He started asking me if I had something to do with the shooting. Okay. ^t-00-14-03

He's very upset about cousin versus nephew thing. It's all irrelevant. If you're saying you actually want to help us catch the killer, right? If that's really where your heart was, if that's really why you injected yourself so much into this story, why wouldn't you, knowing how deeply I care about this, walk over while you're in the neighborhood popping by, walk over to your aunt, grandma, cousins, I don't care whose house, and say, hey, you said there was an accomplice, that there was a woman, okay, that might've been an accomplice. Do you mind letting me see the raw footage so that I can hand it over to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-14-46"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>? ^t-00-14-46

Why did they rush to give it to TMZ? By the way, you definitely said you were at your cousin's house and that you hadn't seen the footage. You were watching it live with <span id="ent-person-kayleigh-mcenany-t-00-15-29"><a href="/entities/person-kayleigh-mcenany.md">Kayleigh McEnany</a></span> on <span id="ent-org-fox-news-t-00-15-29"><a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a></span>. That's what you said during that segment, right? This is the first time I'm seeing this footage. So apparently, your cousin, close enough to go to their house, but your cousin decides to give the footage to TMZ before you can even see it. Okay, maybe <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-15-29"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span> gave it. That's another assumption. That's the only two options. Either your cousin gave it to TMZ, or <a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a> gave a portion of it to TMZ, which begs the question, why were we not told about the woman? Who was the woman? ^t-00-15-29

So why are they worried about that being caught on camera? Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you were filming. What's that about? It's like everybody knows something that I don't know. And I wanna be in the know on what happened to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-16-14"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> on 9/10. So if you have any tips pertaining to who the woman was that was caught, please let me know. I am going to try again to reach out to this family since I don't think that <span id="ent-person-phil-lyman-t-00-16-14"><a href="/entities/person-phil-lyman.md">Phil Lyman</a></span> wants to assist me. He doesn't like me. That's fine. I wonder if he likes truth. ^t-00-16-14

If he doesn't want to talk to me, I'm happy to put him in touch with another journalist. But if you know something more and you'd like to reach out to us, please do. You can reach out to us on social media. And I please ask again that you guys reserve not sending us videos and TikToks and links, but rather, if you have information, please use tips@candaceowens.com. I love you all. And I love that the whole world wants to know what happened. And I'm grateful for that. But there is just so much data that an inbox can take. And we might have to just make a second line, is what I think we should do. <span id="ent-person-skylar-t-00-16-58"><a href="/entities/person-skylar.md">Skylar</a></span>, we should talk about that. Okay, now we turn our attention back to the mysterious individual that is next to <span id="ent-person-skyler-t-00-16-58"><a href="/entities/person-skyler.md">Skyler</a></span>, right? ^t-00-16-58

He could not help identify him. I told you it was unusual that our inbox wasn't instantly flooded with people telling us exactly who it was. Well, then we did get another hit on him, and a handful of you similarly found the same person that we did, a person going by the name <span id="ent-person-robbie-hilde-t-00-17-40"><a href="/entities/person-robbie-hilde.md">Robbie Hilde</a></span>, who was allegedly from <span id="ent-gpe-washington-state-t-00-17-40"><a href="/entities/gpe-washington-state.md">Washington</a></span>.

They're all just saying, I got a hit. I got a hit. This might be him. No one is saying they went to school with him. This is a young college student. He's allegedly, like I said, from <a href="/entities/gpe-washington-state.md">Washington</a> State. And no one personally can say, I know this person. How could that be? How could that be? I'm going to tell you something because I'm starting to get a hunch about things, and we're going to go more deeply into this tomorrow. ^t-00-18-19

There seems to be some organized movement, people that are being given new identities. Actually, one person wrote to us and told us that <span id="ent-org-utah-valley-university-t-00-18-55"><a href="/entities/org-utah-valley-university.md">UVU</a></span>, in and of itself, as a campus, has an unbelievable amount of dedication. I mean, even the president, I'm blanking on her name, majored in Soviet studies. They have a direct pipeline from <span id="ent-gpe-russia-t-00-18-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-russia.md">Russia</a></span> to <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-18-55"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>.

He's a military man. And that gets really interesting when I start to combine all of the aspects of this case, and again, we are still in theory territory, but I feel like we are in strong, I'm starting to get a stronger than a theory and more of a hunch that this was a military operation and people that executed this are actually from overseas. ^t-00-19-30

Oh, we need to have open borders. It allows them to get in people that are perhaps completely insane and deranged. And they are in fact raising little militants and they're executing these programs.

Spiritually, that feels right to me. I've been pleading with you guys to get your kids out of these schools.

That's why our kids had to go. We couldn't get basic answers about somebody that had kind of fallen through the cracks and was posting Polish underground symbols. Her parent was posting Polish underground symbols, and I realized something was wrong. Something was off. I'm showing you this; this is like one headline, and this is translated from <span id="ent-gpe-russia-t-00-21-40"><a href="/entities/gpe-russia.md">Russian</a></span>, by the way.

Over the years, we've all seen some tough times. We've had skyrocketing inflation, surging national debt, market volatility, and never-ending wars. Gold is real, it's tangible, and it's held value for thousands of years. Unlike the stock market or currency, gold doesn't vanish when politicians make bad decisions, which, if we're being honest, is happening a lot these days, and that's exactly why I've been partnering with the award-winning company GoldCo, because they sell precious metals like gold and silver, and they do an amazing job with it. So whether you're worried about inflation, government spending, or you just want peace of mind, GoldCo makes it easy. Here's what you can do.

How do you feel about <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-46-47"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler</a></span>'s legal team? I've not explored that. I have been so hyper-focused. I know you guys have been like, have you seen this? Have you seen that? I want to solve who did this, right? And I want to do it in a way that makes sense to me. I'm a timeline person. I'm very good at gathering data and intel, vetting that information that I'm getting, and sharing it with the public in a way that they can digest. There's a lot of different rabbit holes that should be chased. That's definitely one of them. But my main focus right now is trying to figure out who else was involved on that day. Who is the lady that was in that photo?<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve-t-00-46-47"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span><span id="event-event-2025-09-30-turning-point-usa-holds-event-at-utah-state-univer-t-00-46-47"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-30-turning-point-usa-holds-event-at-utah-state-univer.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-46-47

They share a building—just, FBI and <a href="/entities/org-anti-defamation-league.md">ADL</a> share a building. They're one and the same. I hope you guys know that. They share a building, I think, in <span id="ent-gpe-connecticut-t-00-47-25"><a href="/entities/gpe-connecticut.md">Connecticut</a></span>. Also, <span id="ent-gpe-israel-t-00-47-25"><a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israel</a></span> is taking over ExpressVPN and other VPN websites. I always had a conspiracy about that. I used to read ads for them, ExpressVPN, when I was working for <span id="ent-org-the-daily-wire-t-00-47-25"><a href="/entities/org-the-daily-wire.md">Daily Wire</a></span>. And in back of my mind, I was like, it would make sense that they would train us to actually filter. There's so much data. So they're like, actually, why don't you pretend that this VPN hides things and so that we know exactly where to look? And once I found that it was started by an <a href="/entities/gpe-israel.md">Israeli</a> billionaire, I was like, yeah, no, that's gonna be a spying thing. That's how I felt, at least. ^t-00-47-25

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-adJ4LNGp84I/t-00-48-10.md" class="timestamp-link">00:48:10</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adJ4LNGp84I&t=2890" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I was like, they're just gonna see what you wanna hide and go straight there. So you're basically taking on the process of filtering for them. That's my conspiracy theory. One of many that I have, as you guys know, because you listen to the show. Lily writes, first they made a false statement about <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-48-10"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> not being friends with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-48-10"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. They pushed through their minions in the media. Now they planted a fake letter in the same <span id="ent-org-new-york-post-t-00-48-10"><a href="/entities/org-new-york-post.md">New York Post</a></span> and their minions. <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> must be up to something. Yeah, I know who had access to <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">s</a> laptop. And I have questions about that, but I'm going to wait for the financial report to come out, which I'm not handling. And I got question marks about a couple of people over at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-48-10"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. And yeah, I think we should definitely be speaking about these shady pastors. I hope this is the year of the shady pastor. ^t-00-48-10

There's nothing that's spoken about what <a href="/entities/concept-christians.md">Christians</a> are going through. And they flood money into that and they get you to say that it's like a fellowship program. But then they have you, like, gathering pastors and paying off people. I mean, it's an ugly business. And I think it's about to all get exposed. I think it was a bad idea to kill <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-48-55"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. That's what I think. I think the <span id="ent-concept-devil-t-00-48-55"><a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a></span> overplayed his hand because that's what the <a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a> does. The <a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a> is arrogant. The <a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a> has no friends. ^t-00-48-55

And what I mean by that is if you pledge allegiance to the <a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a>, just so you know, he will turn on you too, okay? You're only as useful to him as you are an idiot to him. If you're willing to do his bidding, he will play ball. And as soon as you are not, he does not care about you. You mean nothing to him. You are dealing with a true psychopathic individual who cares about nothing more than their own selfish goals. That's what I believe. Anyways, I want to again remind you guys that we have new merch. Finally, after so many messages, we made it happen. We should have done it sooner, obviously. We don't know, no, but we know. ^t-00-49-39

We will know now. I'm a <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-50-23"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> story. You can head to CandaceOwens.com. If you'd like to buy merch, that's how you can support the show. We actually are not funded by any outside groups. We are taking influence from nobody other than the people that write to our tips box. We are being heavily influenced by them. I will say that. And I remind you, please, please, we love you all, but only if you have a tip that can help us crack this mystery. I do think that we're gonna get into a <span id="ent-gpe-russia-t-00-50-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-russia.md">Russian</a></span> and <span id="ent-gpe-ukraine-t-00-50-23"><a href="/entities/gpe-ukraine.md">Ukrainian</a></span> angle here for some reason, some way, somehow. We'll see. See you guys tomorrow. ^t-00-50-23
