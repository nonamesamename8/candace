Happy Monday. I am back. I know you guys missed me because I definitely missed you more. And I feel so much better after getting out to the mountains. I've now, I think, officially accepted that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> is not coming back. And somehow it took me longer to get there. It took me longer to accept that fact than it did many others. Some people accepted it within just a matter of days. His quote-unquote closest friends, his closest political allies, the <span id="ent-org-white-house-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a></span>—they all seemed kind of ready to move on so much faster than I was. And now it's looking like some people even may have accepted <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s death within minutes. There was a video that is currently circulating of his chief of staff, <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-00-00"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>.<span id="event-event-2025-09-14-pastor-rob-mccoy-announces-charlie-kirk-s-successi-t-00-00-00"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-14-pastor-rob-mccoy-announces-charlie-kirk-s-successi.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-00-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=45" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It's going viral for a lot of reasons. We're gonna go through that video, and buckle up because I have an even more exclusive, never-before-seen video that I think is going to make your skin crawl. Plus, I have even more never-before-seen text messages from <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-45"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>. Incredibly, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> did in fact know that <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-45"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> was going to be the death of him. And I have proof of that. He also knew that I was the only person who was going to step up to defend him after he was gone. That sounds crazy, but it's the truth. So let's get started and welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-45"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. ^t-00-00-45

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-01-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=99" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** So here is where I was. I went to <span id="ent-gpe-wyoming-t-00-01-39"><a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a></span> to breathe, to hike, to listen to way too much <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-01-39"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a></span> music. I absolutely love the mountains. I am a mountain person, so to speak. <a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a> is in fact my favorite state in the union. And it felt fitting also because the first time I ever visited <a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a>, I was with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-39"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>. I then visited <a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a> many times thereafter over the years. And the last time I went to <a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a>, I was with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>. He was the last person I visited with, and it was for, ironically, <span id="ent-person-foster-friess-t-00-01-39"><a href="/entities/person-foster-friess.md">Foster Friess</a></span>'s funeral—who was a big-time donor to <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-01-39"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>, still is, I believe. ^t-00-01-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-02-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=140" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, I was thinking out there—remembering [he] paid for my flight to <span id="ent-gpe-wyoming-t-00-02-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a></span>. I had to get there very quickly because I was doing <span id="ent-person-joe-rogan-t-00-02-20"><a href="/entities/person-joe-rogan.md">Joe Rogan</a></span>'s podcast, which was huge. I didn't even know what the <a href="/entities/person-joe-rogan.md">Joe Rogan</a> podcast was at that moment. That's how I was so not politically inclined at all. And he's like, "This is the biggest podcast. You got to do this." I completely bombed it, by the way. I was so nervous. I think I said "um" like 3000 times. But then I had to very quickly get over to <a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a> because <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-02-20"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span> had invited me to his album release party. And again, ironically, where he held that album release party would be where years later <span id="ent-person-foster-friess-t-00-02-20"><a href="/entities/person-foster-friess.md">Foster Friess</a></span> would have his funeral. And so <a href="/entities/gpe-wyoming.md">Wyoming</a> felt fitting. I fished while I was out there. ^t-00-02-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-03-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=183" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And so I want you guys to know another fun fact about <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-03"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>. He hated fishing. He absolutely loved the mountains. He loved hiking. He was quite the athlete, but he hated fishing. It just was not his thing. And the same way that golf is just not my thing, fishing was not his. And this photo that I'm about to show you makes me laugh because we were in <span id="ent-gpe-british-columbia-t-00-03-03"><a href="/entities/gpe-british-columbia.md">British Columbia</a></span> fishing. And here's a photo of me and <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. And I was so excited about this catch. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s eyes are closed here. And as soon as—I think it was Don Jr.— it might've been <span id="ent-person-corey-lewandowski-t-00-03-03"><a href="/entities/person-corey-lewandowski.md">Corey Lewandowski</a></span>—hit flash, took the picture. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> just went, "I don't know why you guys like this," because he was too hyperactive. He always wanted to be planning and doing a million things at once. And fishing—fishing takes time. You got to set the bait. ^t-00-03-03

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-03-48.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:48</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=228" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It's now been 47 days since my friend <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-48"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> was executed in front of the world because that's what it was—a public execution. And call me crazy. Many people do. But I was so clearly deluded in the immediate aftermath of his death that I was operating under this delusion. I mean, I truly believed that I would be fighting for answers to what actually happened on 9/10, alongside <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s inner circle. I thought the band maybe was going to get back together. We were all going to maybe be on a group chat: me, <span id="ent-person-tyler-bowyer-t-00-03-48"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-bowyer.md">Tyler Bowyer</a></span>, <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-03-48"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span>, <span id="ent-person-stacey-sheridan-t-00-03-48"><a href="/entities/person-stacey-sheridan.md">Stacey Sheridan</a></span> even.<span id="event-event-2025-10-27-tyler-robinson-appears-in-court-via-zoom-without-s-t-00-03-48"><a href="/events/event-2025-10-27-tyler-robinson-appears-in-court-via-zoom-without-s.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-03-48

She's like the chief money person, essentially, at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-04-27"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. She was brought in to reel in the big donors. I remember exactly when that happened. All of those people, by the way, were actually brought in by <span id="ent-person-tyler-bowyer-t-00-04-27"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-bowyer.md">Tyler Bowyer</a></span>. He's a very important character in this story, but we're gonna get into all of that tomorrow. The point that I'm making here is that I had assumed—clearly, wrongly—that we'd all maybe be on a group chat, communicating, raising hell, and demanding answers from <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-04-27"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span>, from the police, from the <span id="ent-org-white-house-t-00-04-27"><a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a></span>, even. Certainly, at the very least, pointing out the very many holes in this story. ^t-00-04-27

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-05-11.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:11</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=311" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And if any of us, any one of us, had the audacity or the desire to carry on <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-11"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span>'s show, that would be the appropriate venue for asking those sorts of questions. But no. I was wrong. Silence. Silence is what we were met with. In fact, I am told that these people believe the official narrative: lone shooter. No one else involved, just a crazy guy with too many pronouns in his bio. In 1963 called, and they want their narrative back. All that's missing from the story is a grassy knoll, right? Just need a grassy knoll. Anyways, back at headquarters, I am told it's business as usual. ^t-00-05-11

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-05-52.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:52</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=352" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And it's kind of giving me like—I don't know—<span id="ent-person-lyndon-baines-johnson-t-00-05-52"><a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">LBJ</a></span> when he gets sworn in in that famous picture. Unfortunately, sworn in. Unfortunately, of course, he's sad in this photo. Gosh, he's obviously not wanting to be the president of the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-05-52"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">United States</a></span>. <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-05-52"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span> was shot and killed, and now <a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">LBJ</a> has to step up, unfortunately. But I gotta be honest. I wasn't there. I don't think <a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">LBJ</a> was actually that upset. I don't know why. Vibes. The vibes just aren't vibing for me in that picture. But maybe, maybe he was. Maybe the truth is that <a href="/entities/person-lyndon-baines-johnson.md">LBJ</a> simply—to use an expression—had his wits about him. ^t-00-05-52

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-06-36.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:36</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=396" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And <span id="ent-person-john-f-kennedy-t-00-06-36"><a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a></span> had a plan. Like, in the event that he had been horrifically assassinated in front of the world, <a href="/entities/person-john-f-kennedy.md">JFK</a> maybe had a <span id="ent-work-succession-t-00-06-36"><a href="/entities/work-succession.md">succession</a></span> plan. Now, if these terms I'm using here sound familiar to you, it's because they should sound familiar. It's the exact terminology that was utilized by Pastor <span id="ent-person-rob-mccoy-t-00-06-36"><a href="/entities/person-rob-mccoy.md">Rob McCoy</a></span> just four days after <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-36"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was murdered. In front of his congregation, he spoke about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s <a href="/entities/work-succession.md">succession</a> plan that he was somehow privy to. I don't know why, but he knew four days later and announced to the world that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> indeed had a plan. Take a listen. ^t-00-06-36

I mean, amazing. So on September 14th, we were made aware of this <span id="ent-work-succession-t-00-07-38"><a href="/entities/work-succession.md">succession</a></span> plan.<span id="event-event-2025-09-14-succession-plan-at-turning-point-usa-mad-t-00-07-38"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-14-succession-plan-at-turning-point-usa-mad.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> And I find that to be fascinating. The people who didn't even know <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-38"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> all around the world seem to be fighting harder for him, fighting harder for truth.

And the minute <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-25"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> got shot, he called.

Now why is that precise timing so important? Because there's no dialing. <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> didn't have time to dial, okay? You can't dial and put your phone to your ear in 0.834 seconds. The next time that you're gonna see <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a>, as we just showed you, is in just under two and a half seconds on the other side of the tent.

Yeah, when the clip was brought to my attention, I obviously have a file—a big folder of files—of every angle, and I decided to track <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> from every angle available to see like maybe we just missed it and he did at some point put that phone down, dial a number, speed dial, hold down one—I don't know. Maybe we missed it because that seems automatic, right? ^t-00-11-16

And no, no, he doesn't do that. We even have him in front of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-11-59"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s car. When <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> is brought to the car—the waiting car, rather—he is still on the phone. I can show you the clip of that. Take a look at this. Don't worry. We'll slow it down for you. See him in the background with the backpack? It's <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-11-59"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>. Okay. So what are we to make of that? The only logical conclusion that I can come up with—and many others, because I've pressed—I said, "Play <span id="ent-concept-devil-t-00-11-59"><a href="/entities/concept-devil.md">devil</a></span>'s advocate.

What was he doing? How did he do it this quickly? No one could do this. The only logical conclusion we come up with was that <a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey</a> was already on a phone call at 12:23 p.m. He was already on a phone call. So I said, "Let's go back a little earlier in the footage and see if we can find when he actually maybe dials onto the phone. Maybe we can see him pick up the phone and begin a call before the shot goes off. And then, after being on that call—if we're following this logic—that would mean he puts his phone down until <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-12-41"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> gets shot."

And you're gonna see he pulls it up, and he starts to cover his ear again. Now, could be unrelated. Again, we're taking a guess here. That's what made the most sense to us because we couldn't justify it in any other way. And I wanna be clear: we're not here to make assumptions, okay?

The point is that I hit college campuses with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-15-56"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> for six years. I don't believe that there was a single living, breathing person who has spoken at more college campuses alongside <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> than me. So I knew that things were weird when I saw, first and foremost, the camera guy—the one who takes down the camera. Seeing him lingering alongside <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> at the event flagged me as weird immediately. Okay? That's why I reached out when people saw, "I'm taking down the camera." I said, "What is this? Why are you here? Literally, why are you standing next to... ^t-00-15-56

Okay? Sometimes he wasn't even there. Other times, of course, when you are in AV, your job is to be somewhere quiet. Your job is to have on like headphones to make sure the audio is good. Maybe the idea that they're miking—the person running a company is miking you up—is completely absurd. I didn't like it. It felt new to me. And you know what? When I called him, things got pretty weird. He acknowledged that a lot of new stuff was happening on that day.

I don't know why he was lying to me, but a lot of the things that he said didn't make sense. And I'm gonna speak more thoroughly about what it was that he said because, obviously, I recorded the phone call. I, of course, asked him why he took down the cameras so quickly. I asked him to, first and foremost, simply show me the footage because that's all I wanted to do. I'm thinking again, we're all going to get the band back together and solve this murder. And it got weird. It got really weird. I said, "I just want to see the footage so I can debunk. I know that you don't want to put more footage out there. That's fine.

And I asked him again, like, "What's the reason? What's the reason for taking down the cameras quickly? Why hasn't the footage been released? Let me see it." And he told me that, A, he had spoken only to <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-18-03"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> and <span id="ent-org-fbi-t-00-18-03"><a href="/entities/org-fbi.md">the feds</a></span> that he had regarding the footage—that is. He specifically told me that—as I said earlier—that he had secured that footage because he wanted to prevent <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a>—as I told you—from having to relive that moment.

I told you guys because we all can watch <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-18-03"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a></span> be murdered over and over and over and over and over again.

So it was the least traumatizing footage of all. Why be so secretive about it?

I said, "Okay, fine." I let him take a couple of days off, and then we got back on the phone, and I said, "Look, that's kind of a BS excuse too because you run your own company, and the footage is owned by you." He then said, "Okay, yeah, I do own the footage. I just wanted—you know—just coordinate, check, whatever." Okay. Kind of a lie number two-ish.

He told me—and this is when I was extremely uncomfortable. He said, after I offered, "You can just use WeTransfer," "I don't wanna just send the footage over the internet—that's behind <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-19-32"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s head—because I'm worried that <span id="ent-org-google-t-00-19-32"><a href="/entities/org-google.md">Google</a></span> might hack me."

What a stupid lie." So I said to him, I said, "Let's just pretend that that does happen for whatever reason—Sergey Brin is sitting around, and he's going, 'I want to hack this person because I want to see footage behind <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-20-16"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s head.'"

He wanted people to live-cut the clips so that they could be the first people to get it on the internet. He didn't want to—he's like, not even a second to be wasted. So live-streaming to everybody can watch, but they were racing some people to get the clips out faster than anybody else because <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s ambitious."

He had such a political vision for me. I never wanted that sort of a thing. "I see it so freaking clearly. I might be Moses though. I might not see this whole thing through, LMAO. If that is the case, be my David." I said, "Dude, you haven't even realized your power yet." You're so young, is what I was thinking.

In the same way that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> knew he was going to die young, I knew that this was a part of something bigger.

I would recommend that you come clean because <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> said some other things, and I look at these things now, and I think, "Wow, it's almost prophetic, right?

In fact, instead of trying to make me shut up, you should do something else. I think your time would be better spent trying to stop the sun from rising. You'd have more success if you spent your time trying to stop the sun from rising than trying to get me to shut up about who killed <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> because he knew he was going to die, and he knew that I was going to be the person that had the spine to stand up for him. ^t-00-43-50

Yay. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is quote-unquote "moderately effective" at best—and that's not even accounting for the vaccine injuries.

Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from <span id="ent-org-the-wellness-company-t-00-45-11"><a href="/entities/org-the-wellness-company.md">The Wellness Company</a></span>. If you wake up with a sore throat or you have a runny nose, you can address those symptoms right away with a doctor-prescribed kit that contains ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, generic Tamiflu, generic Z-Pak—much more. It's like having an urgent care clinic in your home. I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from <a href="/entities/org-the-wellness-company.md">The Wellness Company</a> because I refuse to be trapped in line at an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. ^t-00-45-11

And, of course, I want to tell you guys about Nimi Skin Care. You know I love them for years. The beauty industry kind of convinced us that we need complex formulas to achieve healthy skin, but the secret to healthy skin is actually a lot simpler. That's why I was very interested when I found Nimi Skin Care. Nimi is doing something radical. They've built one of their most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth, which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is traditional. It's an ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils, which means that your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Nimi has two products from their tallow line that you should definitely know about. ^t-00-47-19

This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling. They've combined that incredible grass-fed tallow with soothing aloe vera—I love aloe vera—and jojoba oil. It's perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind. Then for the problem areas—for the really dry, cracked skin—they have the Buzzy Tallow Balm. It's an ultra-rich balm that uses tallow and beeswax to create a protective barrier. It locks in moisture. It shields your skin from the elements and allows it to heal. This is skin care the way that it was meant to be—which is simple, pure, powerfully effective. It's a focus on skin-loving ingredients made right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-48-03"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span>. So go to <span id="ent-org-nimi-skincare-t-00-48-03"><a href="/entities/org-nimi-skincare.md">nimiskincare.com</a></span>, explore their tallow line, and don't forget to use my code CANDACE10 at checkout, and you'll get 10% off your order. ^t-00-48-03

It was actually <span id="ent-person-scott-adams-t-00-52-22"><a href="/entities/person-scott-adams.md">Scott Adams</a></span>, who did a video that I'll never forget when that happened. And he said like it ripped a hole in the universe—this tweet—and it was never supposed to happen. I'm going to dig that up, find it, and speak more about what my experience was—where I do genuinely believe that handlers were sent out. And I got lucky that I had this overwhelming spiritual feeling that needed to go to the UK, and I met my husband. ^t-00-52-22

I'm sure no one at <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-52-57"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> will think that's weird. They're just like, "It's open.

Ivana Milano writes, "Keep up the great work. Stand by your friend—reminding us that this isn't just a personal struggle, but a spiritual war." Yes, it is. In a world where money and greed are taking over people's lives, thank you for helping us to stay grounded in God's truth. Yes. It is worth losing money—as I did. It is worth losing fake friends—as I did—to stand up for the truth. And I'm just ready for war with these people. Like, all of it—band together, you know? Send your best warriors because all they ever do is lie and smear and delude and take away and deplatform—and you're not winning anymore. And something that I want to say that's also so amazing is I didn't have to fight hard this time for people to believe me. And I don't know. I just know that somewhere <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-53-40"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s energy—they tried to almost like capture it very quickly. ^t-00-53-40

They can't create. They aren't the life force. These people are not the life force. They can only steal. They can threaten. They can pressure. But they can't create it. I feel now—as I was reflecting on things—that they all were trying to bottle up <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-54-26"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s energy, and <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> sent his energy where it needed to be. I barely defended myself as they came out—attacked, lied: "She didn't even speak to him since <span id="ent-date-2017-t-00-54-26"><a href="/entities/date-2017.md">2017</a></span>. She didn't know <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. She hasn't seen him." They just lied and lied and lied and lied. And nobody from <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-54-26"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> defended me and said like, "That's a lie. And what she's saying is true." And the public— ^t-00-54-26

The amount of money that was spent on telling those lies—and I barely had to defend myself—and you guys knew that I was telling the truth. And I think that that's incredible—that it truly is a testament to God and is a testament to truth. And as <span id="ent-person-ian-carroll-t-00-55-08"><a href="/entities/person-ian-carroll.md">Ian Carroll</a></span> said when I had him on my show, the truth doesn't need to be repeated over and over again. It's the power of the frequency of truth, right? It takes a lot of little lies. It's why the lie demands the truth shuts up. It's the reason they pass speech laws. They need people to be quiet because when you start speaking the truth, it becomes more powerful. I truly believe that, and I'm calling upon everyone to do that more often: like, just speak the truth even if you're fearful of the consequence because the bigger consequence is not being right with God when you pass. ^t-00-55-08

God bless. Thank you so much." Caitlin writes, "My brother H.M. passed away in 2021. He often spoke about how he knew he was not going to live past 40 years. He was saying this when he was in his 20s, and he was 41." Yeah. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> said a lot more. He said a lot more, and I'm gonna keep it close because I do think a part of it was prophecy. Now I really do believe that, and I'm gonna see this thing to the end. David Foster wrote, "I didn't even know <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, and I was more shook up seeing the footage than the camera guy seemed in a selfie video.

It just does not add up. It doesn't add up, and we've got to stop accepting this excuse of like, "Well, what would you do?" I do know what I would do, okay? In your situation, you either run far, and you don't record yourself, right? Or you go run towards your friend, and you help. In fact, the only person—as <span id="ent-person-ian-carroll-t-00-56-33"><a href="/entities/person-ian-carroll.md">Ian Carroll</a></span> pointed out in one of his videos, and you should subscribe to <a href="/entities/person-ian-carroll.md">Ian Carroll</a>'s channel— as well. He pointed out that like the only person who was acting right was <span id="ent-person-frank-turek-t-00-56-33"><a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank Turek</a></span>. Like, the first thing you do is get down, right? Because you don't know if there's going to be another shot. How was <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-56-33"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span> confident enough to stay standing and walking? Nobody knows. You don't know where the shot's coming from. You don't see him get shot. The first thing you would do is drop to the ground. That's like the first normal thing to do is to get low, get—make sure you're safe. ^t-00-56-33

Like, all of that feels normal to me, okay? And they're always trying to make us see things through the exception: "Well, there was this one time at band camp— or rather exceptionally—someone fired shots, and someone was just really calm and walking away." And I'm like, yeah, I've seen Men in Black. That's not the person you should trust in this scenario, is all I'm saying. Brian writes, "Come back, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-57-17"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>. Everyone needs—welcome back, <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>. Pardon. Everyone needs a friend like you who would fight with such fire for justice.
