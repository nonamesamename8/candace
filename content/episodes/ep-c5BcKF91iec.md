**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=0" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:00</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-00-00.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** All right, you guys. Happy Monday. I am back. I know you guys missed me because I definitely missed you more. And I feel so much better after getting out to the mountains. I've now, I think, officially accepted that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is not coming back. And somehow it took me longer to get there. It took me longer to accept that fact than it did many others. Some people accepted it within just a matter of days. His quote-unquote closest friends, his closest political allies, the White House—they all seemed kind of ready to move on so much faster than I was. And now it's looking like some people even may have accepted Charlie's death within minutes. There was a video that is currently circulating of his chief of staff, Mikey McCoy. ^t-00-00-00

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=45" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:00:45</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-00-45.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's going viral for a lot of reasons. We're gonna go through that video, and buckle up because I have an even more exclusive, never-before-seen video that I think is going to make your skin crawl. Plus, I have even more never-before-seen text messages from Charlie Kirk. Incredibly, Charlie Kirk did in fact know that Turning Point was going to be the death of him. And I have proof of that. He also knew that I was the only person who was going to step up to defend him after he was gone. That sounds crazy, but it's the truth. So let's get started and welcome back to Candace. ^t-00-00-45

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=99" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:01:39</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-01-39.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So here is where I was. I went to Wyoming to breathe, to hike, to listen to way too much Kanye West music. I absolutely love the mountains. I am a mountain person, so to speak. Wyoming is in fact my favorite state in the union. And it felt fitting also because the first time I ever visited Wyoming, I was with Charlie Kirk. I then visited Wyoming many times thereafter over the years. And the last time I went to Wyoming, I was with Charlie Kirk. He was the last person I visited with, and it was for, ironically, Foster Friess's funeral—who was a big-time donor to Turning Point USA, still is, I believe. ^t-00-01-39

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=140" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:02:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-02-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Charlie, I was thinking out there—remembering [he] paid for my flight to Wyoming. I had to get there very quickly because I was doing Joe Rogan's podcast, which was huge. I didn't even know what the Joe Rogan podcast was at that moment. That's how I was so not politically inclined at all. And he's like, "This is the biggest podcast. You got to do this." I completely bombed it, by the way. I was so nervous. I think I said "um" like 3000 times. But then I had to very quickly get over to Wyoming because Kanye had invited me to his album release party. And again, ironically, where he held that album release party would be where years later Foster Friess would have his funeral. And so Wyoming felt fitting. I fished while I was out there. ^t-00-02-20

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=183" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-03-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And so I want you guys to know another fun fact about Charlie Kirk. He hated fishing. He absolutely loved the mountains. He loved hiking. He was quite the athlete, but he hated fishing. It just was not his thing. And the same way that golf is just not my thing, fishing was not his. And this photo that I'm about to show you makes me laugh because we were in British Columbia fishing. And here's a photo of me and Charlie. And I was so excited about this catch. Charlie's eyes are closed here. And as soon as—I think it was Don Jr.— it might've been Corey Lewandowski—hit flash, took the picture. Charlie just went, "I don't know why you guys like this," because he was too hyperactive. He always wanted to be planning and doing a million things at once. And fishing—fishing takes time. You got to set the bait. ^t-00-03-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=228" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:03:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-03-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** It's now been 47 days since my friend Charlie Kirk was executed in front of the world because that's what it was—a public execution. And call me crazy. Many people do. But I was so clearly deluded in the immediate aftermath of his death that I was operating under this delusion. I mean, I truly believed that I would be fighting for answers to what actually happened on 9/10, alongside Charlie's inner circle. I thought the band maybe was going to get back together. We were all going to maybe be on a group chat: me, Tyler Bowyer, Andrew Colvett, Stacey Sheridan even. ^t-00-03-48

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=267" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:04:27</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-04-27.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** If you're wondering who Stacey Sheridan is, by the way, she's the one who's holding the camera when Charlie's casket is being escorted off of Air Force Two. She's like the chief money person, essentially, at Turning Point USA. She was brought in to reel in the big donors. I remember exactly when that happened. All of those people, by the way, were actually brought in by Tyler Bowyer. He's a very important character in this story, but we're gonna get into all of that tomorrow. The point that I'm making here is that I had assumed—clearly, wrongly—that we'd all maybe be on a group chat, communicating, raising hell, and demanding answers from the feds, from the police, from the White House, even. Certainly, at the very least, pointing out the very many holes in this story. ^t-00-04-27

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=311" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-05-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And if any of us, any one of us, had the audacity or the desire to carry on Charlie Kirk's show, that would be the appropriate venue for asking those sorts of questions. But no. I was wrong. Silence. Silence is what we were met with. In fact, I am told that these people believe the official narrative: lone shooter. No one else involved, just a crazy guy with too many pronouns in his bio. In 1963 called, and they want their narrative back. All that's missing from the story is a grassy knoll, right? Just need a grassy knoll. Anyways, back at headquarters, I am told it's business as usual. ^t-00-05-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=352" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:05:52</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-05-52.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And it's kind of giving me like—I don't know—LBJ when he gets sworn in in that famous picture. Unfortunately, sworn in. Unfortunately, of course, he's sad in this photo. Gosh, he's obviously not wanting to be the president of the United States. JFK was shot and killed, and now LBJ has to step up, unfortunately. But I gotta be honest. I wasn't there. I don't think LBJ was actually that upset. I don't know why. Vibes. The vibes just aren't vibing for me in that picture. But maybe, maybe he was. Maybe the truth is that LBJ simply—to use an expression—had his wits about him. ^t-00-05-52

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=396" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:06:36</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-06-36.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And JFK had a plan. Like, in the event that he had been horrifically assassinated in front of the world, JFK maybe had a succession plan. Now, if these terms I'm using here sound familiar to you, it's because they should sound familiar. It's the exact terminology that was utilized by Pastor Rob McCoy just four days after Charlie was murdered. In front of his congregation, he spoke about Charlie's succession plan that he was somehow privy to. I don't know why, but he knew four days later and announced to the world that Charlie indeed had a plan. Take a listen. ^t-00-06-36

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=431" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:11</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-07-11.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** Everyone's worried about the leadership of TPUSA. Don't. He was wise enough at 31 to put together a plan for succession. It's very clear what they decided, and they're implementing it now. ^t-00-07-11

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=458" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:07:38</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-07-38.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Amazing. I mean, amazing. So on September 14th, we were made aware of this succession plan. And I find that to be fascinating. The people who didn't even know Charlie all around the world seem to be fighting harder for him, fighting harder for truth. And it is, in fact, thanks to people on the internet like Sam Parker, James Lee, Ian Carroll (Ian Carroll), Zeb Boykin, many others. And a video from September 10th has gone pretty viral, okay? So let's take a look at this. It's a video of, of course, Pastor Rob McCoy's son. His name is Mikey McCoy. ^t-00-07-38

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=500" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:20</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-08-20.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And you're gonna see what he does not in the seconds following Charlie getting shot, but in less than one second after Charlie gets shot. These are not seconds—less than one second. You're gonna watch what Mikey McCoy does. First, let's hear his daddy's version of the events. Take it away, Pastor McCoy. ^t-00-08-20

**🎤 SPEAKER_2**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=520" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:08:40</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-08-40.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_2:** As a father, I just—I wanna protect my son. And I thought, "I got a plan for you, son." He said, "Dad, that's not Charlie's plan." And you know what? I'm looking at my son who's 24 years old. Justin's the chief CFO—chief financial officer—and Mikey's the chief of staff. And I'm watching. The minute Charlie was shot, he called me. Says, "Dad, Charlie's been shot in the neck. Please call every pastor and pray." I said, "Okay, son." He has wits about him. He was just directing. He had blood all over him. ^t-00-08-40

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=565" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:25</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-09-25.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Two things I want you to remember here. You may have caught that, but he said, "I was watching." And the minute Charlie got shot, he called. And Mikey McCoy says to his dad, "Charlie's been shot. Pray for him." He says "the minute." Maybe he's being a little hyperbolic. We're gonna find out. I'd certainly like to find out. But he stops and says, "I was watching." Watching what exactly? What were you watching? I want you to remember that. It's rubbing me the wrong way. And I'm gonna tell you why that's rubbing me the wrong way in a little bit. But the bigger thing is that he says Mikey had blood all over him. ^t-00-09-25

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=597" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:09:57</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-09-57.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Except Mikey did not have blood anywhere near him because Mikey was behind the tent when Charlie got shot, and Mikey in less than a second does something that I find to be quite strange. He puts his phone to his ear, and he begins a conversation. So we're gonna watch that clip in its entirety. Mark is going to bring it in. ^t-00-09-57

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=634" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:10:34</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-10-34.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So we decided to slow this clip down, and we're gonna watch this clip slowed down so you can see that it is exactly 834 milliseconds from the time that you hear the shot. That is how long it takes for Mikey McCoy to put the phone to his ear. Now why is that precise timing so important? Because there's no dialing. Mikey didn't have time to dial, okay? You can't dial and put your phone to your ear in 0.834 seconds. The next time that you're gonna see Mikey McCoy, as we just showed you, is in just under two and a half seconds on the other side of the tent. He's on a phone call. ^t-00-10-34

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=676" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:16</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-11-16.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** So we can track Mikey, but let's watch the clip again in milliseconds so you really grasp how quickly this transpires. So when this clip was brought... There we go. We're tracking that. Yeah, when the clip was brought to my attention, I obviously have a file—a big folder of files—of every angle, and I decided to track Mikey from every angle available to see like maybe we just missed it and he did at some point put that phone down, dial a number, speed dial, hold down one—I don't know. Maybe we missed it because that seems automatic, right? ^t-00-11-16

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=719" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:11:59</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-11-59.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** 0.834—that seems pretty quick. And no, no, he doesn't do that. We even have him in front of Charlie's car. When Charlie is brought to the car—the waiting car, rather—he is still on the phone. I can show you the clip of that. Take a look at this. Don't worry. We'll slow it down for you. See him in the background with the backpack? It's Mikey McCoy. Okay. So what are we to make of that? The only logical conclusion that I can come up with—and many others, because I've pressed—I said, "Play devil's advocate. I want you to advocate for Mikey McCoy. ^t-00-11-59

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=761" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:12:41</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-12-41.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I want you to play lawyer, and you are representing your client, Mikey McCoy. What was he doing? How did he do it this quickly? No one could do this. The only logical conclusion we come up with was that Mikey was already on a phone call at 12:23 p.m. He was already on a phone call. So I said, "Let's go back a little earlier in the footage and see if we can find when he actually maybe dials onto the phone. Maybe we can see him pick up the phone and begin a call before the shot goes off. And then, after being on that call—if we're following this logic—that would mean he puts his phone down until Charlie gets shot." And we were able to find what we think could be that moment. ^t-00-12-41

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=804" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:13:24</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-13-24.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And I can tell you that it is one minute and 45 seconds approximately before that shot goes off. And we can watch that here. I see Mikey's on his phone here. And you're gonna see he pulls it up, and he starts to cover his ear again. Now, could be unrelated. Again, we're taking a guess here. That's what made the most sense to us because we couldn't justify it in any other way. And I wanna be clear: we're not here to make assumptions, okay? And we wouldn't have to make any assumptions if Turning Point USA could just tell the truth. They could just be open, and they could be honest about everything. ^t-00-13-24

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=842" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:02</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-14-02.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Okay, I obviously went out to both Mikey McCoy and Andrew Colvett for a statement—asked those two questions: "Hey, who were you on the phone with? What's going on here?" No response. Weird. Because if that was me and I saw clips going viral and people were drawing conclusions from that clip—thinking that I was already on the phone, thinking that my reaction was weird—I would instantly hit back. I'd say, "Here's my call log. You wanna know who I was on the phone with? 911, obviously. I was freaking out, freaking out. I called 911. I didn't know what I was doing." Here's my phone. Here's my whole call log for that day. ^t-00-14-02

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=886" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:14:46</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-14-46.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** But this is—I don't know—I guess we live in a world where that doesn't make sense. I would have issued a statement to dispel any rumors, but they have not. Here's what I wanna say. And I honestly—I understand I'm preaching to the choir here. Everything about this is wrong. You know it, and I know it. But I actually know it better than most because I helped to build that organization. And that's why I am almost the perfect person to discern what is normal and what is abnormal in terms of what happened at that college campus event. In fact, when I did my tribute to Charlie—this is unbelievable. ^t-00-14-46

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=922" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:22</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-15-22.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Remember, just after he died, I posted a video to my friend Charlie Kirk, and I shared a clip of him at a college event, and he and I were laughing. And I'm going to show you that clip in a second. And I said, "I don't even know which college this is." And I showed the clip because I didn't know what college it was. And unbelievably, it was UVU. I kid you not. Let's rewatch that clip. ^t-00-15-22

Are you not my friend anymore? Are we not friends? Is that right? It's not going to fly now. It's not going to fly out a sign outside of it being an event that we just did. You're not my friend. ^t-00-15-48

**🎤 SPEAKER_1**

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=956" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:15:56</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-15-56.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** Go figure. It's unbelievable that of all the clips, we picked that, and I had no idea it was UVU. The point is that I hit college campuses with Charlie Kirk for six years. I don't believe that there was a single living, breathing person who has spoken at more college campuses alongside Charlie Kirk than me. So I knew that things were weird when I saw, first and foremost, the camera guy—the one who takes down the camera. Seeing him lingering alongside Charlie at the event flagged me as weird immediately. Okay? That's why I reached out when people saw, "I'm taking down the camera." I said, "What is this? Why are you here? Literally, why are you standing next to... ^t-00-15-56

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=997" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:16:37</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-16-37.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I've never at any college event ever in six years had that man standing next to me at an event. Okay? Sometimes he wasn't even there. Other times, of course, when you are in AV, your job is to be somewhere quiet. Your job is to have on like headphones to make sure the audio is good. Maybe the idea that they're miking—the person running a company is miking you up—is completely absurd. I didn't like it. It felt new to me. And you know what? When I called him, things got pretty weird. He acknowledged that a lot of new stuff was happening on that day. And I inquired to him immediately about the subtle changes that I recognized. ^t-00-16-37

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=1038" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:17:18</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-17-18.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And the thing that struck me as wrong was that he lied to me. I don't know why he was lying to me, but a lot of the things that he said didn't make sense. And I'm gonna speak more thoroughly about what it was that he said because, obviously, I recorded the phone call. I, of course, asked him why he took down the cameras so quickly. I asked him to, first and foremost, simply show me the footage because that's all I wanted to do. I'm thinking again, we're all going to get the band back together and solve this murder. And it got weird. It got really weird. I said, "I just want to see the footage so I can debunk. I know that you don't want to put more footage out there. That's fine. But just show me the footage so I can debunk all these internet conspiracies that you were hiding something." ^t-00-17-18

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=1083" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:03</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-18-03.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** I was not suspicious of Turning Point at all, actually, when I called. And I asked him again, like, "What's the reason? What's the reason for taking down the cameras quickly? Why hasn't the footage been released? Let me see it." And he told me that, A, he had spoken only to Erika and the feds that he had regarding the footage—that is. He specifically told me that—as I said earlier—that he had secured that footage because he wanted to prevent Erika—as I told you—from having to relive that moment. And that made entirely no sense to me. I told you guys because we all can watch Charlie Kirk be murdered over and over and over and over and over again. So how are you sparing any emotions here by taking down the back footage? ^t-00-18-03

**<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5BcKF91iec&t=1128" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">00:18:48</a> <a href="/timestamps/ep-c5BcKF91iec/t-00-18-48.md" title="View details for this timestamp">ℹ️</a> SPEAKER_1:** And then it made even less sense to me and appeared to me as a lie once I saw the footage on FaceTime when I realized that there was no blood on Charlie. So it was the least traumatizing footage of all. Why be so secretive about it? He then told me that he needed to speak with Turning Point lawyers first to see about releasing the footage. I said, "Okay, fine." I let him take a couple of days off, and then we got back on the phone, and I said, "Look, that's kind of a BS excuse too because you run your own company, and the footage is owned by you." He then said, "Okay, yeah, I do own the footage. I just wanted—you know—just coordinate, check, whatever." Okay. Kind of a lie number two-ish. Then he said something that really bothered me. ^t-00-18-48

Like the file was too large." Oh, oh, I was born yesterday. So you run an entire AV company, and you don't know how to send footage? That didn't smell right to me. It got even more bizarre. He told me—and this is when I was extremely uncomfortable. He said, after I offered, "You can just use WeTransfer," "I don't wanna just send the footage over the internet—that's behind Charlie's head—because I'm worried that Google might hack me." I swear on everything I love—that's what he told me. ^t-00-19-32

So at this moment, I got a little bit—I looked at my team, and I started snapping across the table, and I was like—I said to them literally, "Guilty of something. I don't know. This is weird. What a stupid lie." So I said to him, I said, "Let's just pretend that that does happen for whatever reason—Sergey Brin is sitting around, and he's going, 'I want to hack this person because I want to see footage behind Charlie's head.'" Does it? Whatever. And then he gives the footage to... Fox News, CNN, and they play it. And what happens after that? ^t-00-20-16

We all get to see Charlie Kirk die from a different angle. We've seen him die from a thousand different angles. Like, what is actually changing if Google hacks you?" Weird—a weird thing to say. I also asked him who he was on the phone with after Charlie got shot. And he told me—and I kid you not— he was on the phone with the ops that were back in Arizona watching. And I said, "What ops? We don't have people back in Arizona watching when we do college campus events. Is that something new?" He said, "Yes, it is new. In fact, this was the first time we were doing it." He said there were two people—two ops watching it back in Arizona. ^t-00-21-00

He wanted people to live-cut the clips so that they could be the first people to get it on the internet. He didn't want to—he's like, not even a second to be wasted. So live-streaming to everybody can watch, but they were racing some people to get the clips out faster than anybody else because Charlie's ambitious." Now I got a little suspicious, and sensing he could sense that I was now growing increasingly suspicious with every random thing that he was saying, he sent me a video I didn't ask for. I wanted to see the footage. ^t-00-21-44

I don't know if he thought that I thought that he shot Charlie. I certainly did not think that he was involved in pulling a trigger and killing Charlie Kirk. I actually don't know why this video—I don't know what this video could have done that he sent me other than to make me feel even more uncomfortable. Because the video he sent me is quite shocking. It's also the reason that I knew that Tyler Bowyer was lying when he tweeted, "And this guy was commanded by the police to take down the cameras." He's lying because I have every minute of what this guy was doing—thanks to him having sent it to me, okay? ^t-00-22-27

And there are only four minutes, by the way, before he takes those cameras down. So he's next to—and he is in front of—Mikey McCoy when Charlie gets shot. Now to his credit, he actually did see Charlie get shot. He saw—like a split second—sees Charlie bleeding and runs. And doesn't run very far. He just runs a couple of yards away. Now I should mention that the camera guy—he too was also brought into the company by Tyler Bowyer, okay? And if you have worked with Charlie for this long—over a decade— and you watch Charlie Kirk get shot, what do you do? ^t-00-23-12

I'm asking you this question at home. What would you do? I say two things that are pretty commonplace, right? You choose between fight or flight. You run towards him, or you run away—and you run away far—because you don't know what's happening. Is it one shot? Are there multiple people? Are you being pursued? There's no way to process that. If you are going to be in flight, you should be sprinting and maybe calling 911. That's what I would have done if I wanted to run away and not towards Charlie to make sure he's okay. But this second close friend of Charlie chose to run just a few yards away—up to a grassy knoll— to take out his phone. ^t-00-23-56

Taking a quick break to tell you about Riverbend Ranch. You guys know I absolutely love their steaks. They have black Angus beef, which is famous for its great flavor. Riverbend Ranch has taken black Angus beef to a whole different level because over the last 35 years, they've been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness.

Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones or antibiotics. Every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to the Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. When you purchase from Riverbend Ranch, you're not only supporting the 64 cowboys and their families who work on the ranch, but you're also supporting the over 260 other U.S. ranches and the hundreds of American families who work on those ranches. It's born in the USA, raised in the USA, and processed here in the USA. Their meat is aged to perfection for 21 days. And then it's shipped directly from their ranch to your home. This is not your average black Angus beef. This is more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef I've ever tasted. ^t-00-29-10

And then I just waited because we're fishing now. And I knew they would do this. I knew liars have to lie fast and first. And he did. He lied.

Your subconscious picks up on things before your conscious does. Which brings me to dreams, by the way, because before I went on break, many people were triggered because I discussed on a previous show a dream that I had—a very vivid dream—whereupon Charlie told me that he had been betrayed.

We talked about the spiritual realm, we talked about religion, our faith—most importantly, what our life's purpose was. There was this period in April where Charlie kept insisting to me over and over again that he was going to die young. In fact, he told me that Turning Point USA was going to be the death of him. And I'm going to allow you to read his words. And it's funny how this came about because when I was in Wyoming, I went outside. I was writing—like, physically needed to write, to put pen to paper and to pray. And I was sitting in Jackson overlooking the mountains. And right when I concluded my prayer, I opened my eyes, and I saw a massive bald eagle. And it just made me feel at peace. ^t-00-37-26

I'm going to show you some of those messages now—a particular set of messages that were written on April 6th, 2018, just a couple of weeks before Kanye tweeted, "I love the way Candace Owens thinks," which is relevant because a lot of things changed after that tweet.

He had such a political vision for me. I never wanted that sort of a thing. "I see it so freaking clearly. I might be Moses though. I might not see this whole thing through, LMAO. If that is the case, be my David." I said, "Dude, you haven't even realized your power yet." You're so young, is what I was thinking.

Since the beginning of TPUSA, I knew in my gut that I might get wiped out at any time. I cannot explain it, but I dream about it all the time—like, all the time. Anyway, that's depressing convo for another time, LMAO." I said, "That's weird—more of a fear manifestation than premonition." He said, "I'm not really afraid of it, but I'm just telling you what I know to be true." And he told me that. He told me that. I don't know why. Charlie knew he was gonna die young. ^t-00-39-39

I just felt like I needed to share that because it is in part why the moment that Charlie got shot, I just knew he was betrayed spiritually. In the same way that Charlie knew he was going to die young, I knew that this was a part of something bigger. And so I wanted to say to you guys—to the people that betrayed Charlie— I would recommend that you come clean, okay? I would recommend that you come clean because Charlie said some other things, and I look at these things now, and I think, "Wow, it's almost prophetic, right? It's almost prophecy." And I can tell you that this is a story that will have a happy ending—a tragedy that will have a happy ending. ^t-00-40-14

They are. I would recommend that you come clean. There are lines in the sand that are being drawn right now between good and evil. Many of you have picked the evil side. You do, podcasters, people that make videos, people that are taking money—tell people, "Don't look over there." I would recommend you stop doing that. You don't have to listen to me. You probably won't listen to me. And to people that betrayed Charlie—you probably won't come clean, likely because you're scared now. You should be scared, but you're the wrong kind of scared. Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. There is more. This is not it. I'm aware of that. ^t-00-40-59

I've picked my side. I don't care about any of you. I can't wait to read your articles after this. Okay. That's breakfast for me. That inspires me now. Can't wait to read your loony tweets. I can't wait for you to live off things that I've said. I cannot wait because you know what? On a hike that Charlie and I were on in Wyoming one time, we were discussing the death penalty. Like, he was asking—like, "What's your position on the death penalty?" And I told him, I've always been against it. And typically that's a theological conversation. Christians go back and forth on it: Do you have a right to take a life? I'm on the side that no, we don't have a right to take a life. ^t-00-41-43

I said to Charlie, the reason I'm against it is because death is easy. You're here, and then you're not. It's like falling asleep, right? You're here one second, and then you're not. Think about passing out or fainting. People that commit grave evil—and we're giving them death? That's it. Yeah, I always say they deserve more than that.

I'm not going to stop talking about Charlie Kirk's death. In fact, instead of trying to make me shut up, you should do something else. I think your time would be better spent trying to stop the sun from rising. You'd have more success if you spent your time trying to stop the sun from rising than trying to get me to shut up about who killed Charlie Kirk because he knew he was going to die, and he knew that I was going to be the person that had the spine to stand up for him. ^t-00-43-50

And we are going to see this thing out. And like I said, there will be justice—not the fake kind, not the Tyler Bowyer kind—actual justice. We'll take a brief break here, and then we'll get to some of your comments. All right, you guys. Jumping in to tell you about The Wellness Company because it is officially cold and flu season—which means that it's also flu shot season. ^t-00-44-31

Yay. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is quote-unquote "moderately effective" at best—and that's not even accounting for the vaccine injuries. There is a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company. If you wake up with a sore throat or you have a runny nose, you can address those symptoms right away with a doctor-prescribed kit that contains ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, generic Tamiflu, generic Z-Pak—much more. It's like having an urgent care clinic in your home. I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line at an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. ^t-00-45-11

This kit is literally a lifesaver with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So go to twc.health/Candace today and use code Candace at checkout, and you'll save $48. Get it now before cold and flu season kicks into high gear. That's twc.health/Candace. Use code CANDACE, and you'll get $48 off. Kits available to U.S. residents only. Also, I want to remind you guys about American Financing because the cost of everything is still out of control. Many of us are relying on credit cards to cover the essentials. If that debt is piling up for you, you should know that you're obviously not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. ^t-00-45-54

The Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment, giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity that's in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. And it only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing today and start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210.

And, of course, I want to tell you guys about Nimi Skin Care. You know I love them for years. The beauty industry kind of convinced us that we need complex formulas to achieve healthy skin, but the secret to healthy skin is actually a lot simpler. That's why I was very interested when I found Nimi Skin Care. Nimi is doing something radical. They've built one of their most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth, which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is traditional. It's an ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils, which means that your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Nimi has two products from their tallow line that you should definitely know about. ^t-00-47-19

This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling. They've combined that incredible grass-fed tallow with soothing aloe vera—I love aloe vera—and jojoba oil. It's perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind. Then for the problem areas—for the really dry, cracked skin—they have the Buzzy Tallow Balm. It's an ultra-rich balm that uses tallow and beeswax to create a protective barrier. It locks in moisture. It shields your skin from the elements and allows it to heal. This is skin care the way that it was meant to be—which is simple, pure, powerfully effective. It's a focus on skin-loving ingredients made right here in the USA. So go to nimiskincare.com, explore their tallow line, and don't forget to use my code CANDACE10 at checkout, and you'll get 10% off your order. ^t-00-48-03

Well, I'm hearing that Ian Carroll is in the chat. Ian Carroll, thank you. It should not be you and James Lee and Ryan Matta—who I didn't even know before this—who is not letting this go, going day in and day out. You guys didn't even know Charlie Kirk. It shouldn't be you. It shouldn't be you guys. It shouldn't be Zeb Boykin doing ballistics. I'm missing the name. We'll get to that later this week—of the guy who went over the Google searches. It should not be all of these people, but I'm glad it is. The decentralization of it all is actually what makes this so powerful.

It is so amazing to hold this book. Also, I want to tell you—they said, "You know, you're supposed to go out when you do a book and ask people to write something nice about you—like, 'Yeah, this is amazing, and I love her,' da-da-da-da—Ian Carroll or something." And I just thought it would be so much more fun to go on the internet and to look at all the comments that have been said by famous people about me. So we've got Cardi B, who wrote a review. She said, "I honestly feel sorry for you." This is a review of my character over the years. "Candace Owens is a fraud"—from Lance Bass. ^t-00-49-29

I don't even feel like I wear that many skirts, so that's impressive. JoJo Siwa—that's my favorite one. "Candace and I do not F with each other." "I would have you on my show anytime. I always tell you that. And I love that you look like you're a lot happier than you were a few years ago." Ben Shapiro—notoriously on that table—said her faux sophistication has been ridiculous. So I'm keeping it faux sophisticated. And Chrissy Teigen wrote, "Go the F away already, you dumb soulless panderer." ^t-00-50-14

Thank you for all the people that supported this. You guys can go to MakeHimASandwich.com if you would like to support me. And this is an amazing book. I wrote every word of it. It's the first time that we took it out of a publishing house, which feels amazing because I think that's the future as well. Decentralization—publish your own books—because the publishers also have a lot of power in changing history. And so I wanted to say that. Getting into some of your comments here. Ian Carroll wrote, "Right? Fishing takes time. You got to set the bait." It's so good to have you back, Candace. Oh, I spent time setting a lot of bait. A lot of bait has been set, and we'll see what we get. Amanda writes, "This is sick. ^t-00-50-56

You are setting an amazing example for girls in the future. We love you, sister. Christ is King." Thank you so much, Kiki. And I do think women are a big part of this. I think we were kind of—and we get into this in this book—but the feminist movement? To know where that comes from. There's a chapter called "Beyond the Pale"—the Pale of Settlement of Russia who brought over that feminist movement. It is good for you to know where that came from because I think we all were doing feminism. I was when I was younger—like, "I'm a feminist," thinking it was like girl power, Spice Girls—and it was never that. Never ever that.

It was a dark time, but in hindsight, it's clearly what was happening. Amal, it actually—I think it all started with Kanye tweeting me. I think handlers were sent out to manage—to first and foremost break apart me and Charlie and then to manage us. And I'll speak more about that this week, but I spoke to my husband about it, and I see it so clearly now what happened— and those messages between me and Charlie leading up to that week that he tweeted us. It was actually Scott Adams, who did a video that I'll never forget when that happened. And he said like it ripped a hole in the universe—this tweet—and it was never supposed to happen. I'm going to dig that up, find it, and speak more about what my experience was—where I do genuinely believe that handlers were sent out. And I got lucky that I had this overwhelming spiritual feeling that needed to go to the UK, and I met my husband. ^t-00-52-22

Like, I mean, come on. It's like no one buys it at this point. But don't worry. I'm sure no one at Turning Point will think that's weird. They're just like, "It's open. It's closed.

In a world where money and greed are taking over people's lives, thank you for helping us to stay grounded in God's truth. Yes. It is worth losing money—as I did. It is worth losing fake friends—as I did—to stand up for the truth. And I'm just ready for war with these people. Like, all of it—band together, you know? Send your best warriors because all they ever do is lie and smear and delude and take away and deplatform—and you're not winning anymore. And something that I want to say that's also so amazing is I didn't have to fight hard this time for people to believe me. And I don't know.

I feel now—as I was reflecting on things—that they all were trying to bottle up Charlie's energy, and Charlie sent his energy where it needed to be. I barely defended myself as they came out—attacked, lied: "She didn't even speak to him since 2017. She didn't know Charlie. She hasn't seen him." They just lied and lied and lied and lied.

The amount of money that was spent on telling those lies—and I barely had to defend myself—and you guys knew that I was telling the truth. And I think that that's incredible—that it truly is a testament to God and is a testament to truth. And as Ian Carroll said when I had him on my show, the truth doesn't need to be repeated over and over again. It's the power of the frequency of truth, right? It takes a lot of little lies. It's why the lie demands the truth shuts up. It's the reason they pass speech laws. They need people to be quiet because when you start speaking the truth, it becomes more powerful. I truly believe that, and I'm calling upon everyone to do that more often: like, just speak the truth even if you're fearful of the consequence because the bigger consequence is not being right with God when you pass. ^t-00-55-08

He was saying this when he was in his 20s, and he was 41." Yeah. Charlie said a lot more. He said a lot more, and I'm gonna keep it close because I do think a part of it was prophecy. Now I really do believe that, and I'm gonna see this thing to the end.

In your situation, you either run far, and you don't record yourself, right? Or you go run towards your friend, and you help. In fact, the only person—as Ian Carroll pointed out in one of his videos, and you should subscribe to Ian Carroll's channel— as well. He pointed out that like the only person who was acting right was Frank Turek. Like, the first thing you do is get down, right? Because you don't know if there's going to be another shot. How was Mikey McCoy confident enough to stay standing and walking? Nobody knows. You don't know where the shot's coming from. You don't see him get shot.

Look: Charlie didn't know—no, but he knew—that he was gonna die young from the moment that he started Turning Point, as he said. But he knew. And he was right. So go with your gut. Believe in your dreams, right? And when people try to mock you and tell you not to listen to them—not to trust your gut—know that those people are working for the devil, literally, okay? They want you to think that this life is it, and this life is not it. So get right with God and tell the truth, and we'll see you guys tomorrow. ^t-00-58-01
