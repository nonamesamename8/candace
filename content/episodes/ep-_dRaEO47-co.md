I guess we could say <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> broke the Internet one more time. One hundred and fifty thousand of you guys were watching, and the system just sort of crashed. And it makes me—it just really makes me happy that that happened, actually. It was already very difficult for me to do this for a lot of reasons. But I knew it was important, because I didn't want the last thing that people had in their minds about <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> to be the moment he lost his life. That was what was especially hard, because he's just had so many amazing moments throughout his career. ^t-00-00-01

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-00-37.md" class="timestamp-link">00:00:37</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=37" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And as I was saying, I was having this discussion with <span id="ent-person-george-farmer-t-00-00-37"><a href="/entities/person-george-farmer.md">George</a></span> this morning, obviously through a lot of tears, about not wanting <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-37"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">s</a></span> caricature to survive when the actual <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a>—the individual who <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> actually is—is so much more important. The caricature of the cartoon is that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> is this young, smart guy, made a career out of debating college kids, decided not to go to college, started <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-00-37"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. And I think a lot of people thought that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> must take himself a bit too seriously. And I want you guys to know that that could not be further from the truth. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and me were always laughing. Yes, he was ambitious. Everybody knows <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s ambitious. ^t-00-00-37

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-01-20.md" class="timestamp-link">00:01:20</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=80" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I met him back in <span id="ent-date-2017-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/date-2017.md">2017</a></span>, when <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a></span> was this very young organization. Nobody knew who I was. Nobody knew who <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> was. And <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was always wearing these really baggy suits. I mean, they looked like they were hand-me-downs from three generations, because he was focused on the ideas. He didn't care about his appearance. He was laser-focused on what he knew <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> could become—not could become, but would become. He hired me on the spot. We were at this conference in <span id="ent-gpe-florida-t-00-01-20"><a href="/entities/gpe-florida.md">Florida</a></span>. And he and I used to always say—we never said, “The rest was history.” “The rest is history.” We’d say, “The rest is future.” We were totally locked in. And I want you guys to know about our first planning sesh, okay? ^t-00-01-20

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-02-03.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:03</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=123" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** It was in the middle of <span id="ent-gpe-chicago-t-00-02-03"><a href="/entities/gpe-chicago.md">Chicago</a></span> O'Hare airport. There is this restaurant that's called the Macaroni Grill. And I sat down with <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-03"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> on our first trip together. He flips over this little paper menu as we're waiting for our flight, and he takes out this pen, and he just starts drawing a map of what he wants to happen into the future, what the <a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point</a> organization will become. It was spastic. It was unhinged. It was the absolute best. It was true <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. He was a visionary. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was a visionary. If he could envision it, it was going to happen. He knew that. I knew that. And what he had envisioned was for <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-02-03"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span> to become the biggest conservative student organization—not just in the nation, by the way, but in the world. ^t-00-02-03

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-02-47.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:47</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=167" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** He kind of scrawled and scribbled, and wrote that his structure is currently a 501(c)(3), and he's sitting there talking to me: “But here's what we can do in the future, and here's how, and then I'm going to probably take control of the RNC.” I mean, he's 23 years old, right? And he's talking, speaking to me about how he's going to... take over the RNC. The person that he adored the most—like, really, never in a million years did he think that he was going to meet him, and of course he did—was Rush <span id="ent-person-rush-limbaugh-t-00-02-47"><a href="/entities/person-rush-limbaugh.md">Limbaugh</a></span>. He was really raised on Rush <a href="/entities/person-rush-limbaugh.md">Limbaugh</a>, listening to Rush <a href="/entities/person-rush-limbaugh.md">Limbaugh</a> day in and day out, and he told me through many conversations that if he could have a show like Rush <a href="/entities/person-rush-limbaugh.md">Limbaugh</a> one day, he would be very happy. That was, I think, his ultimate goal, and it happened. We had a bunch of rules. ^t-00-02-47

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-03-31.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:31</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=211" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-31"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s rule was never say no to <span id="ent-org-fox-news-t-00-03-31"><a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a></span>. So even if the show was at 4 a.m. in the morning, crack of dawn, I cannot tell you guys how many hits we did on <a href="/entities/org-fox-news.md">Fox News</a>. I'm talking four hits a day, up at 4 a.m. for Fox & Friends First and then doing whatever the evening program was, because he believed this is the way that we're going to get our names out there. You know, we have to work harder. My rule was like, we shouldn't drink. Everybody in politics is drinking. They're drunk all the time. If we're passionate, we have to understand that it's a disadvantage. People are always made weaker. It doesn't make anybody stronger to be drunk after an event. And so we didn't drink. And we had a motto, a couple of mottos, but <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s was, “We can always outwork our opponents.” ^t-00-03-31

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-04-16.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:16</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=256" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I can't tell you how many times we looked at each other and we said, “We can outwork them.” Everyone was bigger than us, but not working harder than us. That came really directly from <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. It was the thing that he said we could always control. And I totally agreed with that. Work ethic meant everything. I think it's very obvious to everyone. I was the culture. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was the politics. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> needed a little bit more culture. I needed to learn the rules of politics. I mean, he could tell you every office in the <span id="ent-org-white-house-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/org-white-house.md">White House</a></span> and what this person does, things I'd never even heard before. I was just passionate about <span id="ent-org-black-lives-matter-t-00-04-16"><a href="/entities/org-black-lives-matter.md">Black Lives Matter</a></span>. I knew it was going to be harmful for Black Americans, and I wanted to share that message. ^t-00-04-16

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-04-56.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:56</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=296" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> showed me how to do that in the best way possible. I learned very quickly with <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> that politics breeds unnecessary enemies. It's a disheartening industry. You're lucky if you have one friend. You're lucky if you have two friends. There are so many people that will test your character along the way. Like I said, I was a nobody. It was funny, going through text messages yesterday, and I'm like, “<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, my goal is to have 50,000 followers on <span id="ent-org-instagram-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/org-instagram.md">Instagram</a></span>. I think we can do it by the end of the year.” And after he hired me, he had been working already really hard on doing this campus tour throughout <span id="ent-gpe-california-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/gpe-california.md">California</a></span>. He called it the Big Three: <span id="ent-org-ucla-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/org-ucla.md">UCLA</a></span>, we're going to do <span id="ent-org-stanford-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/org-stanford.md">Stanford</a></span>, we're going to do <span id="ent-org-berkeley-t-00-04-56"><a href="/entities/org-berkeley.md">Berkeley</a></span>. ^t-00-04-56

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-05-39.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:39</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=339" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And there was somebody who was a lot bigger than me at the time, who was going to be kind of the face of it. Because like I said, people were not going to buy tickets to hear me and <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie Kirk</a> speak. And he had someone that they definitely would hear speak. And for whatever reason—and this was just my luck—<span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-39"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was pumping gas. He was inside of the gas station. And I'm sitting in the car, and I see this person. His phone is sitting in the car, and the messages are lighting up on the screen and this individual is saying, “I don't want to do this event with that new girl you hired. Like, I don't want to share the stage with her, essentially. I mean, just mean-spirited, no reason. I'm bigger than her. I should do this by myself. And then if she wants to come on and be an auxiliary, that's fine. I don't want to share the stage with her, this newbie.” ^t-00-05-39

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-06-24.md" class="timestamp-link">00:06:24</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=384" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** I remember <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-24"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> gets in the car, and he looks at the message, and he looks at me, and he knows I've looked at the message. I saw him. Like, “<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>,” I said, “I have no idea—like—where this is going. Obviously, I understand the sensible you doesn't want to lose this person on the ticket, that this means a lot to you and you've worked hard on it, but you're going to have to learn that you have to make the right decision and not the easy decision. And this is only going to work if we keep making the right decisions, you know?” And I could just see the struggle within him. And then he just—he did the right thing. He said, “Okay, if they don't want to do this event with this newbie, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-06-24"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, then we're not going to do the event. And <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> and I will do it alone.” And we did. ^t-00-06-24

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-07-08.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:08</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=428" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** We went—we went at it alone. Actually, I think for that particular event, Dave <span id="ent-person-dave-rubin-t-00-07-08"><a href="/entities/person-dave-rubin.md">Rubin</a></span> hopped on, and the rest was future. For two years straight, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-08"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and I flew around the world together. On very little sleep, we were always exhausted. I'm not kidding. We took hundreds of flights together. We slept in the crappiest hotel rooms. I mean, walls so paper thin you just hear everything. And when you're in that capacity with someone, two years straight, just traveling nonstop, you really get to know them. You really see them in every condition. You start bickering like an old married couple. “<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, this is not how you pack a suitcase,” I’d say to him. “You can't just put your dirty running shoes on top of your clean shirts, okay? You just can't do that. ^t-00-07-08

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-07-52.md" class="timestamp-link">00:07:52</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=472" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-07-52"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, you need to eat something, okay? You're running on fumes; you got to eat something. This is not a full meal.” Back, forth. “<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, you got to buy yourself some suits that fit.” That conversation—I was like, “<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, okay, I get it. You're like boy wonder; you got to buy some suits that fit.” I wasn't the only one that was hammering him on that. It was also Don Jr. (<span id="ent-person-donald-trump-t-00-07-52"><a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Donald Trump</a></span> Jr.) and eventually him. And I think it was actually him and <span id="ent-person-eric-trump-t-00-07-52"><a href="/entities/person-eric-trump.md">Eric</a></span>. They were like, “You know, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, I know you're very frugal. We know that you're very aware that your salary comes from donors.” He always wanted to be a really good steward of their capital. But eventually, <span id="ent-person-donald-trump-jr-t-00-07-52"><a href="/entities/person-donald-trump-jr.md">Don</a></span> and <a href="/entities/person-eric-trump.md">Eric</a> got him a gift certificate—I think it was for his birthday—to a fancy suit place to go get fitted. And the rest is future, right? ^t-00-07-52

He did not take himself too seriously. He was so good at doing imitations and accents. Anybody, any imitation, any accent, he was just on the money. And all we did was laugh. It's all you can do—and laugh. People were just so crazy all the time. I was reading through the chat today. I was just laughing with just tears in my eyes, thinking of the many road trips that we took, so many hours spent just talking trash to one another, making fun of one another. ^t-00-08-35

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-09-13.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:13</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=553" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** One of the best moments that I can think of, and there are so many to choose from, was we were driving through <span id="ent-gpe-colorado-t-00-09-13"><a href="/entities/gpe-colorado.md">Colorado</a></span>, and I put on a <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a> song, you know, on my playlist, and <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-13"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> goes, “Is this <a href="/entities/person-jay-z.md">Jay-Z</a>?” I almost made him pull over the vehicle. I was like, “Are you kidding me? Okay, I understand that you don't do culture, but like, come on, you don't know the difference between Jay-<span id="ent-person-jay-z-t-00-09-13"><a href="/entities/person-jay-z.md">Z</a></span> and <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-09-13"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span>?" And he didn't, and I explained to him the difference. I was like, “Okay, you got to get into some <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a> music.” Next thing you know, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s really getting into some <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a> music. He's running 10 miles a day. He got really into running, and he's texting me about how great it is. Like, there's this text, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, he's like, “Yes, it's my new favorite song.” ^t-00-09-13

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-09-57.md" class="timestamp-link">00:09:57</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=597" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** And he just loved it. <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a>'<span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-09-57"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">s</a></span> "Power" kind of became our theme song for the tour. I have no idea why, but that was our hype song before we went on stage. So you can only imagine when just a couple of months later, we've been listening to <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a>'s old albums on repeat, suddenly <a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye West</a> tweets, “I love the way <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-09-57"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> thinks.” The excitement, okay?<span id="event-event-2018-04-21-kanye-west-tweets-i-love-the-way-candace-t-00-09-57"><a href="/events/event-2018-04-21-kanye-west-tweets-i-love-the-way-candace.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> We were certain that we had manifested it. 100% we manifested this by listening to “Power” on repeat. Actually, I found a clip of us backstage on that day when that tweet happened, and we were doing what I used to refer to as like the <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-09-57"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> dance. Here it is. [Following clip attributed to Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk.] ^t-00-09-57

The era of <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-10-41"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span>. I can't even explain it, because you really did have to be there. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was my overly bright and sometimes really annoying kid brother. I was smiling going through my chats of how many times he would text me a picture and say, “Does this look cool? Does this look cool? Do I look cool?” This is, like, just a screen recording of us talking about a pair of sunglasses. He's just sending me it. I'm like, “Nah, that's not good. Nope, that's not. No, no. Send... OK, that one's OK. That'll work.” And this is actually one of my favorite photos of him, ^t-00-10-41

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-_dRaEO47-co/t-00-11-27.md" class="timestamp-link">00:11:27</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dRaEO47-co&t=687" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** where I could just hear him when I look at this photo. I can hear him saying, “Does this look cool?” He was wearing a pair of Yeezys that <span id="ent-person-kanye-west-t-00-11-27"><a href="/entities/person-kanye-west.md">Kanye</a></span> gave him, and he looked really cool. I thought they really suited him. I was like, “Yeah, you look really cool, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-11-27"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>.” Um, the reverse of that, obviously, was him constantly hammering me on debates. I mean, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was like, “Look, you gotta—you gotta know the arguments of your opponents backward and forward.” I remember I had note cards, like I was in high school, just memorizing every statistic and being strengthened by, you know, just day in and day out. He was just pretending to be a protester, pretending to be a radical. And he used to always say, “Iron sharpens iron.” ^t-00-11-27

He wouldn't do that. He took that very seriously. It doesn't matter what the circumstance was—even if it was a hurricane. And one day there was literally a hurricane. I think we were in <span id="ent-gpe-north-carolina-t-00-12-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-north-carolina.md">North Carolina</a></span>, <span id="ent-gpe-south-carolina-t-00-12-10"><a href="/entities/gpe-south-carolina.md">South Carolina</a></span> at the time. I don't remember, but all the flights got canceled, and we needed to be in D.C. by morning. And <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> looks at me, he's like, “We got to rent a car. We got to drive eight hours.” Totally insane. And one of the most fun road trips I've had in my life. Every single song was sung. ^t-00-12-10

To show you, this is from that road trip. And then, of course, there was always some hip hop mixed in—“Ignition (Remix).” “And we can...

We just loved the t-shirts. That was the thing. The “Him Too” one, that was controversial. That was a controversial moment, one of those character-forming moments. I won't forget it. Because that <span id="ent-concept-me-too-t-00-13-27"><a href="/entities/concept-me-too.md">Me Too</a></span> hashtag, it had just started going viral and people were emotional, and right away I was like, “<a href="/entities/concept-me-too.md">Me Too</a> is awful. This is terrible for women, it's terrible for men.” You know, just me being <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-13-27"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>, saying the thing and...

And then we had at the same time the <span id="ent-org-ywls-t-00-14-11"><a href="/entities/org-ywls.md">YWLS</a></span> conference. So the reporters, who already hated us, just completely—they just swooped in there, and they were like, “Oh, do you support her statements?” And I just remember just being behind <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-14-11"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and <span id="ent-person-andrew-kolvet-t-00-14-11"><a href="/entities/person-andrew-kolvet.md">Andrew Kolvet</a></span>. And he just held the line. He held the line because he agreed with me, and he knew it was going to be a bit of fire. People: “You've got to fire her. How could she say this?” And he didn't. He held the line. And, yeah, it just—it was one of those moments where <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>—he had good character. ^t-00-14-11

That was <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, man. That was always his main thing. Be a happy warrior. And he was a happy warrior. And we were happy warriors. And we laughed a lot at the protesters, the absurdity of the protesters, always. I personally think some of the protesters liked that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and I were making light fun of them.

It really is incredible to see how many times he's just right behind my back. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> always had my back, and I always had his. <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was right by my side when I started <span id="ent-org-blexit-t-00-16-36"><a href="/entities/org-blexit.md">Blexit</a></span>, obviously.

I got to tell you, initially <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-17-19"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>, ever the analytical mind, when I told him, I'm like, “I think I'm going to marry this guy,” first, he's like, “Wait, wait, wait, like, is this going to be good for your brand?” “But <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, this is love. This is not a brand decision.” And then he sat down and he spent just one evening with <span id="ent-person-george-farmer-t-00-17-19"><a href="/entities/person-george-farmer.md">George</a></span>, and he—<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>—was just the most supportive of everything. And this is our text chain—speaking about that moment. He's like, “His heart is wonderful. You guys are meant for each other. I see it brilliantly and clearly. And he gets it. He isn't afraid of you being you. And he's been through hell.” And it was—yeah, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was by my side the day that I got married, of course. ^t-00-17-19

And of course, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-18-02"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> fell in love with <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a>. That entire journey, to me, when I was reading through our texts, is so funny because it was exceptional. I was always leaning into <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>'s analytical mind and making fun of him. Like, “Oh, all we need to do is get a plan. You love <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-18-02"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span>? Okay, what's the plan? What are we going to do? What's step one? What's step two?” And the plan that I came up with instantly was, all we have to do is convince her that her last name is terrible. Her last name. Oh, she's got to marry you, because it's practical. Kirk is going to... Mrs. <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Kirk</a> sounds so much better than Mrs. <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a> <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Frantzve</a>. What is that last name? It's a practical decision. This is the text chain from that: “<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika Kirk</a>.” He says, “It's going to be the power couple of the century. ^t-00-18-02

She literally needs you to propose. It's way too complicated.” He said, “I'm going to tell her it sounds like a sneeze. It's horrible.” And then I wrote, “Marry me. It's a logistics thing.” That's just who we were. Always making fun and always wanting to know what the plan was. And obviously it worked, you guys. It worked. Our plan worked. We broke <span id="ent-person-erika-kirk-t-00-18-47"><a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a></span> down. First came the name shame, then came the wedding, and then came the children. You know, <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-18-47"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> really loved—really, really loved <a href="/entities/person-erika-kirk.md">Erika</a>. From the time—I'm reading through the texts today— just loved her. He loved his family. He really did. And I just want to say that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and I—because I think this is important—never for a single minute ever did <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> and I stop being friends. ^t-00-18-47

Brother and sister, you know—we were fortified. Our relationship was forged in fire, the fire of politics. I knew him.

And people know—like a lot of people in politics—like a lot of people calling me and doing the political dance. Of course, people guessed it correctly when they said, "Oh, the person who probably was the intermediary when <span id="ent-person-donald-trump-t-00-19-31"><a href="/entities/person-donald-trump.md">Trump</a></span> called about <span id="ent-person-brigitte-gabriel-t-00-19-31"><a href="/entities/person-brigitte-gabriel.md">Brigitte</a></span> was <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Kirk</a>." Of course it was <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. They would never send anybody else to call me with anything, because they knew that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was a brother to me. ^t-00-19-31

Nope. Never. Not for a second. I said, it's the easiest decision ever, because <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> knew who I was, and I knew who he was. I said, “<a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, this is where I'm at, and there's no room for movement. And you tell whoever that needs to hear it whatever you need to tell them, because we're always going to be brothers and sisters. We're always going to be brother and sister.” And we would talk about things and debate things behind the scenes. ^t-00-20-12

I'm only a few years older than you, but I think you're going... you're going to see things my way.” And I think, in the end, <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> was going through a spiritual transformation. I don't think it; I know it. He was going through a lot, and there was a lot of pressure. And it's hard for me to watch the people who were pressuring him. I don't know, just say the things that they're saying, you know. I just—there's something about it that just feels really fake, feels really fake to me. ^t-00-20-54

And then to see them doing what they're doing today, it's hurtful to me. It's very hurtful to me. But I don't want today to be about anything other than you guys knowing that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-21-35"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> really was an amazing person. You know, he was like... we were really close, and he was—he was my best friend and my brother, and I will never unsee the footage of what I saw, the violence of it.

And least of all someone with a heart like <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-22-18"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s. He loved his family, he loved his wife, he loved his country. He didn't deserve that ending. You know, he was really young. But I know that we will carry the torch. I will never allow the memory of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> to be forgotten, obviously, because there is no <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-22-18"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> without <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>.
