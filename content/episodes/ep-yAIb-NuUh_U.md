Happy Thursday. Now somebody sent me this throwback clip from <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> and me back when I had a show on <span id="ent-org-prageru-t-00-00-01"><a href="/entities/org-prageru.md">PragerU</a></span>. We were discussing the kind of allies that you need when bullets are flying at you. Take a listen.<span id="event-event-2025-11-13-allie-stuckey-releases-video-mocking-candace-owens-t-00-00-01"><a href="/events/event-2025-11-13-allie-stuckey-releases-video-mocking-candace-owens.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-00-01

You want someone just to say where the bullets are coming from. You don't want someone in the foxhole with you being like, "Well, I want to get a hot dog, maybe a burger or a smoothie." You want someone to say, "No, no, no. There's a machine gun nest over there." There's mortar shells coming from there. Here's what we're going to do to be able to do that. Here's a plan of action to get out of this. ^t-00-00-16

And that's the type of friend that you want. And you definitely don't want one that's going to run for the hills behind you. We've had those. We definitely know who our allies are. I am resisting making a comment about <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-00-37"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span>, but ladies and gentlemen, we are definitively in the foxhole right now. And we are learning who <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-00-37"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>'s real allies are and who his real allies were. So welcome back to <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-00-37"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span>.

I just wanna know who were his actual friends and his allies because somehow too many of them are trying to criminalize asking any questions. Don't just ask questions; just accept the fed slop. It seems a little bit ridiculous. We should start, by the way, with <span id="ent-person-frank-turek-t-00-01-23"><a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank Turek</a></span>. <a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank Turek</a>, as a reminder, he is the pastor friend who was next to <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-01-23"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>. Actually, when he was assassinated, you remember, he was wearing the white hat. He ducks down. He is one of the people that helped to get <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> to the vehicle. He was at the hospital. Well, I just learned that <a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank Turek</a> was reacting to me. He went on <span id="ent-org-cbn-news-t-00-01-23"><a href="/entities/org-cbn-news.md">CBN News</a></span> recently, and here is what he had to say.

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-yAIb-NuUh_U/t-00-02-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:02:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAIb-NuUh_U&t=126" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Frank Turek:** I have not followed <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-02-06"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> closely. I know she was a good friend of <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-02-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> years ago. In fact, when I first met <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, I said, "You know, tell me a little about your ministry, you know, like what you do." And, you know, who have you mentored? He mentioned <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a>. And <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> would never speak ill of anybody privately unless he spoke to that person first and tried to correct them. So <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> never said anything bad about <a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a> or anything, but I just find this idea that she's making all these suggestions without evidence very painful for people. ^t-00-02-06

I had a dream that <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> told me this. That's not evidence. I mean, maybe she's right. It could be. Anything's possible, but not everything has evidence behind it, and what people don't seem to understand is why I had my friend Detective <span id="ent-person-j-warner-wallace-t-00-02-46"><a href="/entities/person-j-warner-wallace.md">J.

**🎤 Candace Owens**

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-yAIb-NuUh_U/t-00-03-41.md" class="timestamp-link">00:03:41</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAIb-NuUh_U&t=221" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** Okay, so a couple of things I want to say here. First and foremost, I am loving this repeat talking point of people who claim that they didn't watch all the episodes, they don't have time to watch the episodes, they don't have time to go through the facts—and yet for some reason know that I said that I had a dream that <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was betrayed, right? That's how you know that you are in the midst of a propaganda spell—that they have been delivered talking points. And it's such a minute point in all of the evidence I presented. I have done second-by-second timelines. I have done minute-by-minute timelines. I have presented webs of people and their connections. I presented a list of how many times he replied to <span id="ent-org-turning-point-usa-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/org-turning-point-usa.md">Turning Point USA</a></span>. They don't know any of that. What they know is that on one episode, <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-03-41"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> said that she had a dream, right? ^t-00-03-41

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-yAIb-NuUh_U/t-00-04-24.md" class="timestamp-link">00:04:24</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAIb-NuUh_U&t=264" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** <span id="ent-person-allie-beth-stuckey-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/person-allie-beth-stuckey.md">Allie</a></span> Stuckey just did this—shot a video and was like, "I don't have these dreams." The idea here is this must just all be crazy rantings every day. <span id="ent-person-candace-owens-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/person-candace-owens.md">Candace</a></span> is up on this show like Ms. Cleo from the '90s and just predicting what she thinks happened. It's such a ridiculous way to try to delegitimize the research that we have done. Now, again, I don't know how you're able to comment if you have not watched what I said, but we are only interested in getting to the truth. So here's what I did. I personally invited <span id="ent-person-frank-turek-t-00-04-24"><a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank Turek</a></span> onto the show because we legitimately want answers. Now, to his second point that he is making there, where he is trying to now say, "This is not how court cases work." We're not looking to have a conversation with the prosecution. ^t-00-04-24

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-yAIb-NuUh_U/t-00-05-06.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:06</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAIb-NuUh_U&t=306" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** We've already decided that this entire investigation feels like a bad Fed operation. We are looking for answers from his friends. You guys can serve the public interest here. We should not pretend like somehow the case would be put at risk if <span id="ent-person-mikey-mccoy-t-00-05-06"><a href="/entities/person-mikey-mccoy.md">Mikey McCoy</a></span> shared his call logs. How's that gonna impact the case? How is that? If you answered questions about why <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-05-06"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> wanted to put together the <span id="ent-concept-doge-t-00-05-06"><a href="/entities/concept-doge.md">DOGE</a></span> Committee, how would that impact the case? We actually... don't really care about the case because we're not feeling like <span id="ent-person-tyler-robinson-t-00-05-06"><a href="/entities/person-tyler-robinson.md">Tyler Robinson</a></span> acted alone and he's the lone shooter.<span id="event-event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve-t-00-05-06"><a href="/events/event-2025-09-10-charlie-kirk-shot-in-neck-at-turning-point-usa-eve.md" class="event-indicator" title="Timeline event">📅</a></span> ^t-00-05-06

**<a href="/timestamps/ep-yAIb-NuUh_U/t-00-05-45.md" class="timestamp-link">00:05:45</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAIb-NuUh_U&t=345" target="_blank" title="Watch on YouTube at this timestamp">▶️</a> Candace Owens:** But we deeply care about whether or not—and why—his friends seem to have been lying to the public. Like we have found these lies. You can't undo that. And you guys refusing to respond to that. We care about whether or not his friends betrayed him, okay? So dreams can give you some sort of intuition. And I certainly think that mine gave me a lot of intuition. But now we have the facts to back that up—at least the claim that they're betraying him now, right? By not answering very simple questions and by lying to the public. So I would very much invite <span id="ent-person-frank-turek-t-00-05-45"><a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank Turek</a></span> onto the show. I don't think we've ever covered <a href="/entities/person-frank-turek.md">Frank Turek</a>. He hasn't really come up in this investigation. He hasn't been caught in any lies, certainly. So I don't know why he would have an issue with coming onto the show to explain how prosecutions work. ^t-00-05-45

We knew—the public—we all knew who <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-06-31"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span> was as a human being, okay? <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a> has been assassinated. And what we are doing now is we are rejecting this idea that everyone who hit the stage at his memorial event can somehow now just be grandfathered into this organization, grandfathered into our acceptance. These individuals should no longer be questioned. They are friends of <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>. That's emotional manipulation. They say they loved <a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a>, and so we should just trust the science and ignore the many lies that they have told us. ^t-00-06-31

How he did this was he pretended that his cat was lost. I'm gonna read you an email that I received from one of his victims who is now an adult, but she was just an eight-year-old child back in <span id="ent-date-1995-t-00-07-47"><a href="/entities/date-1995.md">1995</a></span>.

After I got involved in this whole thing, we didn't know this was part of the thing. They just spring this in trial. And it's this interview where the kid doesn't care what she's saying.

Eventually, they get her to say that there was some inappropriate touching on that. She sort of says it, denies it, but it's all they needed. Now they can go out and arrest somebody. And they obviously don't care who they arrest. And the cops had lined up like 16 different guys of a certain look or whatever. And some of us—I was one of them—were under surveillance. And so they had pictures of us. And they got enough people to say, "That looks like the guy." So they went and got me. Then they come over to my place with a search—they bring me in the search warrant over to my place—and they have 17 specific items that they're looking for.

Is there a financial incentive? Yes, this is an $80 million company. Did people close to him—do you have friends that were jealous? Was he in any fights? This is such a normal quest. It is completely normal. If anybody watches ID TV, it's like, come on—what are we talking about, right? This is such a normal thing to consider.

You've heard me speak a lot about Nimi Skincare. You know I love them. I love their three-step anti-aging routine. It's done wonders for my face, which is why I am so excited that Nimi Skincare now has a complete body line as well. Their Foundations Body Bundle. It's a simple three-step routine. You get the Botanical Bliss body wash to gently cleanse with soothing botanicals, the revitalizing sugar scrub to exfoliate and to hydrate with vitamin C plus coconut oil, and the restorative body lotion to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy. And just like their facial skincare, the Nimi body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients. And best of all, it's made right here in the <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-50-04"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">USA</a></span> by a company that is built on our values: faith, family, and freedom. ^t-00-50-04

Also, remind you guys about Seven Weeks Coffee because if you've been a listener of this show, you know that Seven Weeks Coffee is not just a sponsor for us; it's also a part of our daily routine. We drink it every morning, and honestly, I cannot imagine starting the day without it. But it's not just about the taste. This coffee actually stands for something that we deeply believe in. Seven Weeks Coffee is <span id="ent-gpe-united-states-t-00-50-46"><a href="/entities/gpe-united-states.md">America</a></span>'s pro-life coffee company that's on a mission to fund the pro-life movement, one cup of coffee at a time. ^t-00-50-46

That's the same time a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. They built their business around saving lives by donating 10% of every sale to pregnancy care centers around the world and pro-life organizations nationwide. They've now raised over $1 million and saved thousands of lives. And I can tell you that the coffee is fantastic. It's mold-free, pesticide-free, shade-grown, and low acid.

Tara Observer writes: "The question is, why are so many Jewish donors interested in funding a Christian organization?" Oh, yeah—kind of a good question. That's like a very relevant question. Why millions of dollars from just one person, <span id="ent-person-bob-shorman-t-00-52-52"><a href="/entities/person-bob-shorman.md">Bob Shorman</a></span>? Why are you so interested in funding?

And I do want to put it on like a T-shirt. But then they're going to say like, "Oh, she's trying to grift off of his death," even though everyone else sold T-shirts. And so I feel like I shouldn't do that, but I do love it. It's just so <span id="ent-person-charlie-kirk-t-00-54-14"><a href="/entities/person-charlie-kirk.md">Charlie</a></span>.

We just couldn't hear him or appreciate it because his style—if he communicates it musically, most people understand it. But if he communicates it just on a hot mic, it never comes across, I think, the way that he intends it.

They're kind of like hitting each other like as if they're trying to coordinate. I mean, me and Mark looked at it very slow because I thought I saw the same thing. And then when we watched it from different angles, they don't actually do that. What's compelling is when you can't see them—when they're on the ground. It's just not clear to me what they are doing there. And of course, we know they then put down pavers almost immediately and releveled that area. So I do find that to be quite shady.
