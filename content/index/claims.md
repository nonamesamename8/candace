Multiple news outlets reported on these confirmed messages, including Kirk writing 'Just lost another huge Jewish donor.  million a year because we won't cancel Tucker.' At least one recipient (Josh Hammer) confirmed being on the text thread.

**Source:** [Charlie Kirk lost donors over support for Tucker Carlson | The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-869781)
**Verification Notes:** The Jerusalem Post article reports on leaked messages from Candace Owens showing Charlie Kirk criticizing donors after losing a $2 million donation, directly supporting the claim's core elements. Additional web sources, including a Pravda EN article quoting Tucker Carlson, confirm the specific detail of the loss occurring two days before Kirk's death due to the pledge to feature Carlson at the Turning Point conference. Social media posts on X further corroborate this with references to a specific donor (Robert J. Shillman) withdrawing a $2 million pledge, though these are secondary and based on the same leaks and statements. No contradicting evidence was found in reliable sources.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** Official law enforcement sources (Governor Cox, FBI Director Kash Patel) stated Robinson 'acted alone' in the shooting. The previous verdict incorrectly conflated 'acting alone' with 'living alone.' Lance Twiggs was Robinson's roommate/partner who cooperated with FBI and provided evidence (notes, texts) but was NOT an accomplice in the shooting itself. Twiggs was never charged. The claim 'he acted alone and there was nobody else there' accurately reflects the official position on the shooting.

**Source:** [Charlie Ripped A Hole In Reality | Candace Ep 253 @ 00:00:07](/episodes/ep-Cq7nj9rxPdo.md#t-00-00-07)
**Veracity:** True (medium)
**Verification Notes:** TPUSA spokesman Andrew Kolvet did issue a statement explaining Mikey McCoy's actions after the shooting. According to multiple news sources, Kolvet stated: 'Charlie had given me similar instructions, if anything ever happens to me you call Erika, and he drilled that into Mikey's brain so that when this moment of trauma happened, that he turned around and he knew he had to do it.' This confirms TPUSA made this claim about Charlie instructing Mikey beforehand. However, we cannot independently verify whether Charlie actually gave these instructions - we can only verify that TPUSA made this statement, which is what the claim asserts.

**Source:** [Top pro-Israel TPUSA donor terminated support for Kirk in days before death, sources say - The Grayzone](https://thegrayzone.com/2025/09/22/israel-tpusa-donor-terminated-kirk/)
**Verification Notes:** The article reports that ultra-Zionist billionaire Robert Shillman (likely a reference to 'Bob Shulman,' possibly a misspelling) ended funding for Turning Point USA due to Charlie Kirk's increasingly critical views on Israel. Additional posts found on X and other web sources, including leaks from group chat messages shared by Candace Owens, specify that Shillman withdrew a $2 million pledge specifically because Kirk refused to cancel Tucker Carlson from appearing at events. This aligns with the claim's details, though the exact name 'Shulman' appears to be a variant or error for 'Shillman.' Evidence is based on investigative reporting and secondary sources, with no direct primary document like an official statement found.

**Verification Notes:** This claim refers to Freud's abandonment of his seduction theory in the late 1890s. Initially, Freud believed his patients' reports of childhood sexual abuse were literal, but under professional pressure, he reframed these accounts as fantasies, introducing concepts like the Oedipus complex. Historian Florence Rush coined the term 'Freudian Coverup' in 1971, and Jeffrey Masson's 1984 book 'The Assault on Truth' documented how Freud suppressed evidence of real sexual abuse. Multiple sources confirm that Freud transformed victims' abuse accounts into 'fantasies,' which scholars describe as a gaslighting framework.

A tense White House meeting was held including Patel, Kent, Gabbard, VP JD Vance, and Susie Wiles.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim describes a detailed timeline of events following Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025. The basic facts are confirmed: Kirk was shot at 12:23 PM and within seconds was carried to an SUV (CBS News reports 12:23:55 PM - approximately 40-55 seconds). George Zinn did falsely confess and was arrested in handcuffs, with widely circulated video showing his pants falling down during the arrest. The timeline details align with documented events, though exact timings (40 seconds, 10 seconds, 1 minute 15 seconds, 1 minute 48 seconds) appear to be Candace Owens' own analysis of video footage rather than officially confirmed timestamps.

**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is TRUE. Charlie Kirk was indeed taken to Timpanogos Regional Hospital after being shot on September 10, 2025 at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Timpanogos Regional Hospital is confirmed to be a Level III Trauma Center according to Utah Department of Health records. The claim accurately describes it as 'a smaller regional hospital' and a 'trauma III center.' Level III trauma centers can provide initial care for moderately severe injuries but typically transfer more severely injured patients to Level I or II centers. Kirk was shot in the neck, which would be considered a serious trauma.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including local news outlets and biographical profiles, confirm that Rob McCoy served as Mayor of Thousand Oaks from December 2018 through December 2019. The Borderline Bar and Grill shooting occurred on November 7, 2018, so his assumption of the mayoral role in December 2018 is approximately one month later. In Thousand Oaks, the mayor is selected annually by the city council from its members, which aligns with the claim's timeline and use of 'elected' in the context of council selection.

**Veracity:** True (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This reflects Candace Owens' characterization of Charlie Kirk's stated vision for TPUSA. While difficult to verify Kirk's exact internal intentions, his public statements and TPUSA's founding mission support this. Kirk founded TPUSA in 2012 as a conservative youth organization, became youngest speaker at 2016 RNC, and announced the Mount Vernon Project in 2022 to remove non-grassroots conservatives from RNC. Republican consultant Chuck Coughlin told NBC News TPUSA evolved into 'full takeover of the Republican Party.' The claim represents Owens' interpretation of Kirk's known public goals.

Robinson told his parents he didn't want 'a big SWAT team at his parent's house or his apartment.' Multiple credible news sources (PBS, Newsweek, ABC News, Fox News) confirm Robinson negotiated his surrender specifically because he feared being shot by police, and he turned himself in at the Washington County Sheriff's Office on September 11, 2025.

**Verification Notes:** The claim 'the moment he lost his life' is a reference to the video footage and images of Charlie Kirk being shot and killed on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University. This is a factually accurate statement - Kirk was indeed shot and killed, losing his life at that moment. The video of the assassination was widely circulated and documented. This is not a disputable factual claim but rather a descriptive reference to the documented event.

> The person that he adored the most—like, really, never in a million years did he think that he was going to meet him, and of course he did—was Rush Limbaugh

**Source:** [To My Friend, Charlie Kirk. @ 00:03:05](/episodes/ep-_dRaEO47-co.md#t-00-03-05)
**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** Charlie Kirk did meet Rush Limbaugh and greatly admired him. According to Limbaugh's January 11, 2018 radio broadcast, they met for the first time in December 2017 when Kirk was brought to Limbaugh's golf course in South Florida for a Turning Point USA conference. Kirk told Limbaugh he 'grew up in a home where my program was on all the time' and was 'effusively complimentary.' Kirk began listening to Rush during high school. The claim that Limbaugh was the person Kirk 'adored the most' and 'never thought he would meet' aligns with documented accounts of their relationship. Multiple sources confirm Kirk's deep admiration for Limbaugh.

**Source:** [To My Friend, Charlie Kirk. @ 00:03:31](/episodes/ep-_dRaEO47-co.md#t-00-03-31)
**Veracity:** True (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Verified as substantially true based on context. The speaker (likely a Turning Point co-founder) states this was Charlie Kirk's personal rule/philosophy about Fox News appearances - never declining invitations even for early morning shows, doing multiple hits per day. While we cannot verify the exact '4 a.m.' detail or 'four hits a day' frequency, Kirk was documented as a frequent Fox News guest, with his last appearance on Sept 9, 2025. This appears to be a first-hand account of Kirk's media strategy.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is verified as true. Charlie Kirk announced on November 21, 2017, that Candace Owens was hired as Turning Point USA's director of urban engagement. In October 2018, Owens launched the Blexit campaign at TPUSA's Young Black Leadership Summit. Kirk himself stated 'TPUSA was the incubator for some of the ideas that gave birth to the BLEXIT vision.' Multiple sources confirm Kirk's direct involvement and support during Blexit's founding period in 2018, substantiating Owens' statement that Charlie was 'right by my side when I started Blexit.'

**Verification Notes:** This claim is substantiated by multiple news sources. Christopher Moseley, husband of DuPont heiress Lisa Dean Moseley, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire in the death of Patricia Margello, a 45-year-old ex-prostitute. Margello's body was found Aug. 6, 1998, in a Las Vegas motel. Moseley admitted paying 5,000 to have her killed because his stepson Dean MacGuigan (Lisa's son) was dating her. Moseley died in federal prison in 2004 while serving a 16.5-year sentence. The claim accurately reflects reporting from Dominick Dunne in Vanity Fair and other news outlets.

According to Salt Lake Tribune and ABC News reporting on released UVU documents, after a July event request, Turning Point scouts arrived in early August and specifically chose the amphitheater location despite UVU's security concerns. Kirk's head of security Brian Harpole acknowledged being initially upset about the amphitheater assignment due to security vulnerabilities but confirmed Kirk wanted to be in that outdoor location to engage with students.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources and social media discussions, including articles from The Times of India and The Guardian, report on Candace Owens' podcast claims about discrepancies in the narrative surrounding Charlie Kirk's shooting, such as Mikey McCoy's position and lack of blood evidence. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) describe video footage showing McCoy behind the tent, walking away immediately after the shot without approaching Kirk, supporting the claim that he had no blood on him. No reliable sources refute this, though it mixes verifiable video analysis with interpretive conspiracy elements; confidence is medium due to reliance on secondary reports of video without direct primary access.

**Verification Notes:** Video analysis by multiple sources including Ian Carroll confirms that Mikey McCoy put his phone to his ear approximately 834 milliseconds (less than one second) after the gunshot. Frame-by-frame analysis shows McCoy's hand going up with phone in hand immediately after the shot, with no visible dialing motion. This specific timing measurement appears in Candace Owens' video analysis and has been discussed in multiple investigative reports. While the timing itself is verifiable from video evidence, the interpretation of what this timing means (suspicious vs. trauma response vs. following pre-established instructions) remains debated. The factual claim about the 834 millisecond timing is supported by video evidence.

**Verification Notes:** Candace Owens released screenshots of text messages allegedly from Charlie Kirk dated April 6, 2018, in which he states 'Since the beginning of TPUSA I knew in my gut that I might get wiped out at any time. I cannot explain it, but I dream about it all the time.' A TPUSA spokesperson stated the screenshots 'appear authentic' though they claim context is being misrepresented. The messages include Kirk comparing himself to Moses and saying he might not see the revolution through. While the authenticity of the text messages has been acknowledged by TPUSA, the subjective nature of Kirk's feelings and dreams cannot be independently verified beyond the existence of these messages. The claim accurately represents what Kirk wrote in the texts.

**Veracity:** True (medium)
**Verification Notes:** According to multiple sources, Charlie Kirk did visit Israel in 2019. Netanyahu stated in a Fox News interview following Kirk's assassination that 'my son actually, on his 2019 visit to Israel, had lunch with him and his wife Erika.' This confirms that during Kirk's 2019 Israel visit, he had lunch with Netanyahu's son and Erika Kirk. However, the claim as stated says Kirk had lunch with 'Benjamin Netanyahu and Erika Kirk' which could be read as Netanyahu himself being present. Netanyahu's statement specifies it was his son who had lunch with the Kirks, not Netanyahu personally. If the claim means Netanyahu's family/son, it's true. If it means Netanyahu himself was present at the lunch, that's not supported by the evidence. Marking as true with medium confidence given the ambiguity in the claim text.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** Verified as TRUE. Multiple reliable sources confirm Charlie Kirk's longstanding support for Israel and visits to the Holy Land. Kirk visited Israel at least twice - first in May 2018 for the U.S. embassy opening in Jerusalem, and again in 2019. He publicly stated 'Israel changed my life' and 'I believe in the Holy Land, I love that Jesus walked on water there and rose from the dead.' Kirk regularly defended Israel in campus debates and told audiences 'my whole life I have defended Israel.' He was posthumously awarded the Pillars of Jerusalem award by Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu eulogized him as 'A lion-hearted friend of Israel.' Sources confirm he viewed Israel as the Holy Land, visited multiple times, and was a faithful supporter throughout his career.

**Verification Notes:** This accurately describes Jeffrey Masson's thesis in 'The Assault on Truth' (1984). Masson argues Freud's patients reported childhood sexual abuse (often by parents/fathers) but Freud abandoned his 'seduction theory' and recharacterized reports as fantasies. Multiple sources confirm Masson documented that Freud's female patients reported being abused as children but Freud disbelieved them.

**Verification Notes:** The claim about a military-contracted plane departing Biggs Army Airfield at 6:13 a.m. and dipping to 300 feet over Provo airport is supported by flight tracking data. The aircraft (tail N1098L, owned by LASAI Aviation LLC, a defense contractor) did make unusual low-altitude maneuvers over Provo Municipal Airport on September 10, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the flight path, though the specific departure time and exact altitude require verification from primary flight tracking data.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is substantially true. Derek Maxfield, CEO of Komigo and owner of aircraft N888KG, did issue a statement on Instagram on September 11, 2025. In that statement, he wrote: 'Radar services with air traffic control were terminated in mutual agreement between Denver FAA center and N888KG approximately 10 miles from landing at PGA, which is consistent with generally accepted standard practice when flying in and out of non-towered airports.' While the speaker paraphrases this as 'got permission to turn off transponder services,' Maxfield's actual statement was that radar services were 'terminated in mutual agreement' with ATC, which is a similar concept.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** Confirmed true. Jack Posobiec served as a United States Navy intelligence officer. NBC News reported he was a 'Navy Intel Officer' and Military Times confirmed his service. He enlisted in U.S. Navy Reserves on May 25, 2010, was commissioned as an officer on October 31, 2013, and reached the rank of lieutenant junior grade. He was assigned to Office of Naval Intelligence from March 2014-March 2017, specifically at the Kennedy Irregular Warfare Center. He deployed for 10 months to Joint Task Force Guantanamo Bay performing human intelligence analysis. Posobiec has publicly acknowledged this service and resigned from ONI in March 2017. The claim correctly states he 'was' (past tense) a naval intelligence officer and that he has never denied it.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** The claim that intelligence agencies (FBI/CIA) recruit heavily from LDS/Mormon communities, particularly at BYU, is well-documented. Historical sources include: a 1971 Ramparts magazine article stating LDS provided 'some of their best men' to CIA/FBI; a 1981 AP story reporting 'CIA does some of its most successful recruiting in predominantly LDS Utah'; and a 2017 book 'FBI and Religion' dedicating a chapter to this connection. Deseret News, Atlas Obscura, and LDS Living have all reported on this recruitment pattern. The reasons cited include foreign language skills from missionary service, abstinence from drugs/alcohol, clean backgrounds for security clearance, and cultural fit. While exact numbers aren't public, the pattern is well-established in reporting.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim quotes what Candace Owens says a Turning Point USA individual told her about why SD cards were removed from cameras after Charlie Kirk's assassination. The claim is about what was said to Candace, not about the underlying facts. Andrew Kolvet, Charlie Kirk's longtime producer, publicly confirmed a similar account: a TPUSA staffer removed SD cards from cameras after the shooting to protect them from potential theft, with Kolvet stating the staffer said 'I know people can be evil' and didn't want footage grabbed by someone. Kolvet's public statement aligns with what Candace reports being told - that the motivation was emotional protection of footage/Erika, not police instruction. Tyler Bowyer separately claimed police requested the cards, which contradicts what Candace reports. The claim accurately represents what Candace says she was told.

**Veracity:** True (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is substantially true. According to a Fox News article citing a relative of Lance Twiggs, Twiggs was kicked out of his parents' home at age 18. The relative stated Twiggs was struggling with substance abuse issues, gaming addiction, and grappling with gender identity. The article specifically states 'Lance Twiggs... was kicked out of his parents home due to substance abuse and gaming addiction issues' and that 'The 22-year-old is in the process of transitioning from male to female. He was kicked out of his parents home at the age of 18.' However, the exact timing ('junior year of high school') cannot be precisely confirmed.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple credible sources confirm Lance Twiggs was kicked out by his parents during high school. Fox News reports a family member stated his father thought he was 'disrespectful and problematic' and kicked him out during junior year.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** The claim states that the person 'turned 22 back in August.' According to multiple sources including Wikipedia and NBC News, Tyler Robinson was born April 16, 2003, which would make him 22 years old as of the shooting in September 2025. If he turned 22 in April 2003, then he would have been 22 'back in August' of 2025. However, the context suggests this may be referring to Lance Twiggs, Robinson's roommate.

**Verification Notes:** A fact-check article and other news reports from reliable outlets like The Times of Israel and Israel Hayom confirm that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended a personal invitation to Charlie Kirk to visit Israel shortly before his death in September 2025. While some sources attribute a similar invitation to Minister Amichai Chikli for a January conference, the fact-check specifically verifies Netanyahu's involvement, supporting the claim of a conversation and invitation a few weeks prior. The exact details of the 'speech' (e.g., phone call vs. other communication) are not contradicted but not fully detailed in all sources, leading to medium confidence.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** Candace Owens was fired from The Daily Wire in March 2024. Multiple sources confirm this, including CNN, Variety, and NBC News. The Daily Wire CEO Jeremy Boreing announced 'Daily Wire and Candace Owens have ended their relationship' on March 22, 2024. Her departure followed months of tensions with Ben Shapiro over her criticism of Israel and alleged antisemitic comments.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** Candace Owens was suspended from YouTube for one week and fully demonetized in September 2024 following violations of YouTube's policies, particularly after her interview with Kanye West that included antisemitic content. YouTube removed at least one video for 'claims that Jewish people control the media.' YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon confirmed the suspension and demonetization. This was not a permanent ban but a temporary suspension with demonetization. The term 'canceled' as used by Owens refers to this suspension and demonetization action.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** Verified as TRUE. Amazon confirmed both parts of the claim. An Amazon spokesperson stated: 'The title in question is no longer available for sale. Due to a technical issue, the date of publication that had been displayed for this title, while it was briefly listed, was incorrect, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused. The title was published late in the afternoon on September 10th.' This confirms: (1) Amazon blamed the incorrect publication date on technical issues, and (2) Amazon removed the book. The book was about Charlie Kirk's assassination and appeared with a Sept 9 date despite being published Sept 10. Multiple fact-checkers verified Amazon's response and book removal.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Verification Notes:** Confirmed: Utah musician Skye Valadez (God's Finest Scalpel) posted a song titled 'Charlie Kirk Dead at 31' prior to the assassination. The song was removed and social media deleted after Kirk's death. The claim about the feds suddenly identifying Tyler Robinson is part of Candace's narrative but the artist and song existence is factually accurate.

**Verification Notes:** Verified: Sigmund Freud joined the Vienna Lodge of B'nai B'rith in September 1897. He delivered 27 lectures to B'nai B'rith between 1897 and 1917. This membership was significant because the B'nai B'rith provided Freud his first audience when European academia rejected his early psychoanalytic work.

**Source:** [Leo Frank Case - New Georgia Encyclopedia](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/leo-frank-case/)
**Verification Notes:** Leo Frank was indeed found guilty by a jury on August 25, 1913, for the murder of Mary Phagan in Atlanta. This is well-documented historical fact confirmed by multiple sources including the Library of Congress, New Georgia Encyclopedia, and Famous Trials. The trial lasted 25 days, and the verdict was announced on August 25, 1913. Frank was later lynched on August 17, 1915, and posthumously pardoned in 1986 (not for innocence, but because the lynching deprived him of further appeals).

**Verification Notes:** FBI Director Kash Patel did indeed write this in a tweet/X post when announcing the end of the FBI's partnership with the ADL. The exact quote was: 'James Comey wrote love letters to the ADL and embedded FBI agents with them - a group that ran disgraceful ops spying on Americans.' This was widely reported by multiple news outlets including Fox News, Newsweek, and Axios in late September/early October 2025, following the Kirk assassination.

The 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment's 4th Company trained with US Marines at Twentynine Palms, California during Service Level Training Exercise 4-25 from August 4-25, 2025.

**Verification Notes:** Confirmed accurate. The French Ministry of Armed Forces did formally deny training at 'Camp Riley' Minnesota, stating no such camp exists. Camp Ripley (correct spelling) does exist in Minnesota and has hosted international military training. The ministry's statement focused on the spelling error rather than addressing whether any training occurred at Camp Ripley. Multiple sources confirm this response including France24 and fact-checking articles.

**Verification Notes:** Confirmed by Foreign Legion Information. Article published August 20, 2025 documents 'Foreign Legion: 2025 Change of Command took place in six regiments' during summer 2025.

**Verification Notes:** An Egyptian government-owned Dassault Falcon 7X with registration SU-BTT did travel from Provo, Utah to Wilmington, Delaware around the timeframe described. Multiple sources confirm the aircraft's movements (jetphotos.com/registration/SU-BTT) and that it is one of four Falcon jets owned by the Egyptian government. The plane was photographed at Wilmington New Castle County Airport on August 23, 2025. While some timeline details have been disputed in fact-checks, the core assertion about the plane's route from Provo to Wilmington is supported by flight tracking data and photographic evidence.

**Verification Notes:** Verified that Incyte, a global biopharmaceutical company, owns the Bracebridge buildings at 1100 North King Street on Rodney Square in Wilmington, Delaware. Multiple sources confirm that in May 2024, Incyte announced the renovation was 'expected to take about a year, depending on construction issues.' This matches the claim exactly. Incyte purchased the former MBNA buildings and planned to renovate Bracebridge I first, with an estimated one-year timeline announced in May 2024.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including ABC News, NBC News, and The Guardian, confirm that Australian Immigration Minister Tony Burke denied Candace Owens a visa in October 2024, effectively banning her from entering the country for a speaking tour. The decision was based on character grounds and concerns she could incite discord. Australia's High Court upheld the ban in October 2025. The claim refers to Owens being banned, with 'us' likely meaning her and her associated tour or show, which aligns with the evidence.

**Verification Notes:** News reports and posts found on X about Erika Kirk's interview with Jesse Watters indicate she discussed seeing evidence related to her husband's death, including the autopsy report.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable news sources like Yahoo Finance and Fortune report that Turning Point USA had $85 million in revenue from a network of 500,000 donors following Charlie Kirk's death in September 2025, indicating a significant surge in donations post-death. Additional sources from The Guardian and Newsweek confirm increased fundraising and donations after the event, with one mentioning a $1 million pledge. Posts on X also reference figures around $80-90 million in the weeks following his death, supporting the claim's approximation of $90 million in that timeframe. Prior revenue was lower (e.g., $39.2 million in 2020), suggesting the jump includes post-death contributions. The claim is supported as an approximate figure, though exact timing and breakdown are not fully detailed in primary sources.

**Verification Notes:** The American Jewish Committee (AJC) did not call Charlie Kirk an 'anti-Semite and dangerous' in an official statement. After Kirk's assassination, the AJC released a statement saying they were 'horrified by the shooting' and condemned the 'disturbing act of political violence.' The AJC did criticize Kirk for spreading conspiracy theories about Jeffrey Epstein and Mossad, but did not use the specific language claimed. Other organizations like the ADL criticized Kirk's platform, and the Democratic Majority for Israel mentioned his 'antisemitic statements,' but the specific AJC statement described in the claim does not exist.

Bowyer met Kirk in 2014 (two years after founding) when Bowyer was chairman of Maricopa County Republican Committee, and joined TPUSA in 2015, becoming COO in 2017.

**Verification Notes:** FALSE: The actual Chief Medical Examiner who handled Charlie Kirk's autopsy in Utah was Dr. Deirdre Amaro (not Dr. Lydia Smith-Amaro). No records exist of a medical examiner named 'Dr. Lydia Smith-Amaro' connected to this case. Dr. Deirdre Amaro is Utah's Chief Medical Examiner and serves on Governor Cox's Fentanyl Task Force.

However, the salary portion is accurate: compensation increased from 7 million (2022) to 0 million (2023) despite the staff reduction.

**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** Confirmed FALSE. 'Operation Mockingpastor' is not an official CIA operation - it appears to be a term coined by Candace Owens, playing on the historical 'Operation Mockingbird' (alleged CIA media influence program). While the CIA did historically use clergy as intelligence operatives (documented by 1996 Senate hearings showing CIA used 21 clergy/missionaries), there is no official operation called 'Mockingpastor.' The term appears to be Owens' recent coinage to describe alleged CIA influence over pastors.

**Verification Notes:** The claim says 'clearing like a hundred million a year' but the evidence shows TPUSA had 5 million in revenue in 2024 (not clearing/net profit). Their expenses were 1 million, leaving only about  million in net assets gained that year. 'Clearing' typically means net profit, not gross revenue.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple sources confirm that Charlie Kirk's security team did NOT have drones monitoring the event. Utah Valley University lacked drone surveillance, and this absence was identified as a major security failure. The university deployed only 6 officers and no drones.

**Verification Notes:** This conspiracy theory claim about different people on an Egyptian military plane was debunked. Candace Owens promoted this theory but made a critical time zone error - she misread UTC time as local Utah time, claiming the plane departed after Kirk's assassination when it actually left at 7:08 AM local time, hours before the shooting. Law enforcement confirmed Tyler Robinson as the sole suspect with no evidence of foreign involvement. The theory lacked independent verification of flight logs or passenger manifests.

**Verification Notes:** Brian Cole Jr. (30-year-old male from Woodbridge, VA) was arrested by FBI on Dec 4, 2025 for planting the Jan 6 pipe bombs. The claim naming 'Shawna Rae Kirkhoff' originated from a Nov 8, 2025 Blaze News report that was retracted on Dec 4, 2025.

The plane departed Provo at 7am local time on Sept 10, well before Kirk was shot that afternoon. FBI Director Kash Patel ruled out any connection between the plane and the shooting.

He confessed on Discord 2 hours before arrest, confessed to his father and family friend, and charging documents confirm he 'implied that he was the shooter' and explained his motive.

**Veracity:** False (high)

The texts included 'I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it' and 'I had enough of his hatred.' These messages became key evidence in charging Robinson. While conspiracy theories emerged questioning their authenticity, no credible evidence supports they were fabricated. The claim that Tyler 'absolutely did not author those text messages' is contradicted by official legal proceedings.

**Verification Notes:** FBI released multiple videos and images of the Charlie Kirk shooter (Tyler James Robinson, 22-year-old male). All official FBI releases and news coverage show a single male suspect. There is no credible evidence or official acknowledgment of a woman being with the shooter.

Andrew Kolvet (TPUSA executive producer) confirmed that Mikey called Erika Kirk first, following Charlie's prior instructions. Erika Kirk herself confirmed receiving the first call from Mikey. Both Rob McCoy and Erika Kirk claimed to have received calls 'at the exact moment' of the shooting, which is impossible.

**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** The claim states someone cheered at 'that university' when Charlie was shot. Context indicates this refers to Utah Valley University (UVU) where Kirk was assassinated on September 10, 2025. Extensive news coverage describes the moment of shooting: audience members 'gasped, exhaled for a beat, then rose up in screams of horror.' The cheering mentioned in accounts occurred moments BEFORE the shooting, in response to Kirk's debate quip. No credible sources document anyone cheering after the shooting occurred.

**Verification Notes:** This claim states TPUSA made '80 million plus dollars' in merchandise sales 'in the first three weeks' after Charlie Kirk's death. According to verified sources, TPUSA sold over 520,000 items of merchandise post-assassination (at roughly 5 per shirt), which equals approximately 8.2M max if all were shirts - far short of 0M. TPUSA's total organizational revenue for all of 2024 was 5M from all sources (99.2% charitable contributions), not merchandise alone. The claim significantly overstates merchandise revenue by conflating total organizational revenue with merchandise-only sales in a specific timeframe.

The plane's dip over Provo occurred at 9:16 a.m. Mountain Time. The time difference between the dip (9:16 a.m.) and the shooting (12:23 p.m.) is approximately 3 hours and 7 minutes, not 26 minutes.

**Verification Notes:** CORRECTED: Multiple reliable sources (Wikipedia, Fox News, CNN, court documents) confirm Tyler Robinson WAS on UVU campus and fired from the LOSEE CENTER roof, NOT the Woodbury Building. The claim has two parts: (1) 'not on the Woodbury Building' - this part is TRUE (he was on Losee Center), (2) 'not on campus at all' - this part is FALSE (extensive evidence he was on campus). Since claim uses 'or' connecting both parts, and the second part is demonstrably false, the overall claim is FALSE. Robinson entered campus at 11:51 AM, entered Losee Center, climbed to roof via public walkway, and was in prone sniper position by 12:22 PM, approximately 430 feet from Kirk. Evidence includes surveillance footage, forensic evidence on roof, DNA on weapon found nearby, and official court filings.

**Verification Notes:** Death certificates typically document cause and manner of death but do not routinely include specific forensic details like bullet caliber. According to CDC and NCBI medical examiner guidelines (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526015/), while autopsy reports contain detailed ballistic information, the death certificate itself follows WHO-recommended formats that focus on underlying cause of death rather than forensic evidence details. The claim's assumption that bullet caliber would be 'reflected onto' a death certificate is inconsistent with standard death certification practices.

**Verification Notes:** This claim is false. Jason Chaffetz's parents were not in the FBI. His father John A. Chaffetz was a businessman, and his mother Margaret (Peggy) Wood ran a photography business. However, Chaffetz's GRANDFATHER, Maxwell (Max) Chaffetz (1909-1986), was an FBI Special Agent. The speaker confused the generation - it was his grandfather, not his parents, who worked in the FBI. Sources: Wikipedia article on Jason Chaffetz.

**Veracity:** False (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is false. While N1098L is a real aircraft (a 2023 Bombardier Global 6500 registered to Lasai Aviation II and contracted to the U.S. Army via Leidos for training), FlightAware records show no activity near Provo, Utah on September 10, 2025 (the date of Charlie Kirk's assassination). The aircraft's recent documented flights were elsewhere, such as September 25 from Topeka to Biggs. This appears to be a conspiracy theory similar to the debunked claims about aircraft N888KG.

**Verification Notes:** The speaker claims to have tweeted 'No person, nobody, no nation anywhere in the world has a right to commit genocide.' However, the actual tweet from November 3, 2023 stated: 'No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever.' The wording is different - the actual tweet said 'No government' not 'No person, nobody, no nation.' While the substance is similar, the exact quote is inaccurate.

**Verification Notes:** FACTUAL ERROR: The USS Liberty incident occurred on June 8, 1967, NOT 1960 as claimed. The speaker misstated the year by 7 years. The attack did occur (Israel attacked USS Liberty during the Six-Day War, killing 34 and wounding ~170), but the date in the claim is incorrect. Israel apologized and called it a case of mistaken identity. The claim is marked FALSE due to the incorrect date.

**Verification Notes:** The dates are incorrect. According to multiple sources including Fortune and Sportskeeda, Owens first discussed Brigitte Macron on The Daily Wire on March 11, 2024 (not March 13), in an episode titled 'INSANE. This Is The BIGGEST Political Scandal In Human History.' She was notified of her termination on March 18, 2024 (according to her own account), and the public announcement was March 22, 2024 (not March 19).

**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** The claim states Owens was fired 'six days' after the March 13, 2024 Brigitte Macron episode. March 13 + 6 days = March 19. However, the Daily Wire announced the split on March 22, 2024, which is 9 days after March 13, not 6. In the transcript, Owens says 'March 19th, just six days later' but corrects herself saying 'I thought it was 10; it's actually six days later.' The actual timeline shows March 13 to March 22 is 9 days. The speaker appears to have miscalculated.

**Verification Notes:** Official reports and court documents describe the gun as being found in woods/bushes near UVU campus, wrapped in a towel. Text messages from Robinson mention leaving the rifle 'in a bush.' While the general area matches (gun found in residential area near campus), there is no mention of a 'chicken coop' in any official reports, only in this local source's account. The gun was found in wooded area, not specifically at a chicken coop.

**Source:** [EXCLUSIVE! Another Photo Of Tyler Robinson | Candace Ep 238 @ 00:41:19](/episodes/ep-sreYYcID-QY.md#t-00-41-19)
**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is FALSE. Research shows no evidence that Turning Point USA issued an official organizational statement supporting Candace Owens' 'Christ is King' controversy when she was fired from The Daily Wire in March 2024. The timeline shows: 1) Owens was fired from Daily Wire on March 22, 2024, 2) The 'Christ is King' controversy erupted online around March 24-25, 2024 with users defending Owens against Ben Shapiro, 3) While Owens has maintained connections with TPUSA and spoke at their events in 2024, no official TPUSA organizational statement of support for the 'Christ is King' matter has been documented. The speaker may be conflating Owens' personal relationship with Charlie Kirk or TPUSA with an official organizational statement. Sources: Wikipedia, Know Your Meme, EEW Magazine.

**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** This is a conspiracy theory promoted by Candace Owens and others. The claim that Brigitte Macron was born male as Jean-Michel Trogneux is demonstrably false. Jean-Michel Trogneux is Brigitte's 80-year-old brother who lives in Amiens and has appeared publicly with her at Emmanuel Macron's presidential inaugurations. Birth records, childhood photos, communion photos, and first wedding photos all confirm Brigitte Macron was born female. French courts found purveyors of this theory guilty of libel (though later overturned on appeal). The Macrons sued Owens for defamation in Delaware in July 2025.

**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** False: Only one person has been arrested and charged with Charlie Kirk's assassination: Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old from Washington County, Utah. Law enforcement has consistently stated he acted alone. No evidence of 'two assassins' or involvement of an 'Israeli' or 'French-Canadian woman.' This appears to be conspiracy theory content.

**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** Verified FALSE. The context shows this claim is actually what critics were saying about Candace Owens ('Trump never called her'), which she is refuting. Multiple credible sources confirm Trump DID call Candace Owens about Brigitte Macron in February 2025. Sources including Mediaite, TMZ, The Pink News, and The Advocate all report that Owens claims Trump called her on February 26, 2025 asking her to stop talking about Brigitte Macron. The White House declined to comment on the alleged call. The claim as stated is false because Trump did call her (according to Owens and not denied by the White House).

**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** The claim states Operation Bright Star took place from August 29 to September 10, 2024. However, Operation Bright Star is a biennial exercise that did NOT occur in 2024. Bright Star 23 took place Aug 31-Sept 14, 2023, and Bright Star 25 took place Aug 28-Sept 10, 2025. The dates given (Aug 29-Sept 10) roughly match the 2025 exercise dates, but the year 2024 is factually incorrect.

**Source:** [Charlie Kirk And Brigitte's Legionnaires | Candace Ep 271 @ 00:58:05](/episodes/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU.md#t-00-58-05)
**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim states 'they chose to publicly execute Charlie Kirk and then to dare us to question the narrative.' In context, this is the speaker's interpretative statement suggesting intentional orchestration, not a factual claim about verified events. Charlie Kirk was indeed assassinated publicly on September 10, 2025 at Utah Valley University. However, the shooter has been identified as 22-year-old Tyler James Robinson who surrendered to police and was charged with aggravated murder. There is no verified evidence that 'they' (implying a coordinated group) 'chose' to execute Kirk as an intentional demonstration of power. This is the speaker's opinion/interpretation of events, presented as if it were established fact. As a factual assertion, it is false - it conflates a real assassination with an unproven conspiracy theory about its orchestration.

**Source:** [Charlie Kirk And Brigitte's Legionnaires | Candace Ep 271 @ 00:59:13](/episodes/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU.md#t-00-59-13)
**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** Confirmed FALSE. This is a conspiracy theory promoted by Candace Owens without credible evidence. While Owens claimed 12 Israeli cell phones and French Foreign Legionnaires were present at the Kirk assassination, these claims lack credible verification. France's Ministry of Armed Forces explicitly denied Tyler Robinson was ever a member of the French Foreign Legion. Regarding the cell phones, reports indicate NSA may have detected 12 foreign-registered phones, but confirmation they were Israeli is absent from reliable sources - characterized as 'unverified conspiracy theories' by fact-checkers. No credible evidence supports National Guard involvement either.

**Source:** [Charlie Kirk And Brigitte's Legionnaires | Candace Ep 271 @ 01:00:05](/episodes/ep-tB5SXXmd9vU.md#t-01-00-05)
**Veracity:** False (high)
**Verification Notes:** The claim suggests the Trogneux chocolatier business could not have operated continuously from the 1880s through now due to Nazi occupation and bombardment of Amiens. However, historical records show Jean Trogneux chocolatier was established in 1872 and has been run by six generations of the family continuously to present day. While Amiens was indeed occupied by Nazis in WWII and suffered Allied bombardments, the business evidently survived these events, as it operates today under the same family ownership since 1872.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim has the qualifier 'apparently' which makes it a report of an allegation rather than a factual assertion. Candace Owens did make this allegation on Nov 22, 2025, asking 'Do you mind answering yes or no if anyone who trained with the French Foreign Legion was on the ground on September 10 at Utah Valley University?' So the allegation WAS made. However, French Ministry of Armed Forces denied Robinson trained with Legion, and there is no evidence of Legion personnel in Utah on 9/10/25. The allegation itself is documented but unsubstantiated. Marking as MIXED: the allegation was made (true) but lacks evidence (false).

**Verification Notes:** Official U.S. State Department guidelines confirm that foreign state aircraft, including military jets, require diplomatic clearance to enter and operate in U.S. airspace, ensuring federal government awareness and approval. Multiple sources, including FAA and DoD documents, support that such landings are monitored and cannot occur without attention. However, the claim's assertion of a required 'federal escort' (implying physical or airborne accompaniment) is not explicitly mandated in these policies; escorts may be provided in specific security contexts (e.g., interceptions per FAA guidelines) but are not a standard requirement for cleared flights.

**Verification Notes:** The claim that Joyce Chernick is married to Aubrey Chernick and that they fund pro-Israel causes through the David Horowitz Freedom Center is supported by reliable sources, including articles detailing their philanthropic activities and connections to conservative, pro-Israel organizations. However, the specific assertion that Joyce Chernick yelled and withdrew a $1 million donation from Turning Point USA due to Tucker Carlson's speech is primarily based on Candace Owens' statements and echoed in social media posts on X, but lacks confirmation from primary sources like official statements, TPUSA records, or established news outlets. Verification would require access to internal TPUSA donor communications, leaked audio footage mentioned in the podcast, or public statements from the Chernicks or TPUSA.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The claim about NY Post exclusives is partially true. They did publish photos of Ghislaine Maxwell at In-N-Out in 2019 (not an 'exclusive find' but a potentially staged photo). However, the major Epstein death photos were published by 60 Minutes/CBS, not NY Post as exclusive.

**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** FBI Special Agent Robert Bohls held a press conference at 7:19 a.m. Mountain Time on September 11, 2025, announcing the recovery of the weapon. The FBI released photos of the person of interest at 10:00 a.m. Mountain Time, followed by a 100k reward announcement at 10:45 a.m. The claim states the New York Post published an exclusive photo at 9:21 a.m. Mountain Time (11:21 a.m. Eastern), which would be BEFORE the FBI released official photos at 10 a.m. I found references to the New York Post covering the gun discovery but no confirmation of an 'exclusive' photo at 9:21 a.m. The timing discrepancy (NYP publishing before FBI release) raises questions but cannot be definitively confirmed or refuted.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_James_Robinson)
**Verification Notes:** The claim mixes accurate and inaccurate timing. Tyler Robinson was taken into custody on Sept 11, 2025, but not at 7pm - official sources confirm he was arrested at approximately 10pm at the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Hurricane, Utah. The 'Warner Valley' location is approximate - Robinson's parents lived in Washington, Utah (near Warner Valley area in Washington County). Local texts may have circulated around 7pm about the suspect being identified, but the actual arrest occurred at 10pm, making the total manhunt 33 hours from the shooting.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** FBI Director Kash Patel stated Robinson was apprehended in '33 hours' and emphasized this timeline at press conference.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim comes from Tucker Carlson's statements about Kirk's views. Web search confirms Carlson did claim Kirk felt Netanyahu was 'a very destructive force' and was 'appalled by what was happening in Gaza.' However, this characterization is disputed. Senator Ted Cruz contradicted this, noting Kirk was 'deeply concerned about rising antisemitism on the right.' Kirk's own writings show he was pro-Israel but warned Netanyahu about losing American support and questioned Israel's security failures. The claim reflects one person's characterization of Kirk's views, which is disputed by others who knew him. Kirk's actual views appear more nuanced than this simple statement suggests.

**Source:** [The Great Exodus From Utah? Where Did The "Egyptians" Go ... @ 00:29:51](/episodes/ep-581dILVcEE4.md#t-00-29-51)
**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Verified as MIXED. The claim conflates terminology and regulations. Brian Harpole stated he 'can't fly it' because 'the area lies in the Provo, Utah airspace' and referenced '107B' as a restriction. However, FAA drone regulations are codified under 'Part 107' (14 CFR Part 107), not 'Part 107B.' Subpart B of Part 107 deals with operating rules and airspace restrictions requiring ATC authorization in Class B, C, D, and E controlled airspace. The Provo area likely has controlled airspace restrictions near airports requiring LAANC authorization. While Harpole's core point about airspace restrictions preventing unauthorized drone flights is accurate, the specific regulation reference '107B' as stated is imprecise. The claim accurately reflects operational restrictions but uses non-standard regulatory terminology. Sources: FAA Part 107 regulations, UVU drone policy, UAV Coach Utah laws.

**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Verification Notes:** JFK's administration (specifically AG Robert F. Kennedy) did pressure the American Zionist Council to register under FARA in Nov 1962. Senate hearings in 1963 under Fulbright revealed Israel lobbying. JFK was assassinated Nov 22, 1963, before enforcement completed. The claim about 'before he was shot' is technically accurate but implies causation.

His credentials as a special warfare operator with direct experience in combat shooting are verifiable and true. However, his specific forensic conclusions about wound types based on video observation ('That was not an entry wound...

**Verification Notes:** This statement comes from Rob O'Neill, a verified former Navy SEAL with extensive combat experience. The factual component - that Rob O'Neill has shot people in combat - is consistent with his documented military service record including 400+ combat missions and multiple combat decorations. However, his observation about shirt movement ('their shirts didn't move like that') is expert analysis based on comparing past experiences to video footage, which is professional opinion rather than objectively verifiable fact. The claim combines verified experience (he has shot people) with subjective comparative analysis.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The claim that Courtney Love was experimented on at the Haight-Ashbury Clinic as a toddler is MIXED. What is documented: (1) Courtney Love was born in 1964 and spent early childhood in Haight-Ashbury during the hippie era; (2) During her parents' 1970 divorce, her mother Linda Carroll testified that her father Hank Harrison gave her LSD as a toddler (Harrison denied this); (3) Louis Jolyon West, an LSD researcher involved in MKUltra, lived near the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic and was allowed to recruit clients for experiments. However, there is no independent verification that Love was specifically experimented on AT the clinic as part of CIA programs. The LSD allegations stem from divorce proceedings, not documented CIA experiments. Candace Owens claims Love told her this directly in 2025, but this hasn't been independently verified.

**Source:** [From Britney To Charlie. With Pastors Like These, Who Nee... @ 00:30:38](/episodes/ep-7RLtGgkTh9o.md#t-00-30-38)
**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** CLAIM: 'the hippie movement was not organic. It was not real. It was a psychological operation. That is a fact'

ANALYSIS: This claim requires careful evaluation. The assertion that the hippie movement was 'a psychological operation' as a definitive 'fact' is not supported by mainstream historical consensus, but there are documented connections between CIA activities and elements of the counterculture that complicate a simple true/false determination.

EVIDENCE FOR INFLUENCE (not intentional creation):
1. MKUltra was a documented CIA program (1953-1973) that conducted LSD experiments
2. Some early counterculture figures participated in CIA LSD experiments: Ken Kesey (author), Allen Ginsberg (poet), and others at Stanford and other facilities
3. Dr. Louis Jolyon 'Jolly' West, a CIA MKUltra contractor, operated near the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic and recruited subjects
4. Author Stephen Kinzer acknowledged the CIA was 'an unwitting midwife to the birth of the acid generation'
5. The CIA did monitor and infiltrate counterculture groups (COINTELPRO documented)

EVIDENCE AGAINST INTENTIONAL CREATION:
1. Mainstream historians view the hippie movement as organic, arising from: post-WWII demographics, civil rights movement, Vietnam War opposition, Beat Generation, changing social norms
2. Investigative journalist Martin A. Lee states the CIA was only 'one of many' factors, 'a comingling of all these divergent streams'
3. The theory that CIA intentionally created the movement remains a conspiracy theory without conclusive proof
4. The Haight Ashbury Free Clinic allegations lack definitive proof - speculation based on West's presence and destroyed MKUltra documents

VERACITY: MIXED - The claim overstates certainty ('That is a fact'). The CIA did conduct experiments that inadvertently influenced counterculture (documented), but claiming the entire movement was 'not organic' and was 'a psychological operation' goes beyond what evidence supports. The movement had genuine grassroots origins while also being influenced/monitored by intelligence agencies.

However, FBI Director Kash Patel and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy have stated that investigations into transponder-related conspiracy theories found no evidence of suspicious activity. Patel stated that after interviews with pilots and FAA consultation, transponder gaps were caused by incomplete flight data in rural areas, not intentional shutoff. The FAA confirmed transponders were never turned off. While Owens made specific claims about the plane's transponder activity, official investigations have disputed the suspicious nature of these activities.

**Verification Notes:** According to National File reporting in November 2025, Candace Owens reported that TPUSA reached out to Matt Walsh to host Charlie Kirk's show after his death, and the request was met with a condition from The Daily Wire that Ben Shapiro also be invited. However, the specific detail about whether this was a condition for hosting versus a condition that emerged during planning is important. Multiple sources confirm that Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, and Michael Knowles did jointly host The Charlie Kirk Show on September 16, 2025. The claim is partially verifiable but the exact nature of the 'condition' and who imposed it remains disputed - Owens claims it came from Daily Wire, while others suggest TPUSA voluntarily invited all three hosts.

If there were angry confrontations, threats, or coercion, I didn't witness or hear about any of it.'

According to Newsworthy Women reporting, Owens claims 'outside journalists have engaged forensic accountants' and that she's 'not exactly a forensic accountant' but knows journalists 'who were similarly receiving leaks and have pushed this off to forensic accountants.' However, these are CLAIMS about hiring investigators, not verified independent confirmation. TPUSA has disputed these allegations, with producer Blake Neff stating 'none of it ever pans out, because from the start, there has been nothing there.' The claim reflects what Owens has publicly stated, but independent verification of forensic accountants being hired and their findings is not available. This is a self-reported claim.

**Verification Notes:** This claim is mixed. While Charlie Kirk did state this in May 2025, the accuracy of the underlying assertion is questionable. The March 2025 declassified JFK files did trigger widespread social media speculation about Mossad involvement, but fact-checkers found no direct documentary evidence in the released files proving Mossad was involved. Kirk's claim that 'Mossad is mentioned' in the files appears to conflate social media discussion and conspiracy theories with actual documentary evidence. The files themselves don't provide a 'smoking gun' document proving Mossad orchestration, though the topic has been discussed by historians like Martin Sandler.

(2) TPUSA involved in Scottsdale politics - TRUE (events there, Kirk lived there). HQ is actually Phoenix.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The claim states April 2024, but verified sources show the UNC Chapel Hill Live Free Tour event with Candace Owens was on March 6, 2024, not April. TPUSA announced the Spring 2024 Live Free Tour featuring both Kirk and Owens, with plans to visit six campuses. The tour did occur in spring 2024, but the specific month is incorrect - it was March, not April. The claim is partially true but contains a factual error about the specific timing.

A later November 2025 report states he 'dumped nearly $2 million' into stopping Mamdani, which is close to but not exactly $1.75 million.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable news sources, including the New York Daily News and Yahoo News, confirm Joe Gebbia donated $2 million to super PACs supporting Andrew Cuomo in opposition to Zohran Mamdani in the 2025 NYC mayoral race. Posts found on X from journalists and Mamdani himself reference donations of $2 million or $3 million to anti-Mamdani efforts.

**Verification Notes:** Andrew Kolvet did make statements about Charlie Kirk's neck stopping a .30-06 bullet, calling it a 'miracle.' However, Kolvet attributed this to the surgeon's claim about Charlie's bone density being 'impressive' and him being 'like the man of steel,' not specifically to 'eating salad.' Kolvet stated the surgeon said 'the bone was so healthy and the density was so impressive.' The salad eating detail is not verified in the statement.

**Verification Notes:** Mixed and contested accounts exist. Candace Owens claimed (Nov 2025) that UVU recommended against the amphitheater for safety reasons but TPUSA insisted on outdoor location. However, UVU officials stated Kirk's team specifically requested the outdoor courtyard space. Security director Brian Harpole stated he was 'initially upset' about the outdoor amphitheater assignment and claims he recommended an indoor secured amphitheater but was denied by university officials. Conflicting narratives make this difficult to verify definitively. Sources: Sportskeeda, Salt Lake Tribune, KSL.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** MIXED: Kindergarten was founded by Friedrich Froebel in Germany in 1837, not communists. However, after the failed 1848 revolution, the Prussian government did denounce Froebel and his supporters as 'socialists and revolutionaries' and banned kindergartens in 1851. Margarethe Schurz and her husband (both liberal reformers who fled Germany after 1848) did establish the first US kindergarten in 1856. The claim conflates liberal/socialist reform movements with communist ideology and oversimplifies the political motivations.

**Verification Notes:** Partially verifiable. There is evidence Kirk discussed having ADHD as a child in public statements (referenced in podcast 'Charlie Kirk had ADHD' about a TPUSA Facebook video from ~4 years before 2025). However, the specific details about being 'extremely gifted,' attending a 'school for the gifted,' and his parents refusing medication are based on Candace Owens' personal recollections of stories Charlie told her, not independently verifiable public records.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The claim that Rob McCoy was added to TPUSA Wikipedia page 'for the first time' on September 11, 2025 (less than 36 hours after Charlie Kirk's death) cannot be fully verified without access to Wikipedia edit history. However, multiple sources confirm Rob McCoy is legitimately co-founder of TPUSA Faith (founded 2021 with Charlie Kirk after Liberty University ended Kirk's Falkirk Center contract). McCoy is listed as co-founder on official TPUSA Faith website and in Wikipedia's current version. The timing of when this information was first added to Wikipedia cannot be verified through web search. The underlying fact - that McCoy co-founded TPUSA Faith - is TRUE, but the claim about when it was added to Wikipedia is UNVERIFIABLE.

The claim about a Wikipedia section stating he founded it alone appears true, but that Wikipedia content was incomplete/inaccurate since McCoy was actually a co-founder.

**Verification Notes:** REVISED VERIFICATION: The claim is PARTIALLY TRUE. Business directories like Buzzfile list the DEA at 920 N King St, Wilmington (Paul Moloney, Branch Manager, 302-573-6184). Yelp lists Secret Service at same address. DOJ directory from 2000 confirms DEA Wilmington Resident Office was at Suite 404, One Rodney Square, 920 King Street. However, other sources show Secret Service at 500 Delaware Ave. The building is One Rodney Square, a commercial office building that historically housed federal agencies. Some public directories DO show these agencies at this address, though it's unclear if current or legacy listings. Original FALSE rating was too strong - directories DO list agencies there.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Source:** [Field Offices | Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)
**Verification Notes:** CLAIM ANALYSIS: This claim has two parts - (1) that Googling 'FBI Wilmington Resident Agency' shows 920 North King Street in Google's info panel, and (2) that this address is labeled as FBI. FINDINGS: The official FBI Wilmington address is 500 Delaware Ave Suite 300. 920 North King Street is publicly listed as Richards, Layton & Finger law firm (One Rodney Square). Public records show no FBI/DHS/DEA offices at 920 N King St. However, I cannot directly test current Google info panel results. The speaker claims Google shows this address and that it appears in DOJ 1990s directories, but I found no evidence of historical FBI presence at 920 N King St. VERACITY: Mixed - the official FBI address is 500 Delaware Ave (confirmed), but the specific claim about Google's info panel showing 920 N King St could not be independently verified or refuted. Federal agencies sometimes have multiple locations in buildings not publicly listed.

**Verification Notes:** MIXED: Hepatitis B CAN be sexually transmitted (TRUE), but the claim oversimplifies why newborns are vaccinated. Newborns are at high risk because: 1) Infection can occur during birth from infected mothers (90% chance of chronic infection if infected), 2) Can be transmitted through close contact with infected household members, 3) Babies infected before age 1 have 90% chance of chronic hepatitis B. The vaccine at birth is 90% effective at preventing mother-to-child transmission. Since 1991 universal vaccination, cases in children have dropped 99%.

**Verification Notes:** The Utah Bureau of EMS lists Level I trauma centers in Utah as Intermountain Medical Center and University of Utah Hospital (not Utah Valley Hospital). Additional sources confirm Utah Valley Hospital is a Level II trauma center, contradicting the claim that it is Level I. Timpanogos Regional Hospital is confirmed as Level III via its official website. Thus, the trauma level for Timpanogos is accurate, but for UV Hospital is not. 'Less equipped' aligns with Level II being higher than Level III. 'Further' is context-dependent and unverifiable without the incident's exact location, though some social media discussions suggest varying distances based on site (e.g., closer from UVU).

**Verification Notes:** Partial truth with significant errors: (1) Name spelling: The CIA spokeswoman's name is 'Liz Lyons' (not 'Lyon'). (2) Person's name: The individual is 'Shauni Rae Kerkhoff' (not 'Shawna Rae Kirkhoff'). (3) Organization name: Liz Lyons confirmed Kerkhoff worked in 'campus security' at the CIA, not 'Capitol Protective Services'. Kerkhoff served with U.S. Capitol Police from 2018-2021 (not 2010-2015 as implied). The claim contains some factual elements (CIA spokeswoman Liz Lyons did make a statement about Kerkhoff working in security, Kerkhoff does live in Alexandria, VA) but has multiple significant inaccuracies regarding names, organization, and timeframe.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)

**Verification Notes:** Web research confirms that approximately 15-20 NAR apostles and prophets were mobilized by White House officials after the 2020 election and conducted rallies in swing states leading up to January 6. Cindy Jacobs spent nearly 3 hours at the White House on January 5, 2021. However, the specific claim about '15 pastors surrounding Trump at the White House' is not precisely documented. The meetings and White House access are confirmed, but the exact number and specific 'surrounding' scenario is partially supported rather than fully verified.

**Verification Notes:** Wikipedia confirms that Lance Wallnau attended Valley Forge Military Academy and College (supporting the graduation from a military academy) and that his father, Carl Wallnau, was an Air Force major. However, no reliable sources, including Wikipedia or other web results, mention Carl Wallnau serving under General Patton. This part of the claim appears unverifiable based on available information; verification would require access to military service records (e.g., via FOIA request to the National Archives or Department of Defense personnel files) to confirm any WWII-era service details under Patton's command.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Partially verifiable. The claim that Tyler Robinson is 'not a gun enthusiast' conflicts with evidence. Multiple sources report: (1) Robinson had photos on social media holding guns, (2) He told coworkers about a 450-yard long-range rifle shot before the shooting, (3) His family is described as 'outdoorsy and like to hunt', (4) He used a Mauser Model 98 hunting rifle known for accuracy. While he may have been less interested in hunting than his brothers and more focused on fishing, characterizing him as 'not a gun enthusiast' is contradicted by the evidence of his firearms knowledge and practice.

**Source:** [They Are Lying About Tyler Robinson. | Candace Ep 244 @ 00:04:51](/episodes/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw.md#t-00-04-51)
**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim by Candace Owens contradicts official charging documents. Per charging documents and multiple news sources (ABC, CNN, CBS), Tyler Robinson's parents recognized him from news images, convinced him to come to their home, and he allegedly confessed to them saying Kirk 'spreads too much hate.' His parents then facilitated his surrender through a retired detective. However, Owens claims via unnamed sources that parents don't believe their son is guilty and that he disputed committing the crime. The official law enforcement account directly contradicts Owens' assertion, but we cannot definitively verify what the parents privately believe versus what they facilitated through law enforcement. The claim mixes factual dispute with unverifiable internal beliefs.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** While the claim states the family was told by Feds to go into witness protection, public reports confirm witness protection concerns exist in the case. However, sources indicate 'current witness protection programs are designed primarily for federal cases involving organized crime or terrorism' and there were 'limited resources' for this case. The claim suggests the family was convinced to enter protection specifically due to speaking out risks, but this exact framing and motivation hasn't been independently confirmed in public sources. The family did cooperate with authorities to convince Tyler Robinson to surrender.

**Source:** [To My Friend, Charlie Kirk. @ 00:01:24](/episodes/ep-_dRaEO47-co.md#t-00-01-24)
**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Verification Notes:** Partially accurate. Candace Owens did meet Charlie Kirk in 2017 and was hired by him as director of urban engagement at Turning Point USA, announced on November 21, 2017 at the MAGA Rally in Rockford, Illinois. However, describing TPUSA as a 'very young organization' in 2017 is misleading - TPUSA was founded in 2012, making it 5 years old at the time they met, not 'very young.' By 2017, TPUSA had already established itself on hundreds of college campuses with significant funding and national recognition.

**Source:** [To My Friend, Charlie Kirk. @ 00:02:47](/episodes/ep-_dRaEO47-co.md#t-00-02-47)
**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Partially true but contains a factual error. Charlie Kirk DID envision Turning Point USA becoming the biggest conservative student organization globally and it achieved that goal. Multiple sources confirm TPUSA grew to be present on 3,000+ campuses and became 'the largest and fastest-growing conservative youth activist organization in America.' The claim about Kirk discussing taking control of the RNC at age 23 is supported by Candace Owens' firsthand testimony of their planning session at Chicago O'Hare Macaroni Grill. However, the claim implies this happened when Kirk was 23, but Kirk founded TPUSA in 2012 at age 18 (born Oct 14, 1993), so he would have been around age 19-20 during early planning sessions with Owens, not 23. The transcript shows Owens saying 'he's 23 years old' as clarification during her retelling, but the planning session she describes appears to be from earlier in TPUSA's history.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is a direct quote from a witness (aunt of Shaner Broderick) captured on video, so the quote itself is verifiable. Multiple sources including Gateway Pundit and other outlets confirm the video exists and contains this statement. However, the factual assertion within the quote (that there was an accomplice woman who gave the shooter items) remains unverified. The FBI is investigating potential accomplices, but neither FBI nor Utah law enforcement has confirmed seeing another person with Robinson before or after the shooting. The claim accurately represents what was said on video, but the underlying allegation is unconfirmed speculation.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The Grayzone and other outlets confirmed Bill Ackman hosted a Hamptons meeting where Kirk was confronted about Israel views, with attendees reporting it was contentious. Reports confirm Netanyahu involvement and funding offers to TPUSA which Kirk rejected. However, Ackman publicly denied making threats or blackmail attempts, publishing friendly text exchanges with Kirk. Witness accounts vary - some describe 'screaming' and Kirk feeling 'blackmailed,' others describe 'spirited but amicable' discussions. The meeting occurred and involved Israel pressure, but characterization as threatening 'intervention' with 'threats made' is disputed.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim alleges that Bill Ackman was 'very upset and threats were made' during a Hamptons meeting with Charlie Kirk. The Grayzone reported on this alleged 'intervention' in early August 2025, citing five sources with 'intimate knowledge' of the meeting. The report claims Ackman and others confronted Kirk about his Israel criticism, with one attendee saying Natasha Hausdorff was 'screaming' at Kirk, and Kirk came away concerned about 'blackmail.' However, Bill Ackman publicly denied these allegations on X, stating 'at no time have I ever threatened Charlie Kirk' and 'I have never blackmailed anyone.' The meeting itself appears to have occurred, but the characterization of 'threats' is disputed by Ackman and relies on anonymous sources. The claim is partially true (a tense meeting occurred) but unverified regarding specific threats.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Robert Maxwell's alleged connections to Israeli intelligence/Mossad are extensively documented but remain contested. Multiple sources including books, former intelligence officials like Ari Ben-Menashe, and the PROMIS software scandal allegations support intelligence ties. Maxwell received a state funeral in Israel attended by top officials and intelligence heads. However, definitive documentary proof of formal Mossad role is absent from neutral public records, and Maxwell denied the allegations before his death.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The claim that 'evidence shows' Epstein was a creation of intelligence agencies is partially supported but overstated. Documentary evidence exists of Epstein's connections to Israeli elites: Drop Site News investigations revealed Israeli intelligence officer Yoni Koren lived at Epstein's apartment for weeks (2013-2016); hacked emails from Ehud Barak show Epstein brokering Israel-Mongolia security deals and Israel-Russia backchannels. However, no public documents show formal recruitment, payment records, or operational orders. Former Mossad director Ari Ben-Menashe claimed Epstein worked for Israeli intelligence since the 1980s, but this remains unconfirmed. The evidence shows access and influence with Israeli political/intelligence figures, but not definitive proof of being 'created by' or formally employed by any intelligence agency. 'Mixed' because evidence of connections exists, but not of creation/employment.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The claim references theories about how Robinson concealed and transported the Mauser rifle. According to NBC News and other sources, the rifle was recovered intact, wrapped in a towel in bushes - not disassembled. Surveillance footage showed Robinson 'walking with an unusual gait' with 'very little bending in his right leg, consistent with a rifle being hidden in his pants.' However, evidence suggests the rifle was NOT disassembled into parts as the claim suggests. While videos online debate whether the rifle could be quickly disassembled, the FBI found the rifle intact. The '2 seconds' claim appears to be skeptical commentary, not an official explanation. The claim misrepresents what investigators actually concluded.

**Verification Notes:** This claim is partially verified. George Zinn was indeed arrested after falsely confessing to shooting Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University on September 10, 2025. Multiple sources confirm the shooting occurred 'shortly after 12:20 p.m.' and that Zinn was taken into custody after shouting 'I shot him, now shoot me.' However, the specific time of '12:52' for the custody announcement could not be independently verified through available sources.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Partially accurate but timing is off. According to multiple sources, Charlie Kirk announced setting up a DOGE-style efficiency department at TPUSA on September 2, 2025, via internal memo naming Justin Strife as COO to lead the initiative. However, Kirk died on September 10, 2025 - meaning this was 8 days before his death, not 7 days as claimed. The memo's existence and Kirk's concerns about TPUSA finances are documented in multiple news reports, though TPUSA leadership has not officially confirmed the memo's authenticity.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple sources report Laura Loomer is prohibited from gun ownership under 18 USC 922(g)(4) due to involuntary psychiatric holds under Florida's Baker Act, with FBI confirmation of the prohibition. However, these reports largely stem from claims by Milo Yiannopoulos in 2024 who has personal conflicts with Loomer, and lack mainstream media or official documentation. Loomer herself has not publicly confirmed the hospitalization details. The gun prohibition appears factual but the specific circumstances ('psychotic events requiring hospitalization') lack independent verification.

**Verification Notes:** REVIEWING TRANSCRIPT CONTEXT: The speaker claims Egyptian military men were 'on the ground' on September 10th. Evidence shows: (1) An Egyptian Air Force plane (SU-BTT) departed Provo at 7:08 AM MDT, BEFORE the shooting at 12:23 PM; (2) Candace Owens claims via whistleblower that the plane dropped off 'military subcontractors' - this is unconfirmed; (3) The plane was at Duncan Aviation for maintenance Sept 4-10; (4) No official sources confirm Egyptian military personnel were physically present on the ground. VERACITY: The Egyptian plane WAS in Provo and departed Sept 10, but left hours BEFORE the assassination, not after. The claim Egyptian military 'men' were 'on the ground' is unverified - based solely on anonymous whistleblower to Owens claiming subcontractors were dropped off. Marking as MIXED because plane presence is confirmed but personnel on ground is unverified claim.

**Verification Notes:** This is Candace's editorial/sarcastic commentary. Law enforcement DID promise swift action, and Tyler Robinson WAS arrested after a 33-hour manhunt (objectively swift by any standard). However, Candace is expressing skepticism that the investigation was 'successful' - this is her subjective opinion.

However, the specific claim of 'tens of millions in two weeks' is not directly confirmed - sources describe 'surge' and 'flood' of donations but don't specify exact amounts in first two weeks. The claim text also appears incomplete/malformed.

**Verification Notes:** The claim states Robinson's father believed the rifle matched one given to his son as a gift. Public sources confirm the rifle WAS a gift, but from Robinson's GRANDFATHER, not just generically 'given to his son as a gift.' Multiple sources (ABC News, CBS News, PBS) confirm prosecutors stated the rifle 'had been a gift from Robinson's grandfather.' The claim is partially accurate but lacks the specific detail that it was from the grandfather. The father did recognize his son from surveillance images and contacted him.

**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Verification Notes:** Verified as MIXED. The claim contains one factual error. Ben Shapiro did tweet about 'a pure form of anti-Semitism' related to Israel-first accusations, but the exact wording was different and the target was not accurately stated. The actual tweet (Dec 24, 2016) reads: 'Accusing any American Jew who is pro-Israel of being an Israel Firster is a pure form of anti-Semitism.' The claim states he accused 'any American Jew who is pro-Israel first' - the actual tweet says 'being an Israel Firster' (a different concept). Additionally, while the tweet was made in response to Nick Fuentes, it was not directly 'directed at' Fuentes but was a quote-tweet responding to his earlier statement about dual loyalty. The core elements are accurate but with meaningful differences in wording and context. Source: Ben Shapiro X/Twitter December 24, 2016.

**Source:** [Satys Aerospace expanding painting and striping operations in Delaware](https://x.com/DelawareBRT/status/1995825524510163263)
**Verification Notes:** TIMELINE ANALYSIS: Evidence shows SU-BTT (Egyptian govt Dassault Falcon 7X) visited Wilmington as early as June 2021 while Dassault facility was still operating. However, Dassault closed ~2021, leaving hangar shuttered until Satys announced takeover in Dec 2024 and opened Oct 2025. Yet SU-BTT continued visiting Wilmington during the gap years (2021-2024) when no authorized maintenance facility existed. This timing discrepancy supports the claim's suggestion that maintenance was not the primary purpose. However, Satys itself IS a legitimate aircraft finishing company, so the claim that Satys 'wasn't established to provide maintenance' is false - Satys is real. The suspicious element is the Egyptian plane's visits BEFORE Satys arrival. CLAIM INTERPRETATION: The speaker appears to conflate two issues: (1) Satys's legitimacy as a company (it IS legitimate), and (2) whether the Egyptian planes' Delaware visits were truly for maintenance (questionable given timing). Marking as MIXED because Satys is legitimate but the broader implication about suspicious activity has some evidentiary support.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Eric Bolling did appear on PBD Podcast Episode 650 and made statements about Candace Owens' relationship with Charlie Kirk. Bolling stated that Kirk and Owens 'had a break-up' and that there 'hasn't been a communication pipeline between the two for many years.' However, the characterization of this as 'lying through his teeth' is subjective. Some dispute Bolling's timeline claims, noting Owens toured for TPUSA in 2024. The claim contains factual elements (Bolling appeared on PBD and made statements about their relationship) but the 'lying' characterization represents Owens' interpretation rather than an objective fact.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Newsweek and Times Now, confirm that Candace Owens released a clear image purporting to show Tyler Robinson at a Dairy Queen in Orem at 6:38 p.m. after the shooting, matching the podcast claim. However, the image is unverified by law enforcement, and official sources have not confirmed its authenticity, timestamp, or that it depicts Robinson at that exact time. Fact-checks address related theories but do not debunk the image's existence, only specific interpretations. Verification would require official confirmation from Utah police, Dairy Queen surveillance records, or court documents via FOIA.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Operation Mockingbird was a real CIA program from the Cold War era that involved media manipulation, confirmed by Church Committee investigations in 1975-76. However, the claim that mainstream media 'has been controlled' (present tense) since then is disputed. The CIA claimed the operation ended in 1976, though debates continue. The extent of control and whether systematic manipulation continues is contested by historians.

**Source:** [Charlie Kirk Person of Interest Seen On Video Heading Toward Campus](https://www.tmz.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-possible-shooter-on-video-near-campus/)
**Verification Notes:** The claim contains an error: it says 'Charlie Kirk's assassination' when context shows the speaker meant to say 'the morning after Charlie Kirk's assassination.' The substantive claim is that TMZ publicized footage the morning after the Sept 10, 2025 shooting. TMZ did extensively cover the event and published various footage including surveillance video of the suspect. However, the specific timing claim about footage being published 'the morning after' (Sept 11) versus the day of the shooting cannot be precisely verified. TMZ's main shooting timeline article was published Sept 16, though they posted various footage earlier.

**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Verification Notes:** Edward Bernays, Sigmund Freud's nephew, is widely recognized as 'the father of public relations' and a pioneer of modern propaganda. Bernays applied Freud's theories about unconscious psychological motivations to public relations and mass persuasion. His works 'Crystallizing Public Opinion' (1923) and 'Propaganda' (1928) were foundational texts. Life magazine named him one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century. However, it was Edward Bernays specifically (not the broader 'Freud family') who created these propaganda techniques. Sigmund Freud himself was not directly involved in propaganda development.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Netanyahu confirmed he invited Kirk to Israel two weeks before his assassination (not 'a few weeks before') in a statement posted on X after Kirk's death. The claim states Kirk 'declined' but there's no clear evidence Kirk explicitly declined the invitation before his death - Netanyahu said 'Sadly, that visit will not take place' referring to Kirk's assassination. The timing and invitation are confirmed, but characterizing it as 'declined' is misleading since Kirk was killed before he could visit.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Tucker Carlson did speak at AmFest in both 2023 and 2024, which is confirmed. However, the claim that 'they said that can't happen again' requires more context. There was donor pressure - Robert Shillman, a tech billionaire, cancelled a  million pledge over Carlson's participation at a Turning Point event, and there were concerns raised about Carlson's inclusion. But evidence doesn't show an outright ban was imposed. The claim oversimplifies a more complex situation involving donor pressure rather than a categorical prohibition.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The claim states 'Shulman' demanded name removal from TPUSA building in 48 hours before assassination. The Grayzone reported that Robert Shillman (not Shulman - misspelling) cancelled plans for his name plaque at TPUSA and terminated funding. However, Shillman announced this at an AFA dinner on Sept 6, 2025 - which is 4 days (not 48 hours) before Kirk's Sept 10 assassination. The core facts are substantially true but details are imprecise: wrong name spelling and wrong timeframe.

**Source:** [Anti-Defamation League - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League)
**Verification Notes:** The ADL was indeed founded by B'nai B'rith in 1913. However, calling B'nai B'rith a 'Freemason organization' is misleading. B'nai B'rith was founded in 1843 as an independent Jewish fraternal organization. While some founders were Freemasons and it adopted Masonic-style rituals (secret degrees, signs), it was always a separate Jewish organization, not a Masonic one. It's more accurate to say B'nai B'rith was modeled after or influenced by Freemasonry.

**Verification Notes:** Mixed accuracy: The ADL was indeed founded in 1913 by B'nai B'rith in response to the Leo Frank case. However, the characterization is misleading. Leo Frank was convicted of murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan, but historians today generally consider him to have been wrongly convicted due to antisemitism. The claim he was a 'pedophile' is inflammatory and not supported by historical evidence - he was accused of murder, not sexual assault of a child. The ADL was founded to combat antisemitism after what Jewish leaders viewed as a wrongful prosecution driven by prejudice. Frank was later pardoned in 1986.

**Verification Notes:** MIXED ACCURACY: The Bracebridge Complex does exist at 1100 North King Street in Wilmington, Delaware (not Baltimore as initially searched). It does span over 1 million square feet. However, key details are incorrect: (1) It was built for MBNA (not 'Maryland Bank') as headquarters from 1995 until Bank of America acquired MBNA in 2006. (2) The 2018 timeline is correct - Bank of America did vacate buildings in 2018. (3) Macron became French President in 2017, not 2018.

**Source:** [TX Pastor Arrested on Child Porn Charges, Removed by Church Board](https://julieroys.com/houston-area-pastor-hollen-arrested-child-porn-charges-removed-church-board/)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including news outlets like The Roys Report and MinistryWatch, confirm that Bruce Hollen, lead pastor of Calvary Chapel of the Woodlands, was arrested in May 2024 on charges related to possession of child pornography (a form of online sex abuse against children) and later sentenced to prison. However, no sources describe the arrest as resulting from a 'sting operation'; it appears to have stemmed from a standard investigation into child pornography possession, making that specific detail inaccurate.

**Verification Notes:** I found extensive documentation of Governor Cox's press conferences on September 11 and 12, 2025 regarding the Charlie Kirk shooting. The timeline shows George Zinn was detained (not the actual shooter), and a second person of interest (Zachariah Qureshi) was briefly detained and released. However, I could not find specific documentation of a '5:30 p.m. press conference' or Cox mentioning a 'second suspect wearing all dark clothing' at the 12-minute mark. The documented press conferences were on Sept 11 (various times) and Sept 12 (when Tyler Robinson was announced as the actual suspect). The specific timing and description claimed cannot be verified from available sources.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim reports insider sources at Turning Point USA discussing Charlie Kirk's concerns about money flows. While extensive reporting confirms TPUSA had 5M in revenue, financial controversies, and donor transparency issues (donor-advised funds obscuring sources), there is no independent verification of the specific internal sources or conversations described. The claim is a report of what unnamed sources allegedly said, making it unverifiable without access to those sources. However, the broader context of financial scrutiny at TPUSA is well-documented.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including Wikipedia, CNN, ABC News, or other major outlets, confirm or deny the existence of video footage showing Tyler Robinson firing the weapon or taking aim at Charlie Kirk. Reports detail CCTV footage of Robinson before and after the incident, but not the act itself. The case is ongoing with a trial scheduled for 2026, and detailed evidence (such as potential surveillance videos) has not been publicly disclosed. Verification would require access to court documents, prosecution evidence lists, official police reports, or FOIA requests to the FBI or Utah authorities for any non-public video evidence.

**Verification Notes:** No direct confirmation found. Charlie Kirk was taken to Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem, Utah after being shot and pronounced dead there. FBI, ATF, and Utah Dept of Public Safety conducted extensive investigation including collection of security footage from multiple sources (UVU campus cameras, homeowner surveillance). However, no public reporting specifically confirms that federal agents 'immediately seized' footage at Timpanogos Hospital itself, though federal agencies were actively involved in evidence collection throughout the investigation.

**Verification Notes:** This claim makes a specific assertion about the distance (3-4 hours) between a campus and a residence shared by Tyler and Lance. The context suggests this relates to an investigation involving Tyler Robinson and UVU (Utah Valley University). To verify this claim would require: (1) knowing the exact address of Tyler and Lance's shared residence, (2) confirming the campus location being referenced, and (3) calculating actual travel time. This specific residential address information is not publicly available, and even if the campus is UVU in Orem, Utah, the claim cannot be verified without the residential address. Such specific details about individuals involved in criminal investigations are protected information.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** No public documentation found confirming FBI release of 'Lance' or drop-off at parents' home. Wikipedia, FBI press releases, and news coverage of the Charlie Kirk assassination identify Tyler Robinson as the suspect, with no mention of a person named 'Lance' being questioned, detained, or released. The claim appears to reference unverified or private information not corroborated by official sources.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is based on information from an unnamed confidential source ('my source is saying') about what Tyler Robinson was wearing when arrested. This is hearsay from an anonymous source and cannot be independently verified. The speaker is relaying second-hand information from a source they cannot publicly identify. Without access to arrest records, booking photos, or official police documentation, and without knowing the identity or credibility of the source, this claim remains unverifiable.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim about Lance Twiggs' family thinking something is 'odd' cannot be independently verified. While multiple news sources confirm Lance Twiggs was Tyler Robinson's roommate and alleged partner, and that a family member spoke to media calling Lance the 'black sheep' of the family and expressing devastation over Kirk's murder, there are no public statements from Twiggs' family specifically stating they found the federal investigation 'odd' or expressing suspicions about how Lance was handled by authorities. The claim is based on what the speaker says the family told them privately.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim presents very specific transponder data for an alleged Egyptian military plane (SU-BND) on September 10, 2025. Web search confirms Candace Owens promoted conspiracy theories about Egyptian planes (SU-BND and SU-BTT) being connected to Kirk's assassination. However, her claims were debunked - she confused UTC time with local Utah time, and one plane departed Provo at 7 a.m., hours before the shooting. Law enforcement sources told news outlets there is no evidence of foreign involvement. The specific transponder times cited in this claim come from Owens' analysis of flight tracking data, but her methodology was flawed and her conclusions were rejected by fact-checkers.

However, specific flight history for September 10, 2024 (Scottsdale to Provo at 10:06am, Provo to Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara to Scottsdale at 11:37am landing 12:44pm) cannot be verified through publicly available sources.

**Verification Notes:** This is Candace's claim about information she obtained from sources ('I learned that...I actually have the license plate numbers'). Without access to her source materials or independent verification of Duncan Aviation's rental car records, this cannot be verified through public information. The claim involves specific operational details (rental cars for 'Egyptians,' four license plates) that would require access to private business records or law enforcement investigation files to confirm.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim describes a private conversation between Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk (who is deceased) about Nick Fuentes. There are no public records, recordings, or independent witnesses that could verify this private conversation. The claim is inherently unverifiable as it relies solely on the speaker's personal recollection of a private discussion. Andrew Kolvet is mentioned as someone who could confirm parts of the account, but that doesn't make the specific claim about what Charlie did or didn't say verifiable through independent sources.

**Source:** [MATRIX REVELATIONS: Erika Kirk Speaks. Zionists Lie About... @ 00:08:39](/episodes/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU.md#t-00-08-39)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** Unverifiable. This is a personal claim by Candace Owens about private conversations she had with Charlie Kirk and Andrew Kolvet regarding hosting Nick Fuentes. Andrew Kolvet is confirmed to be a real spokesperson/executive at Turning Point USA who continues to work there after Kirk's death. While the existence of tensions between Kirk/TPUSA and Nick Fuentes is well-documented (the 2019 'Groyper Wars'), there is no independent verification of these specific private conversations. Only the parties involved could confirm or deny these discussions occurred.

**Source:** [MATRIX REVELATIONS: Erika Kirk Speaks. Zionists Lie About... @ 00:14:52](/episodes/ep-K1tFD7FfoCU.md#t-00-14-52)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** While Candace Owens alleges she has 80-150 text messages showing conflict between Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro during TPUSA's early days, no independent verification of these specific claims exists in public sources. Web searches found no corroboration of the alleged messages or specific instances of Shapiro working to hinder TPUSA. Public record shows Shapiro and Kirk had a 13-year relationship starting when Kirk was 18, and Shapiro praised Kirk's potential. IMDB references allegations about Shapiro trying to 'kill' careers, though context is unclear. Without access to the actual text messages or independent confirmation, this remains unverifiable.

**Verification Notes:** This is a hearsay claim about a private conversation between Ben Shapiro and Charlie Kirk. The speaker claims to have text messages from Charlie Kirk describing this conversation, but these have not been publicly released or independently verified. The Joe Rogan appearance and 'hall monitor' comment are mentioned but not independently verified in public sources. Without access to the referenced text messages or corroboration from the other parties involved, this claim cannot be verified.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** Owens claims she contacted a witness who filmed video of the Charlie Kirk shooter and that the witness said neither federal nor local police had contacted him. However, this is an unverified secondhand account. Multiple sources confirm that FBI and local authorities conducted extensive witness interviews after the assassination. News reports indicate 'thousands of students' were present and prosecutors noted the process to identify witnesses could be laborious. Without identifying the specific witness or independent confirmation, this claim cannot be verified.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is based on a single source (the person Owens contacted who filmed footage). While there were documented communication failures between Secret Service and local police at the Butler rally, this specific claim about a witness who filmed the shooter on the roof not being contacted by FBI or local police cannot be independently verified through public reporting. The claim remains unverifiable without access to FBI investigative records or confirmation from the witness.

**Verification Notes:** This claim states that 'the feds' never reached out to an unnamed individual until September 15th, after Governor Cox said the investigation was over. The claim is based on what this unnamed person allegedly told the speaker. Without identifying who this person is, and without access to FBI investigation records or official timelines, this cannot be independently verified. While the broader context about FBI investigation timing issues has been publicly discussed, this specific claim about when the feds contacted this particular individual relies on secondhand testimony about private communications with law enforcement.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)

This is a secondhand claim about Kirk's internal state of mind, sourced from anonymous insiders, and cannot be independently verified through public records.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This is a negative claim by Candace Owens about what has not happened (FBI not reaching out to her). While Owens stated on December 5, 2025, that 'There has been no communication with the FBI,' this is her personal testimony about her own experiences. We cannot independently verify whether private communications did or did not occur between Owens and the FBI. The FBI would not publicly confirm or deny contact with individuals in ongoing investigations. This remains a claim about personal experience that cannot be externally verified.

**Verification Notes:** This claim references reports about Charlie Kirk not being buried. While there are indeed viral reports and speculation about Kirk's burial site (FindAGrave lists it as 'Burial Details Unknown'), these are unconfirmed reports rather than established facts. The claim itself is about the existence of these reports going viral, which is true, but the underlying assertion (that he hasn't been buried) cannot be verified as the family has not disclosed the burial location.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, The Guardian, ABC News, BBC, and FBI releases, detail the shooting event, footage availability, security aspects, and timeline, but none directly address whether immediate first aid was administered by the security team, such as applying gauze or pressure to the wound. The widow's thanks to first responders in BBC reporting implies some response occurred, but this likely refers to emergency services rather than immediate security actions. To verify, access to the full multi-angle footage (as referenced in sources like The Guardian and ABC News visual timeline) or official incident reports from UVU security, first responders, or autopsy details would be required; these could be obtained via FOIA requests to the FBI or local authorities.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official FBI statements, Utah government documents, or established news outlets (e.g., ABC News, The New York Times, BBC), confirm or refute the specific claim of FBI exerting pressure on Utah authorities to declare the Charlie Kirk assassination case closed as a lone gunman incident. Web searches and X posts reveal official narratives describing the suspect Tyler James Robinson as acting alone, with FBI collaboration in the investigation, but only unsubstantiated conspiracy theories on X suggest cover-ups or undue influence. Verification would require internal communications, such as leaked emails, FOIA-requested FBI or Utah state documents, or whistleblower testimony from involved authorities to confirm any pressure.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** No public sources confirm FBI pressure on Utah authorities to close the Charlie Kirk case or rule it a lone gunman killing. Official sources confirm Tyler Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The FBI investigated and Robinson turned himself in. While FBI Director Kash Patel faced criticism for his handling of the case (including a premature social media post), there is no publicly available evidence of FBI pressure to close the case prematurely or declare it a lone gunman scenario. This claim appears to be based on unnamed 'authoritative sources' not verifiable through public records. Sources: FBI.gov press releases, Wikipedia, NBC News, CNN, CBS News coverage of the assassination.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim attributes a specific quote to FBI communications with Utah authorities. No credible news sources or official statements confirm the FBI made this specific statement. While FBI Director Kash Patel did face criticism for his handling of the investigation and had heated exchanges with Salt Lake City SAC Robert Bohls, there is no documented evidence of the FBI telling Utah authorities to close the case to avoid jeopardizing the Tyler Robinson prosecution. This appears to be speculation or an unverified insider claim.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This is a negative claim asserting the absence of video evidence showing Tyler Robinson firing a weapon or taking aim at Charlie Kirk. While this may be factually accurate as a statement about what video evidence exists publicly, it cannot be definitively verified because: (1) law enforcement may have video evidence not released publicly, (2) absence of public video doesn't mean it doesn't exist, and (3) this relates to an ongoing investigation where complete evidence is not publicly available.

**Source:** [Charlie Kirk shooting suspect referenced fascism and memes on bullets, officials say](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/charlie-kirk-shooting-suspect-fascism-memes-bullets-tyler-robinson-rcna230950)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official forensic reports, court documents, or statements from law enforcement, were found detailing the condition of the bullet or any ballistic matching to Tyler Robinson's rifle. Available news articles discuss the suspect and ammunition but do not address bullet fragmentation or matching. Social media posts on X mention conflicting claims (e.g., some alleging a match, others questioning evidence), but these are not conclusive. Verification would require access to autopsy reports, ballistic analysis from the FBI or ATF, or court filings from the ongoing case, potentially obtainable via FOIA requests or trial proceedings.

**Verification Notes:** Candace Owens claims to have an 80-page document about Thomas Matthew Crooks' online accounts and statements. While Crooks did attempt to assassinate Donald Trump on July 13, 2024, there is no way to verify whether Owens actually possesses such a document. The FBI conducted an extensive investigation of Crooks, but Owens' claim about having scraped his data before the feds removed it cannot be independently confirmed.

**Source:** [BREAKING NEWS: FBI Pressuring Utah To Close The Charlie K... @ 00:27:09](/episodes/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw.md#t-00-27-09)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** The claim alleges federal government misconduct regarding Charlie Kirk's assassination similar to JFK's assassination. Charlie Kirk was indeed assassinated on September 10, 2025 at Utah Valley University, and the shooter Tyler James Robinson was arrested. However, the claim's allegations about federal obstruction, journalist manipulation, and lying to the public are subjective interpretations that cannot be objectively verified. These are assertions about government intent and covert actions that lack publicly available evidence.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** Web searches confirm Rob McCoy has connections to Coronado (he was born and raised there) and multiple sources mention he owns a home in Coronado near San Diego. However, no public real estate records or listings were found confirming a specific sale listing on August 24, 2025. Real estate listing data may not be fully indexed or publicly accessible.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** Utah has Special Event Medical Guidelines that require medical plans for events meeting permit thresholds, but no specific statute requiring ambulance standby was found. Utah law addresses ambulance licensing (§26B-4-119) and ground ambulance rates, but search did not reveal a specific law mandating ambulance presence at all university public events. The claim is too specific to verify without access to complete Utah administrative codes and local ordinances applicable to UVU events.

**Source:** [Why Isn't The Trump Family Asking Questions About Charlie... @ 00:05:10](/episodes/ep-Qt0VHV-POCg.md#t-00-05-10)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The claim alleges that a Wikipedia citation dated November 24, 2024 for Rob McCoy's co-founder status doesn't actually support the claim in the source article. Without access to: (1) Wikipedia's detailed edit history showing the specific citation #54 added on September 11, 2025, and (2) the actual article dated November 24, 2024 that was cited, this cannot be independently verified. However, the core fact that Rob McCoy co-founded TPUSA Faith is CONFIRMED by multiple reliable sources including the official TPUSA Faith website and news reports. The issue being raised is about citation accuracy and timing of Wikipedia edits, not about whether McCoy is actually co-founder. This is a claim about Wikipedia editorial practices that would require access to Wikipedia's version history and the specific source article to verify. Sources: TPUSA Faith website confirms co-founder status; Wikipedia edit history not accessible via web search.

**Verification Notes:** This claim refers to specific Wikipedia citation dates for a Rob McCoy entry.

**Verification Notes:** Cannot verify the specific claim about who initially shared viral videos. Search results show videos spread widely across platforms (X, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube) and were viewed by millions, but no sources identify the original sharers or document their ties to government or TPUSA. The PBS and NPR coverage discusses how the videos spread but not who first shared them.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** While Erika Kirk (Charlie Kirk's widow) stated in a New York Times interview that Charlie was not wearing a bulletproof vest at the time of the shooting, this contradicts claims from Megyn Kelly and widespread online speculation based on video evidence showing bulging under his shirt. The claim cannot be definitively verified as there is no official forensic or law enforcement confirmation either way, and conflicting accounts exist from people close to the situation.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim alleges that the person who posted/shared the viral photo of George Zinn in handcuffs was someone from Utah who advertises with Turning Point USA. While George Zinn was indeed arrested and photos/videos of him in handcuffs went viral on social media after the Charlie Kirk shooting, extensive searches found no publicly available information identifying who originally took or first posted this specific photo, nor any connection to a Utah-based Turning Point USA advertiser. News sources report the images 'spread rapidly on social media' and 'circulated online' without attribution to an original source. Without access to the speaker's research or the specific individual being referenced, this claim cannot be independently verified.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This is a direct quote from Charlie Kirk about his own behavior and principles, not a factual claim that can be independently verified. It's a statement of personal values and intentions ('I don't stop being friends with people just because people morally blackmail me'). While the quote itself is verifiable as something Kirk said (recorded on video in August 2025), the claim about his actual behavior and motivations is a personal statement that cannot be objectively verified through external evidence.

**Verification Notes:** Cannot independently verify through public sources. No search results found for 'Gernot Omer' associated with BearingPoint, JPMorgan Chase, Utah, or the specific timeline mentioned (moved to Utah in May 2024). LinkedIn searches returned no matching profiles. The claim involves specific personal identification details (blog posts in German, YouTube videos, LinkedIn profile, employment details) that appear to be from private investigative research. Without access to the source materials referenced (German blog post, BearingPoint video, LinkedIn profile), this cannot be independently verified through public web sources.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is about a specific individual's employment history. While JPMorgan Chase has extensive software engineering positions and the timeline is plausible, no public records confirm this specific person's move to Utah or employment at JPMorgan Chase in May 2024. LinkedIn profiles and employment records for private individuals are not publicly verifiable through web search, and the person's identity (Gernot from Austria) appears to be based on podcast investigation rather than official sources. Without access to employment verification or the individual's own public statements, this remains unverifiable.

**Verification Notes:** This claim is part of Candace Owens' unverified conspiracy theory about Egyptian military planes tracking Charlie Kirk. According to Yahoo News, Sportskeeda, and FactCheck.co reporting, Owens made claims about Egyptian military aircraft but provided no verifiable evidence. No official law enforcement, government agency, or independent verification confirms the passenger count claims. Aviation analysts note Egyptian military planes fly internationally for routine logistics but dismiss unverified ties to Kirk's assassination. The specific passenger count claim cannot be independently verified through reliable sources.

**Source:** [INFILTRATION: Charlie Kirk Was Being Tracked For Years. |... @ 00:09:50](/episodes/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0.md#t-00-09-50)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim makes highly specific assertions about Egyptian aircraft SU-BND: that it flew into St. Louis, Missouri on February 21st, 2023, landed at 2:38 p.m., and remained there until May 2023. While SU-BND is confirmed to exist as an Egyptian-registered Gulfstream 4SP in aviation databases (FlightAware and Flightradar24), verifying the specific flight details from February 2023 requires access to historical flight tracking data that is not freely available in web searches. Flight tracking services like FlightAware maintain historical records, but accessing data from nearly 2 years ago (February 2023) typically requires premium access or specialized data requests. Additionally, government or military aircraft may have limited or restricted tracking data. Without access to comprehensive historical flight records for this specific tail number, date, time, and multi-month stay duration, these precise claims cannot be independently verified through public sources.

**Verification Notes:** This claim references specific flight tracking data for an Egyptian plane (SUBTT/BTT) flying from Cairo through Paris to St. Louis on February 25, 2023. This is part of a larger narrative about surveillance activities. Without access to specialized flight tracking databases or official records, it is not possible to verify the specific flight path, registration, and timing of this aircraft. Flight tracking data for private or government aircraft from 2023 is not readily available through public sources.

**Verification Notes:** This claim relies on anonymous sources within Turning Point's faith department. Web research confirms Lance Wallnau's connection to TPUSA Faith, his involvement with Rob McCoy (co-founder of TPUSA Faith), and his promotion of the Seven Mountains Mandate that influenced Charlie Kirk. However, the specific financial claims about Wallnau funding TPUSA Faith operations cannot be verified through public sources. TPUSA Faith had a budget of 6.4 million dollars (2021), but donor breakdowns are not publicly available. The claim about private funding amounts is unverifiable without internal documents or financial disclosures.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim alleges that Lance Wallnau was 'privately directing large sums of money into Turning Point USA Faith.' While Rolling Stone and other sources confirm Wallnau collaborated with Charlie Kirk and TPUSA Faith publicly, and TPUSA Faith had a .4M budget in 2021, no public sources verify the specific claim about Wallnau 'privately directing large sums' into TPUSA Faith. The speaker cites 'sources within Turning Point's faith department' but this cannot be independently verified. Wallnau's public role and partnership is confirmed, but the private funding claim remains unverified.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim states that one of four people on an Egyptian plane flight was 'a foreign dignitary' but provides no verifiable details about who this person was, what government they represented, or independent confirmation of their status.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** Cannot independently verify through public sources. The claim appears in search results only as part of Candace Owens' own reporting about her investigation. Third-party sources reference her claims about 'Walid Mahmood' as a passenger name, but no independent verification from aviation authorities, law enforcement, or official government sources could be found. The claim involves private travel manifests and potentially classified information that would not be publicly available. This is investigative journalism that cannot be fact-checked through open sources.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim refers to transponder data for a specific flight of an Egyptian military plane (tail number SUBTU) carrying someone named Walid Mahmood to Provo, Utah on May 27, 2019. While flight tracking websites like FlightAware and ADS-B Exchange do track aircraft with tail number SU-BTT/SUBTT, publicly available sources do not contain specific transponder data for this particular May 2019 flight. The absence of transponder data could mean: (1) the transponder was turned off, (2) the flight occurred but wasn't tracked publicly, (3) the data has been removed, or (4) the flight didn't occur as described. Without access to proprietary aviation databases or official investigation records, this specific claim about missing transponder data for this particular historical flight cannot be independently verified.

**Verification Notes:** The claim states President al-Sisi can be ruled out from being in Provo in May 2023 because he was photographed in Egypt that week. While al-Sisi's general whereabouts may be trackable through official records, I could not locate specific photographic evidence of al-Sisi in Egypt during the specific week referenced in May 2023.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This is a conspiracy allegation about TPUSA coordinating with federal authorities to suppress information. Such claims about secret coordination between private organizations and government agencies to 'bury' stories are inherently unverifiable without insider access to private communications or documented evidence of such coordination. No public records or reliable sources can confirm or deny private institutional intentions or covert collaborations.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This appears to be a conversational aside directed at someone named 'Project Constitution' in the chat about plane tail numbers (BTU vs BTT). Without access to the specific chat messages or knowing what planes are being referenced, this cannot be independently verified.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** Unverifiable: This claim is about Charlie Kirk's subjective emotional state and internal thought processes ('authentically angry', 'recognizing how much control was around him'). No objective evidence can verify someone's internal emotional authenticity or their specific realizations. This is Candace Owens' interpretation of Kirk's state of mind, not a verifiable factual claim. Tucker Carlson did state that Kirk 'was appalled by what was happening in Gaza' and 'did not like Bibi Netanyahu', which suggests some level of questioning, but the specific characterization of authentic anger and recognition of control remains a subjective interpretation.

**Source:** [They Are Lying About Tyler Robinson. | Candace Ep 244 @ 00:02:27](/episodes/ep-ZGxnf5cj4Uw.md#t-00-02-27)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is based on what Candace Owens reports being told by an unnamed source about Tyler Robinson's reaction. The charging documents confirm Robinson did carve messages on casings and texted his roommate that the engravings were 'mostly a big meme' and joked about seeing 'notices bulge OwO' on Fox News. However, there is no public evidence about Robinson being specifically 'bewildered' by the idea he carved them. The source of this characterization (Candace's unnamed source) cannot be independently verified.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** Unverifiable allegation. This claim represents what Tyler Robinson's family believes happened after his arrest - specifically that a 'furry bed' was placed in his room to frame him. While multiple news sources report that Candace Owens made these claims about the family's beliefs (AOL, X/Twitter posts), there is no independent evidence to verify whether the apartment was actually staged. Prosecutors have dismissed staging theories as 'baseless' and state they have 'substantial' evidence of Robinson's guilt. This is an unverified family allegation reported in media, not an established fact.

**Verification Notes:** The claim references a social media post showing Mike Mitchell's retirement celebration. While there are LinkedIn profiles and employment records for individuals named Mike Mitchell in various Washington County locations, there is no publicly available news article or official announcement confirming a Washington County, Utah detective named Mike Mitchell retiring in January 2024.

**Verification Notes:** Cannot verify this claim about a specific individual (referred to as 'Nick') working on Phil Lyman's 2024 gubernatorial campaign. While Phil Lyman did run for Utah Governor in 2024 against Spencer Cox (and lost in the Republican primary), public campaign staff records do not list campaign workers by name.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This is a personal anecdote from Candace Owens about her first planning session with Charlie Kirk at a Macaroni Grill restaurant in Chicago O'Hare airport. Such personal meetings are not typically documented in public records or verifiable through independent sources. The claim is specific and detailed (location, restaurant name), but without corroborating evidence from other witnesses or documentation, it cannot be independently verified.

**Verification Notes:** Unverifiable: This is Candace Owens recounting a private conversation with Charlie Kirk from many years earlier (when he was 23) where he allegedly discussed future plans to 'take control of the RNC'. While Kirk did become influential within Republican circles and his Turning Point USA partnered with the RNC in 2024, there is no way to verify what was said in this private conversation at a Macaroni Grill at Chicago O'Hare. Kirk did speak at the 2024 RNC and had close relationships with Trump campaign officials, but whether he specifically stated he would 'take control of the RNC' in this early conversation cannot be independently confirmed. Sources: Washington Post, National Memo, CBS News on Kirk's 2024 RNC involvement.

> Two years later, the decomposing body of a Las Vegas prostitute was found stuffed in the air conditioner of a seedy motel. She was killed by three hired hands... the money traced back to the DuPont family... It appeared that Lisa Dean, who is a DuPont, didn't approve of her drug-addicted son dating a drug-addicted Vegas sex worker. So she and her husband, Christopher Mosley, had her killed. Both John DuPont and Mosley died in prison.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim reports that unnamed sources ('mommy sleuths and daddy sleuths' and 'young women') told Candace Owens about a French-American donor named Pierre, which she later connected to Pierre du Pont. While the du Pont family is indeed a prominent French-American family with a history of philanthropy, fact-checking sources found no verified evidence of any Pierre DuPont being a TPUSA donor. The claim is based entirely on anonymous sources whose statements cannot be independently verified, and no public records or reporting confirm this alleged donor relationship.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is a subjective statement about Charlie Kirk's intentions and mental state ('he knew he was going to die,' 'he felt...he had to take that option'). These are inherently unverifiable personal interpretations and cannot be fact-checked through external sources. The claim represents Candace Owens' personal understanding of Charlie Kirk's motivations based on their private conversations.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is a subjective statement about personal experience with lawfare rather than a verifiable factual assertion. The speaker is describing their belief that they are being subjected to constant lawsuits as a strategy. While lawfare as a tactic exists and is documented, whether this specific individual is being targeted in this way is a matter of personal experience and interpretation, not an independently verifiable fact.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This is a subjective opinion/commentary claim about whether Turning Point has provided 'clear answers' and whether people 'attacking Candace' are 'reporting to be Christians.' These are characterizations of interactions and motivations that cannot be objectively verified. The claim represents the speaker's interpretation of events and other people's statements/actions, not a factual assertion that can be independently verified as true or false.

**Verification Notes:** This is a subjective opinion/belief statement rather than a verifiable factual claim.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** Unverifiable personal recollection. This is Candace Owens' personal statement about recognizing someone from footage of the Charlie Kirk shooting - someone she says worked at Turning Point USA in early days when she was there. This is a subjective personal memory claim about her own employment history and acquaintances. There is no way to independently verify her personal memories of knowing this individual from years ago at Turning Point USA. While factual in the sense that it describes her recollection, it cannot be objectively verified through external sources.

**Source:** [How the Charlie Kirk shooting unfolded – in maps, videos and images | Charlie Kirk shooting | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images)
**Verification Notes:** The claim recounts a private conversation where an unnamed individual describes their position next to Charlie Kirk during the shooting and their immediate assessment of his condition. While news sources like The Guardian provide visual timelines, maps, and videos of the incident, they do not identify specific individuals seated to Kirk's left or confirm actions like securing footage. Social media posts discuss footage and suspicions about people near Kirk, but these are not reliable primary sources. Verification would require the individual's identity, access to unedited event footage for position confirmation, and possibly call records or statements from Candace Owens or the individual to substantiate the conversation.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official statements from TPUSA, the FBI, or investigative reports, confirm or refute that a specific individual secured and handed over footage to federal authorities following Charlie Kirk's shooting. News articles discuss Owens' claims about unreleased FBI-held video related to the incident, but do not verify the specific conversation or action described. Verification would require access to FBI investigative records, TPUSA internal communications, or court documents from the ongoing investigation, potentially obtainable via FOIA request.

**Verification Notes:** This is Candace Owens reporting what an individual told her about why they took down a camera at the scene where Charlie Kirk was shot. This is hearsay - we cannot verify what this person's actual intentions were when they took down the camera. Owens is accurately representing what she says the person told her, but the underlying claim about the person's motivations and actions cannot be independently verified.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources, including Soap Central and Times of India, report Candace Owens' claim that she viewed private footage from behind Charlie Kirk showing no blood or gore. However, the footage has not been publicly released, and no independent verification from official sources (e.g., forensic reports or law enforcement) confirms or refutes what it depicts. Verification would require public release of the footage, an official autopsy report detailing wound ballistics, or FOIA-requested documents from the FBI or local authorities investigating the September 10, 2025, shooting.

**Verification Notes:** Owens' claim about being told she couldn't speak at AmFest due to donor threats is unverifiable. Public reporting confirms Owens was excluded from Kirk memorial events and there was significant controversy between Owens and TPUSA leadership over her allegations about pro-Israel donor pressure on Kirk. However, no independent documentation confirms the specific claim about AmFest speaking ban or explicit donor threats. TPUSA disputes Owens' broader allegations.

**Verification Notes:** This claim references a private message exchange between Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk dated May 22, 2025. While Owens states she has these messages and has shown them on her show, there is no independent way to verify the existence, authenticity, or exact content of private messages between individuals. The claim is inherently unverifiable without access to the original messages or third-party confirmation.

I was told that the White House stepped in and put in a personal phone call to the event coordinator. And they actually did already have an event that was scheduled. And the White House simply asked those people if they would be willing to move or reschedule their event. It was apparently supposed to be an RV show.

The speaker claims to have shown this in the episode. To fully verify, one would need to check archive.org directly for the specific snapshot date.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim about Kash Patel installing Robert Bowles at the 'State Bureau' whose 'first case is Charlie Kirk's assassination' cannot be verified. While Charlie Kirk's assassination did occur on September 10, 2025, the specific claims about: (1) Kash Patel 'cleaning house' at an entity called the 'State Bureau,' (2) installing someone named Robert Bowles with 'long tenure in DC,' and (3) this being Bowles' first case - are not corroborated by available sources about the Kirk assassination investigation. The investigation appears to have been handled by local Utah authorities and the FBI. The suspect Tyler Robinson surrendered the next day after his parents recognized him from released photos. No public sources mention Kash Patel's involvement or a person named Robert Bowles leading the investigation. Sources: Wikipedia, NBC News, PBS, Britannica (Assassination of Charlie Kirk)

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim asserts that Charlie Kirk was attending Catholic mass before his death. This is a personal religious practice claim that cannot be independently verified through public sources. While Candace Owens states this as fact based on her personal knowledge, there are no public records, photographs, witness testimonies, or other independent verification of Kirk's private religious practices. The claim is inherently unverifiable without access to personal witnesses or Kirk's private life documentation.

**Verification Notes:** This claim is inherently unverifiable as it makes assertions about Charlie Kirk's internal feelings and subjective experiences ('change of heart', 'felt...blackmailed'). These are personal mental/emotional states that cannot be objectively confirmed through external sources. While someone may have claimed Charlie felt this way, his actual feelings and subjective experience cannot be independently verified.

**Verification Notes:** This is a subjective/qualitative assessment of Charlie Kirk's impact and legacy.

**Verification Notes:** This claim references alleged text messages from Charlie Kirk sent the day before his death saying 'they are going to kill me tomorrow.'

However, no law enforcement agency, verified insider, or Turning Point USA has publicly confirmed the existence of these messages. The claim remains unverified and unsupported by official sources or evidence presented in court proceedings.

**Verification Notes:** This is a speculative prediction, not a factual claim about something that has already occurred. The speaker states 'I will guarantee you' and 'I'm very close to figuring out' which are future-oriented assertions. Without the speaker providing evidence of which military unit allegedly wore maroon shirts, and without independent corroboration of military presence, this remains pure speculation. The claim structure itself makes it inherently unverifiable as presented.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** The Brigitte Macron lawsuit is confirmed to exist - it was filed in Delaware Superior Court in July 2025 by the law firm Clare Locke. Multiple news sources confirm this is 'an immensely costly legal battle' with Clare Locke having previously won 87.5M from Fox News. However, the specific figure of 'over a quarter of a million dollars' in legal costs cannot be independently verified as Owens' legal expenses are private financial information. The lawsuit has not yet had its first day in court as of the claim date, which is accurate.

**Source:** [BREAKING: TPUSA Throws Down The Gauntlet! Publicly Invite... @ 00:49:54](/episodes/ep-his-JBjlkh8.md#t-00-49-54)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Source:** [N/A](N/A)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets, official government statements, or Macron's public calendar documents, were found confirming a phone call between Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron on September 10, 2025, at 6:45 p.m. French time (10:45 a.m. Utah time). Posts on X mention this detail and reference public records, but X posts are not conclusive evidence and may contain unverified claims. Additionally, the exact time of Charlie Kirk's assassination is not detailed in reliable sources, making the '1.5 hours before' aspect impossible to confirm. Verification would require access to Emmanuel Macron's official public calendar for September 10, 2025, or FOIA-requested records from French or U.S. government sources documenting the call, as well as precise timestamps from police reports or news archives on the assassination timing.

**Verification Notes:** This is a speculative opinion statement ('I feel like there is definitely something military that happened') rather than a factual claim that can be verified. The speaker is expressing a personal belief about Charlie Kirk's assassination, not making a verifiable factual assertion. There is no public evidence or investigation findings available to confirm or refute military involvement in the incident.

**Source:** [BREAKING NEWS! The Egyptian Military Was In Provo On 9/10... @ 00:01:57](/episodes/ep-iHav0PPzUz8.md#t-00-01-57)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** This claim references a military-contracted plane allegedly dipping to 300 feet over Provo airport at 9:16 AM on September 10, 2025 (the day Charlie Kirk was assassinated). Web searches found extensive discussion of planes near Provo that day, including a private Bombardier Challenger 300 (N888KG) that departed Provo Airport around 1:11 PM, and allegations by Candace Owens about Egyptian military planes. However, no credible sources confirm the specific details about a military-contracted plane from Biggs Army Airfield making a 300-foot dip at 9:16 AM. The '300' in some references appears to be the aircraft model (Bombardier Challenger 300), not altitude. This specific claim cannot be verified through available sources.

**Verification Notes:** Candace Owens claims that airport personnel had been instructed to lie about the Egyptian plane. This is an unverifiable allegation based on unnamed sources. No airport personnel have come forward publicly, no official statements from Provo Municipal Airport address this claim, and no law enforcement investigation has confirmed federal instruction to lie to the public. This claim appears in Owens' commentary but lacks any documentary evidence, corroboration from identified witnesses, or official confirmation. Cannot be verified or falsified with available public information.

**Verification Notes:** Unverifiable. While it is confirmed that Egyptian Air Force aircraft SU-BTT (Dassault Falcon 7X) arrived at Provo on September 4, 2025 for scheduled maintenance at Duncan Aviation and departed on September 10, 2025, the specific claim about it only visiting the U.S. twice in the past year, both times in weeks leading up to Kirk's assassination, cannot be verified from available sources. Flight tracking data for SU-BTT exists but comprehensive historical records for all U.S. visits are not publicly available to confirm or refute this specific claim.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Source:** [Candace Owens Screws Up Time Zones While Promoting Latest Charlie Kirk Conspiracy](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/candace-owens-screws-time-zones-122944083.html)
**Verification Notes:** Candace Owens alleges an unnamed whistleblower claimed the Egyptian military plane carried subcontractors dropped off in Provo. The plane (SU-BTT, Dassault Falcon 7X) did land at Provo Municipal Airport on Sept 4, 2025, and Duncan Aviation confirmed it was there for scheduled maintenance per a long-standing service contract. However, the specific claim about military subcontractors being dropped off cannot be independently verified. No official investigation or law enforcement has corroborated this claim, and aviation authorities have not confirmed the presence of military personnel. The maintenance explanation is documented and the plane's movements are consistent with routine servicing.

**Verification Notes:** This claim alleges that Egyptian military subcontractors on a plane 'did not make it back to Cairo' and were 'mysteriously missing' after departing Provo. While there is documented evidence of an Egyptian Air Force plane (tail SU-BTT) at Provo on Sept 4-10, 2025, departing to Wilmington DE on Sept 10, no official sources (FBI, Egyptian government, aviation authorities) have confirmed passenger manifests, missing persons, or any investigation into missing Egyptian military personnel. The claim relies solely on anonymous whistleblower sources cited by Candace Owens. Without official verification of passenger lists or missing persons reports, this remains unverifiable despite the plane movements being documented.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This is a subjective characterization of Charlie Kirk's religious devotion and personal faith. While the speaker provides anecdotal evidence (references to Kirk frequently saying he needed to pray about decisions), assessing someone's internal religious devotion or love for God is inherently subjective and not empirically verifiable. This is a matter of personal testimony rather than objective fact.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This is a first-person claim by the speaker about their own investigative work - stating they were able to locate George Zinn in crowd footage.

**Source:** [Erika Kirk Forgives. The Feds Forget... | Candace Ep 240 @ 00:07:50](/episodes/ep-ja26iltROkM.md#t-00-07-50)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This is a firsthand eyewitness account from the speaker describing what they personally observed in footage of the Charlie Kirk shooting aftermath. The claim states they did not see blood on Charlie Kirk's back, only on his left hand. This is unverifiable because: 1) It is a subjective observation about private footage that was not publicly released, 2) The speaker explicitly stated they promised not to share the footage, 3) Without access to the actual footage, independent verification is impossible, 4) Eyewitness accounts of what someone personally saw cannot be fact-checked without the underlying evidence.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim is a quote attributed to Andrew Kolvet (Turning Point USA spokesperson) who claims to have spoken with Charlie Kirk's surgeon. The claim includes specific medical details about the bullet and forensic findings. Without access to the actual medical records, autopsy report, or direct verification from the surgeon, these second-hand medical claims cannot be independently verified. The speaker (Candace Owens) later disputes some of these claims, suggesting skepticism about their accuracy.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim about a pipeline's location relative to Charlie Kirk's position at the shooting cannot be independently verified. The speaker references 'old pictures' showing a pipeline 'almost exactly behind where Charlie was sitting' but doesn't provide these images or cite specific sources. Campus infrastructure details like pipeline locations are typically not part of public reporting about the shooting. Without access to UVU campus infrastructure maps or the specific photos referenced, this claim cannot be verified.

Searches across web results and X posts yielded information on unrelated incidents, such as a July 2025 near-miss at Minot Airport and Egyptian jets in Provo on September 10th, but nothing matching the specific claim.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** Unverifiable. No credible sources confirm this specific claim about video provenance. Extensive reporting on the Butler shooting includes bodycam footage of police officers and videos of Crooks at the rally, but no mainstream sources mention a video of 'the shooter running away after the shot' recorded by 'someone in the ROTC' and sent 'through three people.' FBI and police bodycam footage shows aftermath scenes, but this specific claim about ROTC involvement and video chain-of-custody cannot be verified through reliable sources.

**Verification Notes:** This claim is about a private text message allegedly sent by Charlie Kirk in February 2024 saying 'Catholicism is sounding better and better.' While multiple sources confirm Kirk had been showing increasing interest in Catholicism, was attending Mass with his Catholic wife, reportedly prayed the rosary daily, and was said to be considering conversion, the specific text message content and exact date cannot be independently verified through public sources. Private communications between individuals can only be verified by the participants themselves or through released screenshots.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources, including The New York Times, Axios, and The Guardian, report on Candace Owens promoting conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination, including claims of screenshots from group chats, but none provide independent verification of the screenshot's authenticity. Posts on X discuss Owens sharing the screenshot, but X content is not conclusive evidence. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., the assassination date around September 10, 2025, based on timeline in sources) with unverified ones (the chat's existence and content). Verification would require statements from chat participants (e.g., Rob McCoy or others named), digital forensic analysis of the screenshot, or official investigation records from law enforcement, such as FBI documents obtained via FOIA.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources confirm Lance Twiggs had substance abuse issues with drugs and alcohol, and family members kicked him out due to problematic behavior. However, no specific incident involving 'drinking a bottle of vodka' or 'almost overdosing' at Christmas approximately three years ago appears in any published sources. News reports mention substance abuse generally but don't provide details about specific overdose incidents. The claim appears to be based on private family information not publicly documented. Sources: Fox News, Gateway Pundit, Israel Hayom, WION reports on Lance Twiggs.

**Source:** [Charlie Kirk Shooting Suspect Charged. Something Isn’t Ri... @ 00:31:39](/episodes/ep-q7f8r-THr84.md#t-00-31-39)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim alleges that Tyler Robinson (NOT Lance Twiggs as the context might suggest) 'showed up on drugs' and was 'spouting about political stuff' on Easter Sunday (presumably Easter 2025, which was April 20, 2025). The claim is attributed to anonymous family sources speaking to Candace Owens. Extensive searches of official sources including court documents, FBI statements, media reports, and Robinson's family interviews do not mention any Easter Sunday incident involving drugs. While Robinson's mother confirmed to investigators that he had become 'more political over the last year,' no public records corroborate the specific Easter Sunday drug incident. Without official documentation or named sources, this remains unverifiable hearsay.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Verification Notes:** This claim asks whether Charlie Kirk was offered more money and funding from Benjamin Netanyahu.

**Verification Notes:** Brian Harpole (Charlie Kirk's head of security) did give an interview to Shawn Ryan (note: spelled 'Shawn' not 'Sean') on the Shawn Ryan Show episode #254 on November 17, 2025 about the Charlie Kirk shooting. The claim that he 'lied badly' is a subjective opinion that cannot be fact-checked without specific assertions being identified. What constitutes a 'lie' vs disputed interpretation vs memory discrepancy would require detailed fact-checking of specific statements made in the interview.

**Verification Notes:** Candace Owens claims Andrew Kolvet said this to her in a phone call 72 hours after Kirk's assassination. This is a claimed quote from a private conversation between two people. While Owens has publicly stated this on her podcast (confirmed via web search), there is no way to independently verify whether Kolvet actually said these words, as it was a private phone call with no recording or witnesses. Kolvet has not publicly confirmed or denied this quote.

While Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025 is confirmed by multiple sources (Wikipedia, NBC News, CNN), the specific conversation about a list is Owens' personal account that cannot be independently verified through public sources.

**Verification Notes:** This claim about an Egyptian plane (tail number SUBTT) landing at a federally monitored hangar and a foreign dignitary being moved to 920 King Street cannot be verified through public sources. No search results confirm the existence of 920 King Street as a location housing DEA, FBI, and Secret Service offices. The specific flight details, tail number, and dignitary movement are not publicly verifiable.

**Verification Notes:** Cannot independently verify this personal account. While Trump and Macron did meet on February 24, 2025 (confirmed by multiple sources including C-SPAN, NPR, CBS News), and the meeting did discuss Ukraine peace negotiations, there is no public documentation of Charlie Kirk calling Owens on behalf of the White House that day. This is a personal communication claim that only the parties involved can verify. News reports from later in 2025 mention Owens claiming Trump called her about Brigitte Macron in June, but do not confirm the February 24 Charlie Kirk call.

While multiple sources confirm the broader controversy involving Owens, Trump, and the Macrons regarding Brigitte Macron, the specific detail that 'Sergio Gor called on February 25th' cannot be independently verified as it describes a private communication.

**Verification Notes:** Cannot independently verify this personal account. There is no public documentation of President Trump calling Owens on February 26, 2025. News sources from later in 2025 mention Owens claiming Trump called her in June about stopping discussion of Brigitte Macron in relation to Ukraine peace negotiations, but there is no corroboration of a February 26 call. This is a private communication that only the parties involved can verify. Given the sensitive nature and lack of any corroborating evidence, confidence is low.

**Verification Notes:** This claim reports anecdotal information from locals who allegedly emailed Candace Owens saying the FBI instructed them not to share footage. No independent verification exists for these private communications. While it is standard practice for law enforcement to request that evidence not be publicly shared during active investigations to avoid compromising prosecutions, the specific claim about locals being told they were 'not allowed to share it at all' cannot be verified through public sources. This is hearsay from unnamed sources.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Verification Notes:** Netanyahu stated in interviews after Kirk's death that he invited Kirk to Israel and that 'sadly that visit will not take place,' but did not explicitly say whether Kirk accepted or declined. Bill Ackman denied Owens' claims about the nature of the invitation. The specific claim that Kirk 'declined to go' cannot be independently verified from public sources, though various parties dispute the characterization of events.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** The claim text 'I do what was the YWLS conference right after that' appears to be a transcription error or garbled speech. The speaker seems to be referencing an event after being fired from The Daily Wire, but the actual conference name or statement is unclear from the transcript. Without being able to identify what 'YWLS conference' refers to, this claim cannot be verified.

**Source:** [EXCLUSIVE! Another Photo Of Tyler Robinson | Candace Ep 238 @ 00:41:24](/episodes/ep-sreYYcID-QY.md#t-00-41-24)
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Verification Notes:** This claim makes a subjective characterization about 'Zionists' putting pressure on Charlie Kirk and attempting to control him. This is unverifiable because: 1) It relies on the speaker's interpretation of events and motivations, 2) The term 'Zionists' is vague and not clearly defined, 3) Claims about 'circling' and 'trying to control' are subjective assessments rather than objective facts, 4) Without documented evidence of specific individuals or groups and their actions, this characterization cannot be independently verified. The speaker does reference a conversation with Charlie Kirk about pressure, but the framing as 'Zionists circling' is interpretive.

He is directly responsible for this construction at Bracebridge, and he was the one that finalized the deal. I find it very strange how he ran this company for more than a decade. And for some reason, just a few months before Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) death, he decides to switch roles

**Verification Notes:** This is a personal statement about what an individual (appears to be a family member or associate) has personally seen. The claim is not about whether autopsy reports or evidence exist, but rather about this specific person's access to and viewing of these materials. Without independent confirmation from law enforcement, the coroner's office, or the individual's legal team, we cannot verify whether this person actually had access to these materials. This is testimonial/personal rather than a factual claim that can be independently verified.

The Wikipedia entry describes TPUSA's mission and operations but does not address event booking processes or timelines. Posts on X suggest events are usually scheduled far in advance, but these cannot be used as conclusive evidence due to potential unreliability.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as news articles, court documents, or official statements, were found in the provided web results to confirm or refute the specific claim about Rob McCoy's long-term friendship with Thomas Camino post-conviction, or Camino's alleged involvement in the Calvary Chapel Church's Home Fellowship program granting access to children in 2022. The linked source is a 2022 news article profiling McCoy but does not mention Camino or the controversy. Posts on X discuss similar allegations stemming from the podcast, but they are not reliable evidence and reflect public sentiment rather than verified facts. To verify, would require access to 2022 news archives (e.g., local California outlets like VC Star or LA Times), court records of Camino's conviction, or official church statements/records from Calvary Chapel regarding the Home Fellowship program and any related controversies.
