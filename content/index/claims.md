**Verification Notes:** Multiple news articles, including this one from Hindustan Times, report that Josh Hammer released full text messages from a group chat involving Charlie Kirk to refute Candace Owens' claims, confirming a Zoom call or long talk the night before Kirk's death. However, no reliable sources quote or confirm any specific text from Kirk saying 'they are gonna kill me' on the same day as the Zoom call. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., the existence of a night call and released texts about frustration with donors) with an unsubstantiated allegation about the 'kill me' text and its timing. To verify, access to the complete original text message screenshots, timestamps, or an official investigation report (e.g., via law enforcement or court documents) would be required, as news reports do not provide this detail.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple established news outlets, including NPR, Fox News, ABC News, and CNN, provide detailed timelines of the September 10, 2025, shooting at Utah Valley University, confirming that Charlie Kirk was shot at approximately 12:23 p.m. MT. This specific time is consistently reported in official updates from the FBI and law enforcement, aligning with eyewitness accounts and security footage references in the timelines.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including the Salt Lake Tribune (published approximately 4.5 hours after the shooting), The Hill, BBC, and others, report on George Zinn's arrest and role, with publication times starting several hours post-shooting (shooting at 12:23 p.m. MT on September 10, 2025). No primary sources, such as official Utah police statements or news reports, indicate an announcement 30 minutes after the shooting; official details emerged later, contradicting the claim's timeline.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including PBS, NBC, CBS, BBC, NPR, ABC, and CNBC, report on Governor Cox's statements and interviews following the Charlie Kirk shooting, focusing on a single suspect in custody with no mention of a second suspect or any description of dark clothing. One source explicitly notes authorities' confidence that the suspect acted alone, contradicting the claim of a second suspect being mentioned in any press conference.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable fact-check sources confirm a real photo exists of Tyler Robinson wearing a plain shirt (described in multiple reports as maroon) and shorts, taken in the context of his arrival on campus the morning of the incident. Posts found on X align with the 8:07 a.m. timeline and outfit description, supporting the official narrative. However, confidence is medium due to some online debate questioning if it's him, though primary news sources treat the photo as authentic and of Robinson.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple established news outlets (LiveMint, TMZ, Daily Mail, Fox News) report footage, including TMZ-obtained video, showing Tyler Robinson in a maroon t-shirt and shorts walking near or towards Utah Valley University campus at 8:07 a.m. Posts on X attribute outfit details and confirmation of an outfit change to Governor Cox's statements, aligning with official briefings where Cox revealed suspect details, supporting the claim that he confirmed the footage identification.

**Verification Notes:** The FBI's official press conference remarks from September 11, 2025, confirm the recovery of a high-powered bolt-action rifle from a wooded area where the shooter fled, believed to be the weapon used in the shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. This is corroborated by multiple reliable news sources including Reuters, PBS, USA Today, and NBC News, all reporting the same details from the FBI announcement.

> New York Post published exclusive photo of gun at 9:21 a.m. Mountain Time, two hours after FBI press conference

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** Searches for New York Post articles matching the claim returned no results confirming an exclusive photo of the gun published at 9:21 a.m. Mountain Time (11:21 a.m. Eastern) on September 11, 2025. Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, NY Times, ABC News, and NBC News, describe official releases of photos, video, and rifle details by the FBI and law enforcement on September 11, but none attribute an exclusive gun photo to the New York Post. An FBI press conference occurred on September 11 (aligning with the 'two hours after' timeline if at ~7 a.m. MT), but the specific NY Post publication could not be located. Verification would require access to New York Post's publication archives or internal records from September 11, 2025, to confirm or refute the existence and timing of such an article.

> Tyler Robinson in custody around 7 p.m. Sep 11 when local texts circulated he was picked up in Warner Valley

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_James_Robinson)
**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources, including Wikipedia (sourced from news reports) and articles from BBC, NBC, CNN, and NPR, confirm Tyler Robinson was taken into custody on the evening of September 11, 2025, after surrendering at the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Utah, facilitated by his family and a retired detective. However, no primary sources (e.g., official police statements, arrest records, or news articles) specify the exact time as around 7 p.m., mention local texts circulating at that time, or indicate he was 'picked up' in Warner Valley (sources describe a voluntary surrender, not a pickup). Posts on X suggest times like 10 p.m. or 11 p.m., but these are inconclusive and not reliable evidence. Verification would require access to official arrest logs, police reports from Washington County Sheriff's Office, or FOIA-requested documents detailing the exact timeline and location; news archives do not provide this level of specificity for the custody event.

> President Trump announces at 6 a.m. Sep 12 with high degree of certainty suspect in custody

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [N/A](N/A)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources such as news articles, official statements, or government documents were found confirming that President Trump made an announcement at exactly 6 a.m. on September 12 about a suspect being in custody with a high degree of certainty. Posts on X from that date quote similar statements attributed to Trump on Fox & Friends, but X posts are inconclusive and cannot serve as factual evidence on their own. The claim mixes a specific time (6 a.m.) with a verifiable public appearance format (Fox & Friends, which airs starting at 6 a.m. ET), but without transcripts, video footage, or reports from established outlets like Fox News, CNN, or the White House, it remains unverifiable. Verification would require access to official Fox News archives, White House press releases, or contemporaneous news reports from September 12, 2025.

**Veracity:** True (high)
**Source:** [IN THE COUNTY OF UTAH, STATE OF UTAH State of Utah vs. Tyler Robinson - Probable Cause Affidavit](https://media.deseret.com/media/misc/pdf/dn/news/RobinsonPC.pdf)
**Verification Notes:** The claim directly matches the details in the official probable cause affidavit from the Utah County court, a primary government document, which states that surveillance footage showed Tyler Robinson arriving on UVU campus in a gray Dodge Challenger at approximately 8:29 a.m. on September 10, wearing a plain maroon t-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo, and light-colored shoes. It further notes he was encountered in consistent clothing early on September 12. Multiple news outlets, including FOX 13 and ABC News, report on the arrest and reference similar details from official statements, supporting the claim's accuracy.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** True (medium)
**Source:** [Charlie Kirk lost donors over support for Tucker Carlson | The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-869781)
**Verification Notes:** The Jerusalem Post article reports on leaked messages from Candace Owens showing Charlie Kirk criticizing donors after losing a $2 million donation, directly supporting the claim's core elements. Additional web sources, including a Pravda EN article quoting Tucker Carlson, confirm the specific detail of the loss occurring two days before Kirk's death due to the pledge to feature Carlson at the Turning Point conference. Social media posts on X further corroborate this with references to a specific donor (Robert J. Shillman) withdrawing a $2 million pledge, though these are secondary and based on the same leaks and statements. No contradicting evidence was found in reliable sources.

**Source:** [Antisemitic and Anti-Israel Conspiracy Theories Follow Fatal Shooting of Charlie Kirk | ADL](https://www.adl.org/resources/article/antisemitic-and-anti-israel-conspiracy-theories-follow-fatal-shooting-charlie)
**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as an official statement from the American Jewish Committee (AJC) or reports from established news outlets, were found confirming that the AJC called Charlie Kirk an anti-Semite and 'dangerous.' Searches yielded discussions of conspiracy theories surrounding Kirk's death and corrections to unrelated antisemitism claims about him, but nothing directly supporting this specific claim. X posts repeat similar assertions, but they are inconclusive and not reliable evidence. Verification would require an official AJC press release, archived statement on their website, or direct quotes in reputable news articles (e.g., via FOIA or AJC archives if not publicly available).

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** False (high)
**Source:** [Turning Point Usa Inc - Nonprofit Explorer - ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/800835023)
**Verification Notes:** ProPublica provides access to Turning Point USA's historical IRS Form 990 filings, which show a fiscal year ending June 30 (confirmed by posts found on X referencing filings like the one covering July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021). Per IRS rules, for a fiscal year ending June 30, the original Form 990 due date is November 15 of the same year, and filing for a 6-month extension moves the deadline to May 15 of the following year. The claim incorrectly states that the deadline with an extension is November 15, which is actually the original deadline without extension. No evidence was found of a change in fiscal year to make November 15 the extended date.

**Verification Notes:** The article reports Candace Owens' claim of an Egyptian Air Force plane (SU-BTT) flying out of Utah on Sept 10 after Charlie Kirk's assassination, implying a prior landing, but provides no independent confirmation of a Sept 4 landing or it being a 'full flight.' Other sources treat this as a conspiracy theory, with some noting debunking due to time zone confusion (e.g., UTC vs. local time). No primary evidence like flight logs or official records found; verification would require FAA flight data, Flightradar24 records for SU-BTT on Sept 4, 2025, or official US/Egyptian government statements.

**Verification Notes:** Official U.S. State Department guidelines confirm that foreign state aircraft, including military jets, require diplomatic clearance to enter and operate in U.S. airspace, ensuring federal government awareness and approval. Multiple sources, including FAA and DoD documents, support that such landings are monitored and cannot occur without attention. However, the claim's assertion of a required 'federal escort' (implying physical or airborne accompaniment) is not explicitly mandated in these policies; escorts may be provided in specific security contexts (e.g., interceptions per FAA guidelines) but are not a standard requirement for cleared flights.

**Verification Notes:** The claim lists five specific vehicles with license plates allegedly secured by Duncan Aviation in connection to a conspiracy theory about Charlie Kirk's assassination. While news sources and social media posts report Candace Owens making similar claims about rental cars and license plates (initially four, with a possible fifth added later), no reliable primary sources, such as official rental records, law enforcement reports, or company statements from Duncan Aviation, confirm these details. Verification would require access to private rental agreements, Duncan Aviation's internal records, or FOIA-requested documents from relevant authorities investigating the assassination. Established outlets discuss her theories but do not provide evidence supporting the specific vehicle and plate details as factual.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including major news outlets like CNN, were found confirming the existence of the claimed article or the student's account of seeing a man on the Lozier/Losee Center roof a week before the September 10, 2025, shooting. Available web results and X posts describe sightings on the day of the event but not prior weeks. The Wikipedia entry and FBI updates detail the assassination but omit any pre-event roof sightings. To verify, access to CNN archives from September 11, 2025, or direct statements from the alleged student/FBI tip line records via FOIA would be needed. Multiple search strategies yielded no supporting evidence, suggesting the claim may be unsubstantiated interpretation.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources (e.g., news articles from established outlets like Daily Mail, People, or Yahoo News, or official flight records) confirm or refute the existence of a specific plane departing Scottsdale at 8 a.m. local time and landing in Provo at 10 a.m. local time on September 10, 2025, owned by T.W. Lewis. Available web results focus on a different plane departing Provo after the shooting, with ownership unmasked in some reports, but not matching the claimed route or timing. X posts mention a morning flight linked to a TPUSA donor but are inconclusive and not reliable evidence. Verification would require public or FOIA-accessible flight records from FAA, FlightAware, or similar aviation databases to check registrations under T.W. Lewis or associated entities for that date and route.

**Verification Notes:** The claim that Joyce Chernick is married to Aubrey Chernick and that they fund pro-Israel causes through the David Horowitz Freedom Center is supported by reliable sources, including articles detailing their philanthropic activities and connections to conservative, pro-Israel organizations. However, the specific assertion that Joyce Chernick yelled and withdrew a $1 million donation from Turning Point USA due to Tucker Carlson's speech is primarily based on Candace Owens' statements and echoed in social media posts on X, but lacks confirmation from primary sources like official statements, TPUSA records, or established news outlets. Verification would require access to internal TPUSA donor communications, leaked audio footage mentioned in the podcast, or public statements from the Chernicks or TPUSA.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple established news outlets, including Daily Mail, Newsweek, and Western Journal, report that Andrew Kolvet confirmed the authenticity of the leaked text messages on the Charlie Kirk Show. This directly supports the claim that the screen grab is authentic. Additionally, Kolvet's statement about sharing it with people in government is consistent across reports and his own admission in the clip, with no contradicting evidence found.

**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official statements from Turning Point USA, published text messages, or reports from established news outlets (e.g., Reuters, BBC, or The Guardian), were found confirming or refuting the existence of written communications from Charlie Kirk expressing fear for his life the day before his death on September 10, 2025, or the off-record conversations with three individuals. Social media posts discuss Candace Owens' revelations and alleged screenshots, but these are inconclusive and cannot serve as evidence. The podcast episode title suggests TPUSA confirmed related text messages, but without external verification, the claim remains unsubstantiated. To verify, would require: public confirmation from the three unnamed sources, release and authentication of the written communications (e.g., via forensic analysis or court documents), or an official TPUSA statement; alternatively, investigative reporting from reliable news sources or FOIA requests for any related law enforcement records on threats to Kirk.

**Verification Notes:** Josh Hammer directly states in this interview that he spoke with Charlie Kirk on a Zoom call the night before Kirk's death, discussing Israel-related topics. This is corroborated by multiple posts on X (formerly Twitter) from various users, including one citing another individual (Eitan Fischberger) confirming the call involved Hammer and Rabbi PW. No sources refute the occurrence of the call, though it is a private event without public records like Zoom logs; confidence is medium due to reliance on self-reporting and social media corroboration without independent primary evidence like participant confirmations or call records.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official autopsy reports, medical examiner statements, or ballistics analyses from government or law enforcement agencies, were found to confirm or refute the specifics of the wound (entry vs. exit) or the exact moment of death relative to hitting the ground. Available news articles from outlets like The New York Times provide timelines and maps of the shooting but lack forensic details. Posts on X discuss conflicting claims about entry/exit wounds but are not conclusive evidence.

Multiple search strategies (e.g., queries on ballistics, gunshot wound analysis, shirt movement in shootings, and Rob O'Neill's comments on the Brian Thompson assassination) yielded no reliable evidence addressing this specific detail. To verify, access to classified military records, videos from O'Neill's operations, or independent ballistic experiments replicating similar conditions (e.g., clothing response to specific calibers and velocities) would be required, potentially via FOIA requests to the Department of Defense or expert forensic reconstructions.

**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Source:** [Pro-Israel Billionaire Who Led Mamdani Scaremongering Now Offers to Help NYC's Next Mayor | Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/ackman-congratulates-mamdani)
**Verification Notes:** Initial reports from October 2025 indicate Bill Ackman donated $1 million to Defend NYC, a super PAC opposing Mamdani. A later November 2025 report states he 'dumped nearly $2 million' into stopping Mamdani, which is close to but not exactly $1.75 million. The claim's specific amount is not precisely matched across sources, making it mixed with the higher figure supported but not exact.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including POLITICO and The New York Times, confirm that Michael Bloomberg donated a total of $8.3 million to a super PAC affiliated with Andrew Cuomo in the 2025 New York City mayoral race, with the explicit aim of supporting Cuomo and opposing Zohran Mamdani. Reports detail incremental donations adding up to this amount, and the super PAC's activities were focused on anti-Mamdani efforts.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable news sources, including the New York Daily News and Yahoo News, confirm Joe Gebbia donated $2 million to super PACs supporting Andrew Cuomo in opposition to Zohran Mamdani in the 2025 NYC mayoral race. Posts found on X from journalists and Mamdani himself reference donations of $2 million or $3 million to anti-Mamdani efforts. No sources confirm the exact figure of $3.1 million, making the specific amount inaccurate, but the claim of a significant donation to stop Mamdani is supported by evidence.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** True (medium)
**Source:** [Top pro-Israel TPUSA donor terminated support for Kirk in days before death, sources say - The Grayzone](https://thegrayzone.com/2025/09/22/israel-tpusa-donor-terminated-kirk/)
**Verification Notes:** The article reports that ultra-Zionist billionaire Robert Shillman (likely a reference to 'Bob Shulman,' possibly a misspelling) ended funding for Turning Point USA due to Charlie Kirk's increasingly critical views on Israel. Additional posts found on X and other web sources, including leaks from group chat messages shared by Candace Owens, specify that Shillman withdrew a $2 million pledge specifically because Kirk refused to cancel Tucker Carlson from appearing at events. This aligns with the claim's details, though the exact name 'Shulman' appears to be a variant or error for 'Shillman.' Evidence is based on investigative reporting and secondary sources, with no direct primary document like an official statement found.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, The Guardian, ABC News, BBC, and FBI releases, detail the shooting event, footage availability, security aspects, and timeline, but none directly address whether immediate first aid was administered by the security team, such as applying gauze or pressure to the wound. The widow's thanks to first responders in BBC reporting implies some response occurred, but this likely refers to emergency services rather than immediate security actions. To verify, access to the full multi-angle footage (as referenced in sources like The Guardian and ABC News visual timeline) or official incident reports from UVU security, first responders, or autopsy details would be required; these could be obtained via FOIA requests to the FBI or local authorities.

**Source:** [Utah Valley Shooting Updates | Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/utah-valley-shooting-updates)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official FBI statements, Utah government documents, or established news outlets (e.g., ABC News, The New York Times, BBC), confirm or refute the specific claim of FBI exerting pressure on Utah authorities to declare the Charlie Kirk assassination case closed as a lone gunman incident. Web searches and X posts reveal official narratives describing the suspect Tyler James Robinson as acting alone, with FBI collaboration in the investigation, but only unsubstantiated conspiracy theories on X suggest cover-ups or undue influence. Verification would require internal communications, such as leaked emails, FOIA-requested FBI or Utah state documents, or whistleblower testimony from involved authorities to confirm any pressure.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official FBI statements, Utah government documents, or established news outlets (e.g., CNN, PBS, NPR), confirm or mention any FBI pressure on Utah authorities to rule the assassination as a lone gunman act or to close the case. Official reports and news articles describe the incident as perpetrated by a single suspect, Tyler James Robinson, who was charged with aggravated murder, with authorities expressing confidence he acted alone (e.g., statements from Utah Gov. Spencer Cox). The claim originates from an anonymous 'authoritative source' in the podcast, which mixes verifiable facts (e.g., the suspect's name and charges) with unverified interpretation of motives. To verify, access to internal FBI or Utah law enforcement communications, such as emails or memos via FOIA requests, or public statements from involved officials would be needed. Posts on X reflect public sentiment and conspiracy speculation but do not provide conclusive evidence.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including Wikipedia, CNN, ABC News, or other major outlets, confirm or deny the existence of video footage showing Tyler Robinson firing the weapon or taking aim at Charlie Kirk. Reports detail CCTV footage of Robinson before and after the incident, but not the act itself. The case is ongoing with a trial scheduled for 2026, and detailed evidence (such as potential surveillance videos) has not been publicly disclosed. Verification would require access to court documents, prosecution evidence lists, official police reports, or FOIA requests to the FBI or Utah authorities for any non-public video evidence.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official forensic reports, court documents, or statements from law enforcement, were found detailing the condition of the bullet or any ballistic matching to Tyler Robinson's rifle. Available news articles discuss the suspect and ammunition but do not address bullet fragmentation or matching. Social media posts on X mention conflicting claims (e.g., some alleging a match, others questioning evidence), but these are not conclusive.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets or official flight records, confirm a plane departing Provo, Utah, at 7:14 a.m. local time on September 10, 2025, heading to Wilmington, Delaware, arriving at 11:51 a.m. Eastern. Web searches reveal discussions of post-shooting flights (e.g., private jet N888KG) and conspiracy theories on X about an Egyptian plane, but no verifiable details match the exact timing and route. Verification would require FAA flight logs, FlightAware data, or FOIA-requested aviation records for that date.

**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, PBS, NPR, ABC News, NBC News, FBI updates, CBS News, AP News, and The New York Times, confirm the assassination occurred on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, with Kirk shot in the neck during an event. However, none specify the exact time as 12:23 (presumably local Mountain Time). X posts mention details like the shooter arriving on campus at 11:52, but no precise shooting time is given. This claim cannot be verified without access to official documents such as police reports, FBI investigative timelines, or autopsy records, which could be obtained via FOIA requests or detailed news archives not present in available results.

**Veracity:** False (medium)
**Source:** [Contact Us - Richards, Layton & Finger](https://www.rlf.com/contact-us/)
**Verification Notes:** The address 920 North King Street in Wilmington, Delaware, is confirmed as the location of Richards, Layton & Finger, a private law firm, based on their official website. No primary sources, such as official government directories or websites for the DEA or Secret Service, list these agencies at this address in the search results. Posts found on X suggest the agencies may be at a different location (e.g., 500 Delaware Avenue), but this information is treated as inconclusive due to the controversial nature of the topic. The claim that public directories currently show the DEA and Secret Service at this address is not supported and appears incorrect.

**Source:** [Field Offices | Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)
**Verification Notes:** The official FBI website lists field offices but does not specify 920 North King Street as the address for the Wilmington Resident Agency. Provided web search results for the query including 'Google info panel' do not show or confirm that Google displays this address. Multiple X posts from users who conducted Google searches and contacted the Baltimore FBI office (which oversees Delaware) state that no Google results show FBI offices at 920 North King Street, and the actual address is 500 Delaware Avenue. One post notes the FBI moved from North King Street some time ago. This contradicts the claim that Google will likely show 920 North King Street.

**Verification Notes:** Conflicting statements exist from primary sources involved in the event: Frank Turek claimed in an interview on the Megyn Kelly Show that Charlie Kirk's team used drones to monitor the crowd and sent video footage, while Brian Harpole, head of security, stated in a podcast that drones were not allowed and not used. No independent reliable sources, such as news articles, official TPUSA statements, police reports from the assassination investigation, or FAA drone flight records, were found to confirm or refute the claim. Verification would require access to FAA flight logs for September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University or official documents from the law enforcement investigation into the event.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, ABC News, Reuters, AP News, and local outlets like Lehi Free Press, confirm Charlie Kirk was rushed to and pronounced dead at Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem, Utah, following the shooting at Utah Valley University. This supports the claim that he was taken to Timpanogos, described as a smaller regional hospital. However, the claim that it was 'a little farther away' and a 'trauma III center' is mixed: posts on X and some reports suggest Utah Valley Hospital (a Level II trauma center) was closer and better equipped for severe trauma, indicating Timpanogos may indeed be farther and less equipped (potentially Level III), but official news sources do not explicitly confirm or refute the distance or exact trauma level comparison, mixing verifiable facts with interpretive elements.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources, including the Daily Mail article and posts on X, confirm that Kash Patel fired the chief of the Utah FBI bureau (Mehtab Syed, a woman) in August 2025, a month before the Charlie Kirk assassination in September. Multiple news outlets and X posts support the firing and gutting of Utah FBI leadership. However, no sources mention the replacement being specifically Robert Bowles, making that part of the claim unverifiable without official FBI personnel records or announcements (e.g., via FOIA request or FBI press releases).

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, such as news articles or flight tracking records, were found to support or refute the claim that a plane with tail number SUBTT (likely referring to an Egyptian-registered aircraft, possibly SU-BTT) was in Utah in 2023 at the same time as Charlie Kirk or a Turning Point USA event. Available web results and X posts focus on conspiracy theories related to a 2025 Egyptian Air Force plane sighting in Utah but do not address 2023. Verification would require historical flight logs from databases like FlightAware or ADS-B Exchange for the specific tail number, cross-referenced with news reports or official schedules of Charlie Kirk's appearances in Utah in 2023.

**Verification Notes:** The claim about an Egyptian military plane (tail number SU-BND) departing Provo, Utah, three days after Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025, is contradicted by reliable news sources reporting that similar allegations by Candace Owens were debunked due to her confusion of UTC with local Utah time. No primary sources, such as FAA flight records or official statements, confirm any Egyptian military planes departing Provo around that date; instead, reports treat these as unsubstantiated conspiracy theories facing backlash. Verification would require access to official FAA or FlightAware flight logs for September 13, 2025, at Provo Airport (PVU).

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources confirm the exact date of February 27th (likely 2023 based on context) for Sean Feucht's announcement as a Turning Point USA Faith contributor. Available sources discuss a partnership for the 'Kingdom to the Capitol' tour launching in March 2023, but do not specify an announcement on February 27th. To verify, an official TPUSA press release, social media post, or news article dated February 27, 2023, would be required; further searches with varied queries (e.g., exact date archives) yielded no such evidence.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources, including Turning Point USA's official Faith website and posts on X, confirm a TPUSA Faith Pastors Summit occurred in Nashville in 2023, but the date was May 24-26, not March 24. Additionally, an official page for a 2022 summit (tpusafaith.com/summit22/) indicates the 2023 event was not the first-ever, contradicting that part of the claim. The Nashville location is accurate.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, CNN, NPR, ABC News, and The New York Times, confirm that a mass shooting occurred on March 27, 2023, at The Covenant School (a private Christian elementary school) in Nashville, Tennessee. The shooter, 28-year-old Aiden Hale (born Audrey Hale), identified as transgender and killed three children and three adults before being killed by police. The claim's description of a 'trans shooting' aligns with the shooter's reported transgender identity, and the date and location are accurate.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple sources, including news articles and LinkedIn profiles, confirm Mikey McCoy held the position of Chief of Staff at Turning Point USA starting in 2024 and continuing into 2025. However, no reliable public sources specify the exact promotion date of January 3, 2024. The claim references an internal email, which cannot be independently verified without access to Turning Point USA's internal communications or official announcements. To confirm the precise date, access to internal emails, HR records, or a FOIA-equivalent request (if applicable) would be required, but as a private organization, such details are not publicly available.

**Verification Notes:** A September 2025 news article from the Lincoln Journal Star reports that Turning Point USA planned to establish a chapter at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2024, but those plans were put on hold due to a protest that escalated into a political crisis. The university was only prepared to recognize the chapter in 2025 after securing a faculty adviser. This directly contradicts the claim of starting a chapter on February 11, 2024. No reliable sources, including official TPUSA announcements or news reports, were found confirming a chapter start on that specific date in 2024, though an earlier chapter formation was reported in 2018.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including MinistryWatch, Christianity Today, and Religion News Service, confirm credible accusations of fraud, embezzlement, and financial misconduct against Sean Feucht from former leaders and employees, with calls for investigations. These reports were published in early June 2025, not June 2024 as claimed, making the date inaccurate while the substance of the accusations is supported.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including news articles or official records, provide evidence that a specific plane tail number was searched on Google from Israel on September 8th, two days before Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10th. The claim appears in Candace Owens' podcast as part of broader conspiracy theories involving planes and Israel, but it lacks supporting documentation. Verification would require access to Google's private search logs or data (e.g., via subpoena or internal records), which are not publicly available. Google Trends was suggested in the transcript, but it does not offer granular, country-specific data for obscure terms like tail numbers on exact dates. Multiple searches across web and X/Twitter yielded discussions of Owens' related claims (e.g., Egyptian planes, Israel links) but no confirmation or refutation of this specific Google search allegation.

**Verification Notes:** No primary or reliable sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., CNN, ABC News, The Guardian) or official statements, confirm that federal authorities seized footage from Timpanogos Hospital related to Charlie Kirk's shooting. The provided web search results detail the shooting event on September 10, 2025, but do not mention any hospital involvement or footage seizure. The claim appears to circulate primarily on X (formerly Twitter) and in the podcast, often tied to conspiracy theories, but lacks corroboration. To verify, access to official FBI investigative reports, hospital records, or a FOIA request for federal seizure documents would be required. Reliable sources also do not confirm Kirk was taken to Timpanogos Hospital; they report he was fatally shot at the event site.

**Verification Notes:** The Utah Bureau of EMS lists Level I trauma centers in Utah as Intermountain Medical Center and University of Utah Hospital (not Utah Valley Hospital). Additional sources confirm Utah Valley Hospital is a Level II trauma center, contradicting the claim that it is Level I. Timpanogos Regional Hospital is confirmed as Level III via its official website. Thus, the trauma level for Timpanogos is accurate, but for UV Hospital is not. 'Less equipped' aligns with Level II being higher than Level III. 'Further' is context-dependent and unverifiable without the incident's exact location, though some social media discussions suggest varying distances based on site (e.g., closer from UVU).

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news outlets, including NBC, NPR, ABC, CBS, POLITICO, and Axios, report that on December 4, 2025, the FBI arrested Brian J. Cole, a Virginia man, in connection with the January 5, 2021, pipe bombs near DNC and RNC headquarters. The claim appears to stem from a November 2025 Blaze Media report alleging a forensic match to former Capitol Police officer Shauni Rae Kerkhoff (similar to the named 'Shawna Rae Kirkhoff'), but Blaze Media retracted this report on December 4, 2025, after the official arrest. Snopes also confirms the retraction and the charging of Cole, contradicting the claim.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including news articles or official statements, confirm that a CIA spokeswoman named Liz Lyon made any statement about Shawna Rae Kirkhoff (or similar spellings like Shauni Rae Kerkhoff) working in Capitol Police Campus Security or living in Alexandria, Virginia. Searches for primary sources yielded reports about Kerkhoff from outlets like Blaze Media, which later retracted its claims linking her to the Jan. 6 pipe bombs after federal authorities charged Brian J. Cole instead. X posts mention Kerkhoff's background but attribute it to investigative reports, not a CIA spokeswoman. The absence of any evidence for Liz Lyon's statement across multiple sources indicates the claim is contradicted or fabricated.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (medium)
**Source:** [Lance Wallnau | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LanceWallnau/)
**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as direct screenshots, archived posts, or news articles, were found confirming a Facebook post by Lance Wallnau on November 6, 2020, with the exact quoted text. Searches for related web results and X posts show Wallnau's involvement in promoting election fraud claims and 'Stop the Steal' narratives in November 2020 (e.g., X posts from November 16, 26, and 30 discussing fraud in swing states), but none reference a specific Facebook post on that date with the claimed phrasing. To verify, access to Facebook archives, Wayback Machine captures of the post, or contemporaneous news reports quoting it exactly would be required. The claim may be based on real activity but lacks verifiable evidence in available sources.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Baptist News Global, The Washington Post, and archived reports, confirm that four out of six protest permits issued on January 6, 2021, were granted to independent charismatic Christian groups, many affiliated with the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), which had been involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. No contradicting evidence was found in established news outlets or government records.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [January 6 United States Capitol attack - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack)
**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, established news outlets, or official documents were found confirming that exactly fifteen pastors and leaders surrounded Donald Trump at the White House before the January 6 Stop the Steal rally to discuss spiritual warfare. Posts found on X mention 15 NAR apostles and prophets meeting with high-level Trump administration officials on December 29, 2020, but this information is inconclusive for a controversial topic, does not specify the location as the White House, and does not confirm direct interaction with Trump himself. The cited Wikipedia page provides general context on January 6 events but lacks details on this specific claim. To verify, access to White House visitor logs from late December 2020, FOIA-requested documents from the Trump administration, or firsthand accounts from participants (e.g., via investigative reports or books by experts like Matthew D. Taylor) would be needed.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Mixed (medium)
**Source:** [Lance Wallnau - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Wallnau)
**Verification Notes:** Wikipedia confirms that Lance Wallnau attended Valley Forge Military Academy and College (supporting the graduation from a military academy) and that his father, Carl Wallnau, was an Air Force major. However, no reliable sources, including Wikipedia or other web results, mention Carl Wallnau serving under General Patton. This part of the claim appears unverifiable based on available information; verification would require access to military service records (e.g., via FOIA request to the National Archives or Department of Defense personnel files) to confirm any WWII-era service details under Patton's command.

**Verification Notes:** Searches across web sources and X posts reveal evidence of partnerships and collaborations between Lance Wallnau and Turning Point USA (TPUSA), including joint tours like the Courage Tour and efforts to mobilize voters in swing states, but no reliable primary sources (e.g., news articles, financial disclosures, or official statements) confirm or refute Wallnau providing significant funding to TPUSA Faith operations. Claims of behind-the-scenes funding appear based on anonymous internal sources, which are inherently unverifiable without public documentation. Verification would require access to TPUSA's detailed IRS Form 990 donor schedules, audited financial statements, or confirmed disclosures from Wallnau or TPUSA officials; no such records are publicly available in searched sources.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** False (high)
**Source:** [Thousand Oaks shooting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Oaks_shooting)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, NYT, CNN, and LA Times, confirm the shooter in the 2018 Thousand Oaks Borderline Bar incident was Ian David Long, a 28-year-old Marine veteran, who acted alone and died by suicide. There is no evidence that his mother was involved in the shooting, directly contradicting the claim. No primary sources (news articles, official statements) support a friendship or family connection between Rob McCoy and Ian David Long or his family; searches for such links yield only unsubstantiated social media speculation, making that part unverifiable but not altering the false core attribution of the shooting to the mother.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including local news outlets and biographical profiles, confirm that Rob McCoy served as Mayor of Thousand Oaks from December 2018 through December 2019. The Borderline Bar and Grill shooting occurred on November 7, 2018, so his assumption of the mayoral role in December 2018 is approximately one month later. In Thousand Oaks, the mayor is selected annually by the city council from its members, which aligns with the claim's timeline and use of 'elected' in the context of council selection.

**Source:** [How the Charlie Kirk shooting unfolded – in maps, videos and images | Charlie Kirk shooting | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images)
**Verification Notes:** The claim recounts a private conversation where an unnamed individual describes their position next to Charlie Kirk during the shooting and their immediate assessment of his condition. While news sources like The Guardian provide visual timelines, maps, and videos of the incident, they do not identify specific individuals seated to Kirk's left or confirm actions like securing footage. Social media posts discuss footage and suspicions about people near Kirk, but these are not reliable primary sources. Verification would require the individual's identity, access to unedited event footage for position confirmation, and possibly call records or statements from Candace Owens or the individual to substantiate the conversation.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official statements from TPUSA, the FBI, or investigative reports, confirm or refute that a specific individual secured and handed over footage to federal authorities following Charlie Kirk's shooting. News articles discuss Owens' claims about unreleased FBI-held video related to the incident, but do not verify the specific conversation or action described. Verification would require access to FBI investigative records, TPUSA internal communications, or court documents from the ongoing investigation, potentially obtainable via FOIA request.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources, including Soap Central and Times of India, report Candace Owens' claim that she viewed private footage from behind Charlie Kirk showing no blood or gore. However, the footage has not been publicly released, and no independent verification from official sources (e.g., forensic reports or law enforcement) confirms or refutes what it depicts. Verification would require public release of the footage, an official autopsy report detailing wound ballistics, or FOIA-requested documents from the FBI or local authorities investigating the September 10, 2025, shooting.

**Verification Notes:** Searches of Caldera Engineering's website (calderaengineering.com) and related pages do not reveal any map showing engineering projects by country, nor any mention of work in Israel or dots representing projects there. Multiple site pages, including About Us, History, and Engineering sections, were reviewed with no reference to Israel or such a map. Additional searches for variations like project maps or international collaborations also yielded no supporting evidence, contradicting the claim.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, such as news articles or official TPUSA announcements, were found confirming Candace Owens spoke at two TPUSA conferences or participated in the Live Free Tour with Charlie Kirk in 2024 ('last year' relative to the 2025 podcast date). Available sources, including Wikipedia, reference her involvement with TPUSA events in 2018 but provide no evidence for 2024. To verify, access to TPUSA's official 2024 event archives, speaker lists, video footage, or contemporaneous news reports from established outlets covering the specific conferences and tour dates would be required. The claim mixes verifiable past association with TPUSA (e.g., 2018 events) but the specific timing and details for 2024 remain unsupported.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources confirm or refute the existence of a specific text message from Charlie Kirk to Candace Owens dated May 22, 2025, with the described content about free speech censorship. While Turning Point USA has confirmed the authenticity of other leaked messages from Kirk regarding Israel-related pressures (from two days before his death), this particular May 22 exchange is not mentioned in any news articles, official statements, or verified documents.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official FBI statements or documents, confirm the existence of footage showing a woman with the shooter (Tyler Robinson) or any suppression by the FBI. Established news outlets like BBC, CBS, CNN, and The Guardian report on the shooting investigation, suspect details, evidence (e.g., DNA, confessions), and motives but do not mention any such footage or woman. The claim originates from Candace Owens' podcast and social media posts on X, with one news article (The Economic Times) reporting her allegation without independent verification. To verify, access to the alleged door cam footage, FBI investigative records (via FOIA request), or confirmation from multiple reliable outlets that have reviewed the evidence would be needed. The lack of corroboration in official or major news sources for this high-profile case suggests it remains an unsubstantiated claim.

> The venue was indeed secured in quick order, but that was because they had help from the White House, and Turning Point did not book that venue back in May, so we can formally debunk that. I was told that the White House stepped in and put in a personal phone call to the event coordinator. And they actually did already have an event that was scheduled. And the White House simply asked those people if they would be willing to move or reschedule their event. It was apparently supposed to be an RV show.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Source:** [Memorial service of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_service_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** The memorial service for Charlie Kirk is well-documented as occurring at State Farm Stadium on September 21, 2025, with over 90,000 attendees and speeches from President Trump, Vice President Vance, and others. However, no reliable sources (including news articles from Fox News, CBS, PBS, NBC, USA Today, CNN, and Wikipedia) confirm or refute White House involvement in securing the venue, a personal phone call to the event coordinator, or the rescheduling of a scheduled RV show. X posts discuss rumors of a pre-booking in May but do not provide evidence for the claim's details. To verify, access to State Farm Stadium rental agreements, official White House or Turning Point USA statements on the booking process, or confirmation from RV show organizers about rescheduling would be required. No such primary evidence was found despite searching with variations on queries related to venue booking, White House involvement, and RV show rescheduling.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Hindustan Times, Wikipedia, and fact-checking sites like Factually.co, confirm that an autopsy was performed on Charlie Kirk following his shooting death on September 10, 2025, as required by Utah law for homicides.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including news articles from Times Now, Fox News, and Hindustan Times, as well as podcasts from CrossExamined and I Don't Have Enough FAITH to Be an ATHEIST, report on Pastor Rob McCoy discussing the future of Turning Point USA shortly after Charlie Kirk's assassination. These sources describe McCoy revealing plans to continue Kirk's legacy, with involvement from Mikey McCoy as Chief of Staff, aligning with the claim of a clear succession plan being implemented. No reliable sources contradict this, though some social media posts express skepticism.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news articles, including from National File and Internewscast Journal, report that video footage from the September 10th incident directly contradicts Pastor Rob McCoy's account. The video shows Mikey McCoy turning and walking away less than a second after the shot, on his phone, without any blood on him or checking on Charlie Kirk, refuting the claim of an immediate call to his father describing the shooting in the neck and requesting prayers. Posts on X further highlight this timeline discrepancy, with sources agreeing the pastor's version is inaccurate.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources and social media discussions, including articles from The Times of India and The Guardian, report on Candace Owens' podcast claims about discrepancies in the narrative surrounding Charlie Kirk's shooting, such as Mikey McCoy's position and lack of blood evidence. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) describe video footage showing McCoy behind the tent, walking away immediately after the shot without approaching Kirk, supporting the claim that he had no blood on him. No reliable sources refute this, though it mixes verifiable video analysis with interpretive conspiracy elements; confidence is medium due to reliance on secondary reports of video without direct primary access.

**Verification Notes:** The claim originates from the podcast's own analysis of slowed-down video footage, stating exactly 834 milliseconds between the shot sound and Mikey McCoy raising his phone. No independent reliable sources (e.g., news articles from established outlets like Daily Mail or Wikipedia entries) confirm or refute this precise measurement. Posts on X repeat similar timings (e.g., 0.8 seconds) but vary (some claim before the shot) and are not conclusive evidence. To verify, access to the original high-resolution video footage of the September 10, 2025, event and precise audio-visual timing tools would be required for independent measurement.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, FBI statements, and news outlets like The Guardian, BBC, and NBC News, confirm that Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University during a Turning Point USA event and died shortly thereafter. The claim directly matches these verified facts about the shooting and his death.

**Verification Notes:** The claim refers to alleged private messages from Charlie Kirk to Candace Owens on April 6, 2018, expressing a premonition of his death. No primary sources, such as the actual messages, news articles, or official statements from Turning Point USA, were found to confirm or refute this. Searches on the web and X (formerly Twitter) for references to these messages, premonitions, or dreams yielded no supporting evidence. Verification would require access to Kirk's private communications (e.g., via subpoena or release by TPUSA officials like Mikey McCoy) or independent corroboration from involved parties. The cited Wikipedia page on Kirk's 2025 assassination provides context on his life and death but does not mention any 2018 premonitions.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news outlets, including Hindustan Times, report that Candace Owens shared text messages from Charlie Kirk containing similar language about predicting his death and not living to see the end of the revolution, which aligns with parts of the transcript. However, the specific claim quote is from alleged private messages, and no primary evidence (e.g., screenshots, official statements from Turning Point USA, or independent verification) confirms authenticity. Verification would require access to Charlie Kirk's message archives, confirmation from Mikey McCoy (mentioned in the transcript), or a statement from Turning Point USA validating the texts. Ongoing disputes between Owens and TPUSA add uncertainty, but no direct refutation or confirmation of this exact phrase was found.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets or official statements from Turning Point USA, confirm the existence of text messages from Charlie Kirk sent the day before his death (September 9, 2025) explicitly stating that 'they' were going to kill him tomorrow, sent to TPUSA staff and security guards. Available reports discuss other leaked texts (e.g., about Israel positions 48 hours prior or prophecies from years earlier), but none match this specific claim. Posts on X echo Candace Owens' assertions but are inconclusive and not factual evidence. Verification would require release of the alleged private text messages, court documents from the ongoing Utah prosecution, or a FOIA request for FBI investigative records related to Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025.

Posts on X mention this detail and reference public records, but X posts are not conclusive evidence and may contain unverified claims. Additionally, the exact time of Charlie Kirk's assassination is not detailed in reliable sources, making the '1.5 hours before' aspect impossible to confirm. Verification would require access to Emmanuel Macron's official public calendar for September 10, 2025, or FOIA-requested records from French or U.S. government sources documenting the call, as well as precise timestamps from police reports or news archives on the assassination timing.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including this article from Times Now and others like Yahoo News, refute the claim by noting it stems from Candace Owens' conspiracy theory undermined by errors such as time zone confusion (mistaking UTC for Utah time). Official investigations from the FBI and prosecutors attribute the assassination solely to Tyler James Robinson acting alone, with no mention of Egyptian military involvement in primary sources like Wikipedia, PBS News, or FBI updates. No evidence from established news outlets or government statements supports the presence of Egyptian military men in Utah on September 10, 2025.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official FAA records, FlightRadar24 data, or government statements, were found to confirm the exact details of a plane departing Biggs Army Airfield at 6:13 a.m., dipping to 300 feet over Provo airport runway, and making a loop on September 10, 2025. Posts on X describe a similar military-related plane descending to around 200 feet over Provo on that date, but these are inconclusive and do not match the exact altitude or confirm the departure details. Verification would require access to official flight logs from the FAA, military records via FOIA request, or detailed tracking data from services like FlightRadar24 for the specific aircraft.

**Source:** [Video Footage of Shooter in Utah Valley University Shooting | Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/utah-valley-shooting-video-091025.mp4/view)
**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources, including FBI updates and news reports from CNN, PBS, and AP, confirm Charlie Kirk's assassination occurred around 12:00 p.m. MT on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Provo, Utah. However, no primary sources (e.g., news articles, official statements, or flight records) mention or confirm a plane 'dip' approximately 26 minutes later. Discussions on X/Twitter reference similar suspicious flight activity (e.g., low-altitude passes around 24-30 minutes post-shooting), but these are not conclusive evidence. Verification would require public flight tracking data from sources like FlightRadar24 or ADS-B Exchange, official FAA logs, or a FOIA request for air traffic control records from Provo Airport on that date, cross-referenced with the precise assassination timestamp from court or investigative documents.

**Source:** [N/A](N/A)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources (such as FAA registry, news articles, or official statements) were found confirming or refuting that the specific plane mentioned (which dipped low over Provo Airport) is owned by Lasai LLC. The claim originates from Candace Owens herself, but independent verification is lacking. To verify, access to FAA aircraft registration records, FlightRadar24 data linked to ownership, or a FOIA request for detailed flight logs would be required. Searches on the web and X yielded discussions of related planes (e.g., Egyptian jets or other private jets in Provo) but no direct evidence on Lasai LLC ownership.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, Fox News, CNN, and NPR, confirm that Tyler Robinson was the accused shooter who fired from a rooftop on the UVU campus, approximately 142 yards from the event. This directly contradicts the claim that he was not on the Woodbury Building (identified in reports as the sniper location) or on campus at all. The evidence includes official statements, court documents, and news reports detailing his path across campus and surrender to authorities.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources, including Latin Times, People, US Weekly, and Daily Mail, confirm that a private jet (tail number N888KG) owned by Derek Maxfield departed from Provo Airport shortly after the Charlie Kirk shooting on September 10, 2025, and later disappeared from tracking. However, none provide the exact departure time of 1:20 p.m. local time. Posts on X suggest times around 1:11-1:12 p.m. MDT (based on UTC conversions from flight tracking data), but these are inconclusive as X posts may contain unverified claims, especially for controversial topics. To verify the precise time, official flight logs from the FAA, Flightradar24, or airport records would be required, potentially via a FOIA request.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including PBS News, BBC, and FBI statements, confirm that suspect Tyler Robinson was arrested within days of the September 10, 2025, assassination, charged with the murder, and has appeared in court with prosecutors seeking the death penalty. This contradicts the claim that law enforcement efforts were not swift and successful in locating the killer, as an arrest occurred rapidly and the investigation led to charges.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources (e.g., news articles from established outlets like Yahoo News, Daily Mail, or official FBI statements) confirm or refute the specific claim that airport personnel were instructed to lie about the N888KG flight. Web searches and X posts discuss conspiracy theories around the flight but provide no evidence of such instructions; they focus on the jet's departure and transponder issues. The claim appears based on hearsay from the podcast. Verification would require internal airport or federal documents, such as FAA records, flight manifests, or FOIA requests for communications directing personnel to withhold or falsify information.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple established news outlets, including Hindustan Times, The Economic Times, and Times of India, report on Candace Owens' claim that an Egyptian Air Force plane (tail number SU-BTT) was present in Provo, Utah, arriving on September 4th and departing on September 10th. These reports reference flight tracking data from sources like FlightRadar, with no contradictions to the dates. Debunkings focus on time zone errors regarding the exact timing on September 10th relative to the assassination, not the arrival or departure dates themselves.

**Verification Notes:** Available news articles and X posts report on Candace Owens' claims about an Egyptian military plane (tail number SU-BTT) being in Provo, Utah, on September 10, 2025, with a prior trip to the US in July 2025. However, the specific assertion of 'only twice in the past year' prior to the September trip conflicts with initial reports (e.g., her own post claiming it was the 'first trip ever' in July) and later escalations in conspiracy theories mentioning multiple planes and up to 73 overlapping flights. No primary sources like official flight logs confirm the exact number of visits. Verification would require access to comprehensive flight records from sources such as FlightRadar24, FAA databases, or military aviation authorities, potentially obtainable via FOIA requests for international military flight details.

**Source:** [Candace Owens Screws Up Time Zones While Promoting Latest Charlie Kirk Conspiracy](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/candace-owens-screws-time-zones-122944083.html)
**Verification Notes:** The claim stems from conspiracy theories promoted by Candace Owens, with web sources and X posts echoing unverified allegations of Egyptian military subcontractors being dropped off in Provo on September 10. However, reliable news outlets report official investigations concluding the suspect acted alone, with debunkings focused on timing errors (e.g., time zone confusion). No primary sources, such as flight manifests or official passenger lists, confirm or refute the specific details about subcontractors. Verification would require access to FAA flight records, passenger manifests, or FOIA requests for aviation and investigative documents from U.S. authorities.

**Verification Notes:** The claim relies on an anonymous whistleblower cited by Candace Owens, with no publicly available primary evidence such as flight manifests, passenger lists, or official statements from the Egyptian government, FAA, or U.S. authorities confirming that military subcontractors were dropped off in Provo and did not return to Cairo. Web searches and X posts discuss the conspiracy theory but provide no verifiable documentation; articles report on Owens' allegations without independent confirmation and often highlight errors (e.g., time zone confusion). Verification would require access to confidential flight records, passenger manifests from the Egyptian Air Force, or FOIA requests to U.S. agencies like the FAA or DoD, which are not publicly available and may be classified due to the military nature of the flight.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple established news outlets, including The New York Times, Daily Mail, Hindustan Times, and Yahoo News, report that FBI Director Kash Patel pushed back against, clashed over, or shut down an inquiry by National Counterterrorism Center Director Joe Kent into potential foreign intelligence ties in Charlie Kirk's killing.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Source:** [N/A](N/A)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including news articles, official flight records, or government statements, were found mentioning a yellow plane with tail number SUBTT making a one-hour stopover in Minot, North Dakota, on September 4th (assuming 2025 based on context) before proceeding to Provo. Searches across web results and X posts yielded information on unrelated incidents, such as a July 2025 near-miss at Minot Airport and Egyptian jets in Provo on September 10th, but nothing matching the specific claim. Verification would require access to FAA flight logs, FlightAware or ADS-B tracking data, or official records from Minot International Airport/Minot AFB via FOIA request, which are not publicly available in the searched sources.

**Source:** [After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination, a Bumper Crop of Conspiracy Theories](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/us/charlie-kirk-assassination-conspiracy-theories.html)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources, including The New York Times, Axios, and The Guardian, report on Candace Owens promoting conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination, including claims of screenshots from group chats, but none provide independent verification of the screenshot's authenticity. Posts on X discuss Owens sharing the screenshot, but X content is not conclusive evidence. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., the assassination date around September 10, 2025, based on timeline in sources) with unverified ones (the chat's existence and content). Verification would require statements from chat participants (e.g., Rob McCoy or others named), digital forensic analysis of the screenshot, or official investigation records from law enforcement, such as FBI documents obtained via FOIA.

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [Brian Harpole - Groundbreaking Evidence From Charlie Kirk’s Head of Security | SRS #254 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0fmq1zffGw)
**Verification Notes:** The interview between Brian Harpole and Shawn Ryan (likely intended as 'Sean Ryan' in the claim) exists and is documented in multiple sources, including news articles from Deseret News and KSL.com that report on Harpole's recounting of events without labeling them as lies. However, posts on X (formerly Twitter) contain user accusations of specific lies (e.g., about a 'trap door,' EMT presence, or drones), but these are inconclusive opinions and not supported by established news outlets or official investigations. No primary sources like fact-check articles, official statements, or documents confirm or refute deception. Verification would require access to the full interview transcript, cross-referenced with police reports, video footage, or eyewitness accounts from the event (e.g., via FOIA requests to Orem PD or Utah authorities) to check specific statements against evidence.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources, including business announcements and aviation industry reports, confirm that Satys Aerospace (likely the 'Satis' referenced) is a legitimate French aerospace company expanding its aircraft painting and maintenance operations in Delaware, such as at Wilmington Airport. This directly contradicts the claim that it was not established for plane maintenance and is instead a front. No credible evidence supports the 'front' allegation; instead, posts on X and web sources describe routine aviation maintenance activities for Egyptian-registered planes, including partnerships with companies like Duncan Aviation and Boeing for fleet services.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles, official statements, or documents, confirm or refute the occurrence of a specific phone call from Charlie Kirk to Candace Owens instructing her to stop speaking about Brigitte Macron. The claim originates from Owens' podcast and is echoed in social media posts on X, but these are not conclusive evidence. Multiple searches across web results and X posts discuss Owens' broader conspiracy theories involving Kirk, the Macrons, and assassination plots, but none provide verifiable details on this private call. Verification would require access to phone records (e.g., via subpoena or FOIA request to telecom providers), text message logs shared publicly with authentication, or corroborating statements from Kirk's estate, associates, or other witnesses.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news outlets and posts on X report Candace Owens making this allegation in her podcast, including direct quotes matching the claim. However, the claim refers to a private phone conversation between Owens and Andrew Kolvet (likely misspelled as Kolvet), with no publicly available recording, transcript, or confirmation/denial from Kolvet specifically addressing this quote. Andrew Kolvet has denied other related claims by Owens (e.g., about Israeli links) as 'laughably untrue' in sources like Hindustan Times, but not this exact statement. Verification would require a recording of the call, call logs, or a direct statement from Kolvet or witnesses confirming the quote.

**Verification Notes:** The claim refers to a private phone conversation on September 10th, when Charlie Kirk was in the hospital after being shot, where Andrew Kolvet allegedly warned Candace Owens about a 'list' including her and Tucker Carlson, advising them to lay low. News sources, including this article, report Owens publicly questioning Kolvet about issuing such a warning after Kirk's death, but they do not provide independent evidence confirming the conversation occurred or its content. X posts and other web results confirm the date of Kirk's hospitalization and shooting as September 10th, but offer no corroboration of the specific warning. Verification would require statements from Kolvet, call logs, or other direct evidence of the interaction, which are not publicly available.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [FBI Wilmington Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/wilmington)
**Verification Notes:** The part of the claim stating that 920 King Street houses the DEA, FBI, and Secret Service is supported by reliable government sources: the FBI Wilmington Resident Agency is located at 920 N. King Street, Wilmington, DE, and cross-references confirm DEA and Secret Service offices share the same address in official directories. However, no primary sources (e.g., news articles, official flight records, or government statements) were found confirming an Egyptian plane with tail number SUBTT (likely SU-BTT) landing in a federally monitored hangar in Wilmington, Delaware, or a foreign dignitary being discreetly moved from there to 920 King Street. Posts on X and podcast transcripts discuss these elements as part of conspiracy theories, but they are not conclusive evidence. Verification would require access to FAA flight logs, ADS-B tracking data from sites like FlightRadar24, or FOIA requests for federal agency records on diplomatic movements and hangar activities.

**Verification Notes:** Available news articles and X posts confirm Candace Owens parted ways with the Daily Wire in late March 2024, with the public announcement on March 22, 2024, but no reliable sources specify an exact firing date of March 19, 2024, or confirm the Brigitte Macron episode aired precisely on March 13, 2024. One X post incorrectly suggests the episode was in March 2023, but most sources align with a March 2024 timeline for both events without exact dates. Verification would require access to internal Daily Wire employment records, official podcast publication logs, or timestamped episode archives from the Candace Owens Show.

**Source:** [IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE EMMANUEL MACRON and](https://clarelocke.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Complaint89.pdf)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources confirm the specific claim of receiving a cease-and-desist letter on December 3, 2024, as the first ever from Brigitte Macron and her lawyers. Available web results and X posts reference a defamation lawsuit filed in July 2025 and mention prior requests for retractions or a cease-and-desist in the case file, but none specify the December 3, 2024 date or confirm it as the first. Recent articles report on Owens' broader claims but do not independently verify this detail. To verify, access to the full lawsuit documents detailing dates of any cease-and-desist letters, or a copy of the letter itself with timestamp, would be required.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including Delaware Business Times and Delaware Business Now, confirm that on December 10, 2024, Satys Aerospace (noted as 'Satis' in the claim, likely a transcription error) publicly announced a two-year lease deal for a hangar near Wilmington Airport in Delaware. This aligns with the claim's timeline of seven days after December 3rd.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable external sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., The Times of India, Daily Mail, USA Today) or official statements, confirm or refute the specific claim of Charlie Kirk contacting Candace Owens on February 24, 2025, to relay a White House request to stop discussing Brigitte Macron. The claim involves a private communication, and while Owens has made public allegations about related conspiracies involving Macron, Kirk's death, and assassination attempts (as noted in Wikipedia and other news sources), this particular interaction is not independently documented. Verification would require access to private text messages, phone records, or official White House communications (e.g., via FOIA request), or corroborating statements from involved parties, which are not available in public records.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Reuters, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post, and official White House records, confirm that Donald Trump held a bilateral meeting with Emmanuel Macron on February 24, 2025, at the White House, focusing on issues like the Ukraine war. This directly supports the claim's specific date.

**Verification Notes:** The claim involves a private phone call between Sergio Gor and Candace Owens on February 25th (likely 2025 based on context), which is inherently difficult to verify without direct evidence from the parties involved. Web searches and X posts reference Owens' broader allegations about Brigitte Macron and related threats, but provide no independent confirmation or refutation of this specific call. Posts on X repeat similar claims (with spelling variations like 'Sergio Gore'), but these are not reliable evidence. To verify, access to phone records, call logs, or statements from Gor or the White House would be required; no such primary sources were found in available results.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news outlets, including Times of India, The Independent, BBC, and Deadline, report that Candace Owens claimed Trump called her in February to ask her to stop discussing Brigitte Macron. These sources confirm the general claim of a February call but do not specify the exact date of February 26th or provide independent verification (e.g., no statements from Trump or White House logs). The claim relies solely on Owens' account, with no corroborating evidence found. To verify, access to White House phone records, Trump's personal call logs, or a deposition from the ongoing Macron defamation lawsuit against Owens would be required, as these could confirm or refute the private call.

This falls within the claimed period of July 20th to 26th. The RT post on X explicitly attributes the reporting to the Financial Times, supporting that the information was released or reported during that timeframe.

**Verification Notes:** News articles from reliable outlets like The Salt Lake Tribune and Fox News report that Brian Harpole texted or raised concerns with UVU Police Chief Jeff Long about rooftop security, implying the communication was Harpole's. However, posts on X (formerly Twitter) claim the text exchange was actually between Dan Flood (a Turning Point USA security member) and Chief Long, aligning with the podcast claim. There are no primary sources, such as the actual text messages, screenshots with sender details, or official statements from Harpole, Flood, or Long, to confirm who sent the messages. Discrepancies between news reports and social media sentiment make it impossible to verify without access to the original texts or confirming documents, which could be obtained via FOIA requests to UVU or police records.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news outlets, including KUTV and NPR affiliates, report that surveillance footage of Tyler Robinson turning himself in at the Washington County Sheriff’s Office is missing or no longer available, citing a 30-day retention period in responses to public records requests. This supports the claim directly, with no contradicting evidence found in reliable sources.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including BBC and ABC News, report on text messages from court documents between Tyler Robinson and his roommate detailing events around the UVU shooting. The specific quote aligns with reported exchanges about retrieving the weapon and encountering police, as described in official statements and charging documents released by authorities.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple established news outlets, including Daily Mail, Newsweek, and The Times of India, report on the text messages between Tyler Robinson and Lance Twiggs, with details matching the quoted phrases 'I worry about prints' and 'I had to leave it in a bush where I changed outfits.' These reports are based on court documents and prosecutor revelations, supporting that the claim accurately reflects the content of the alleged texts, though some interpretations question their authenticity.

**Verification Notes:** The claim relies on anonymous emails from locals to Candace Owens alleging federal pressure not to share footage. News sources report on Owens' statements about missing or suppressed footage in the Charlie Kirk case, including FBI denials of requests for surveillance video, but no primary evidence (e.g., official statements, documents, or direct accounts from locals) independently confirms or refutes that federal agents specifically instructed locals not to share footage. Verification would require public statements from the locals, FBI internal communications obtained via FOIA, or investigative journalism corroborating the interactions.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Newsweek and Times Now, confirm that Candace Owens released a clear image purporting to show Tyler Robinson at a Dairy Queen in Orem at 6:38 p.m. after the shooting, matching the podcast claim. However, the image is unverified by law enforcement, and official sources have not confirmed its authenticity, timestamp, or that it depicts Robinson at that exact time. Fact-checks address related theories but do not debunk the image's existence, only specific interpretations. Verification would require official confirmation from Utah police, Dairy Queen surveillance records, or court documents via FOIA.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including Free Press Journal, Times Now, and Newsweek, consistently describe the photo shared by Candace Owens as depicting Tyler Robinson wearing a maroon shirt and jeans at a Dairy Queen, matching the claim's description of the attire in the image. While the photo's authenticity and timing are debated as unverified in some reports, the specific claim about the clothing shown in the photo is supported across sources.

**Source:** [Was Tyler Robinson At Dairy Queen After Charlie Kirk Shooting? What We Know - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/tyler-robinson-dairy-queen-charlie-kirk-2132434)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple established news outlets, including Newsweek, Times Now, and Yahoo, report on Candace Owens' podcast claim that the Dairy Queen is about a 17-minute drive from the campus where the Charlie Kirk shooting occurred on September 10, 2025. However, these sources primarily reiterate the claim without providing independent verification of the driving time, such as map calculations or official location details. Posts found on X also mention the 17-minute drive, reflecting public sentiment around the conspiracy theory, but X posts are inconclusive for factual verification, especially on controversial topics. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., existence of a photo and locations in Orem, Utah) with unconfirmed interpretation (exact driving time). To verify, access to precise addresses of the campus shooting site and the specific Dairy Queen, along with tools like Google Maps for real-time driving estimates, would be required; no such primary evidence was found in available sources.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources were found confirming the exact date or time of the neighbor interview clip referenced in the claim. TMZ published the footage of the person of interest on September 11, 2025, in the evening (22:38), which is the day after the assassination on September 10, 2025. If the interview clip was indeed from the morning of September 11, the claim that TMZ had already publicized the footage by then would be false, but without confirmation of the clip's timing, the claim cannot be verified. Verification would require access to the original news broadcast or article containing the Samuel Steele interview, including its publication or air date.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles, official documents, or government records, were found to confirm or refute the claim that virtually everyone on a specific block in Orem, Utah, works for Caldera Engineering or that the Steeles are a big family in Orem. The company's website and related business profiles confirm Caldera Engineering exists in nearby Provo, Utah, and manufactures valves, but provide no details on employee residences or family connections. X posts echo similar rumors but are not reliable evidence. Verification would require access to property records from Utah County assessor's office, Caldera Engineering's employee directories, or local census data via FOIA requests to confirm neighborhood employment patterns and family prominence.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including news articles from established outlets (e.g., BBC as mentioned in the transcript), official statements, or public records, were found mentioning a Sherry Steele as a resident of any building complex in Orem, Utah, in connection with the Charlie Kirk shooting. Multiple search strategies across web results and X posts yielded no evidence of her existence, footage, or involvement. Verification would require access to private resident databases, property records from Utah County, voter registration logs, or FOIA requests for police reports and witness statements related to the incident. The absence of any public documentation for a purported witness in a high-profile assassination suggests the claim cannot be confirmed or refuted without these restricted sources.

Eyewitness accounts and video footage described in news reports indicate that people in the audience saw the shooting occur instantly, with Kirk slumping in his chair and bleeding profusely from the neck wound.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., CNN, Fox News, NYT) or official statements from law enforcement, confirm the gun was found in a backyard by a chicken coop. The claim appears to originate from local rumors and conspiracy theories discussed on podcasts and social media, with some posts on X mentioning 'woods' as the recovery location instead. Multiple searches across web results yield details on the shooting and suspect's path but no specifics on a chicken coop. Verification would require access to official police reports, evidence logs, or court documents from the Utah County prosecutor's office detailing the exact gun recovery site.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official police reports, news articles from established outlets, or property records, confirm or refute the claim of a mysteriously vacant university-owned home next to the gun's recovery site. Web searches and X posts mention the gun being found 'in the woods' or at a 'drop point' near Utah Valley University, with some unverified social media speculation about a chicken coop, but nothing addresses a adjacent university-owned vacant home. Verification would require access to official investigative documents (e.g., Washington County Sheriff's Office reports), property ownership records from local assessor's office or university disclosures, or FOIA requests for detailed crime scene maps.

These theories are described as baseless and antisemitic by established outlets, supporting Netanyahu's claim that such accusations are fabricated lies. Official denials from Netanyahu and lack of evidence for the theories further corroborate this.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news outlets, including The Times of Israel, Newsweek, and The Jewish Chronicle, confirm the existence of the letter from Charlie Kirk to Benjamin Netanyahu dated May, and report Netanyahu quoting from it with phrases matching or closely aligning with the claim (e.g., expressing joy in advocating for Israel and forming alliances to defend/protect Judeo-Christian civilization). The full letter, revealed in sources like Newsweek, supports Kirk's pro-Israel stance, corroborating the quoted sentiment despite minor wording variations in reports.

**Verification Notes:** A fact-check article and other news reports from reliable outlets like The Times of Israel and Israel Hayom confirm that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended a personal invitation to Charlie Kirk to visit Israel shortly before his death in September 2025. While some sources attribute a similar invitation to Minister Amichai Chikli for a January conference, the fact-check specifically verifies Netanyahu's involvement, supporting the claim of a conversation and invitation a few weeks prior. The exact details of the 'speech' (e.g., phone call vs. other communication) are not contradicted but not fully detailed in all sources, leading to medium confidence.

> Yesterday, the FBI made a rather curious announcement. They announced that they were going to cut ties with the ADL.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Source:** [FBI cuts ties with Anti-Defamation League, FBI director says | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-cuts-ties-with-anti-defamation-league-2025-10-01/)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including Reuters, AP News, Fox News, and Al Jazeera, confirm that the FBI announced cutting ties with the ADL on or around October 1, 2025, due to criticisms of the ADL's extremism glossary including Charlie Kirk's organization. However, this announcement did not occur 'yesterday' relative to the current date of December 7, 2025; the timing element is inaccurate, while the core fact of the announcement is supported.

### [INSANITY! Guess Who Kash Patel Sent To Investigate Charli... @ 00:02:02](/episodes/ep-t1YtLS1n8Vs.md#^t-00-01-24)

> The reality is the ADL was born out of a Jewish Freemason organization known as B'nai B'rith.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Source:** [Anti-Defamation League - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Britannica, ADL's official history page, and Wikipedia, confirm that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was founded in 1913 by the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish service organization, initially as the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. This supports the claim that the ADL was 'born out of' B'nai B'rith, which is Jewish. However, while B'nai B'rith was founded in 1843 with a fraternal structure inspired by Freemasonry and some founders were Freemasons, it is not officially a Freemason organization but rather an independent Jewish fraternal group. The 'Freemason' label is an interpretive exaggeration not directly supported by primary sources like official histories or encyclopedias, which describe it as a Jewish service or fraternal organization.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including academic articles from PubMed, PEP-Web, and historical archives from the Center for Jewish History, confirm that Sigmund Freud was a member of the B'nai B'rith organization in Vienna from 1897 until 1938. He delivered lectures and addresses to the group, as documented in primary texts and scholarly analyses.

> They put the organization together to defend a pedophile and a murderer. His name is Leo Frank.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Source:** [Leo Frank - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Frank)
**Verification Notes:** The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was founded in October 1913 by B'nai B'rith, and its announcement by Adolf Kraus explicitly mentioned the Leo Frank case as an example of anti-Semitism, supporting the claim that the organization was formed in response to his trial. However, the ADL's broader mission was to combat defamation against Jews, not solely to defend Frank personally. Regarding Frank being a 'pedophile and a murderer,' he was convicted of murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan in 1913, with allegations of sexual assault, but the conviction was for murder only (no rape charge was upheld), and his guilt remains highly disputed—many sources, including a 1986 posthumous pardon by Georgia, suggest innocence due to anti-Semitic bias in the trial and evidence pointing to another suspect (Jim Conley). Multiple reliable sources (e.g., Britannica, New Georgia Encyclopedia) confirm the ADL's founding link to the case but note debates over Frank's guilt, making the claim a mix of accurate historical context and contested interpretation.

### [INSANITY! Guess Who Kash Patel Sent To Investigate Charli... @ 00:03:31](/episodes/ep-t1YtLS1n8Vs.md#^t-00-02-47)

> Leo Frank was an unbelievably wealthy Jewish factory owner down in Atlanta. And this is 1913. Mary Phagan was a 13-year-old girl who worked at his pencil factory. She was found brutally raped.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Source:** [Leo Frank - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Frank)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, New Georgia Encyclopedia, and History.com, confirm Leo Frank was a Jewish superintendent (not owner) of the National Pencil Company in Atlanta in 1913; Mary Phagan was a 13-year-old employee who was found strangled and sexually molested in the factory basement on April 26, 1913. The claim accurately states the year, location, Phagan's age, her employment, and that she was found raped/sexually assaulted. However, Frank was not the factory owner (he managed it) and descriptions of him as 'unbelievably wealthy' are exaggerated—he was a well-connected businessman but not extraordinarily so. Posts on X reflect ongoing debates but align with historical accounts of assault.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** True (high)
**Source:** [Leo Frank Case - New Georgia Encyclopedia](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/leo-frank-case/)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including historical encyclopedias and academic accounts, confirm that Leo Frank was tried and convicted by a jury in Fulton County Superior Court in 1913 for the murder of Mary Phagan. The guilty verdict was reached on August 25, 1913, despite attempts by the defense to implicate others, such as the factory janitor Jim Conley.

> The FBI director, Kash Patel, announced yesterday that he ended—he has—this is over.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** True (high)
**Source:** [Kash Patel pulls the plug on ADL’s FBI training on extremism - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/01/kash-patel-pulls-the-plug-on-adls-fbi-training-on-extremism-00591105)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple established news outlets, including Politico, Reuters, USA Today, and Newsweek, reported on October 1, 2025, that FBI Director Kash Patel announced the termination of the FBI's training and intelligence-sharing partnership with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Patel made the announcement via a social media post, criticizing the ADL for spying on Americans and its ties to former Director James Comey. The timing of 'yesterday' in the claim is relative to the podcast episode and aligns with the reported announcement date in sources.

### [INSANITY! Guess Who Kash Patel Sent To Investigate Charli... @ 00:09:33](/episodes/ep-t1YtLS1n8Vs.md#^t-00-09-05)

**Verification Notes:** The claim's phrase 'love letters' is a metaphorical expression used by FBI Director Kash Patel in his announcement, not literal letters, but it reflects documented praise from Comey, such as his 2014 speech to the ADL where he highlighted their partnership and training of 47,000 law enforcement officers. The 'embedded FBI agents' element is supported by reports of a formal FBI-ADL partnership under Comey involving intelligence sharing and agent training, as confirmed in multiple outlets including Fox News, Newsweek, and historical ADL-FBI collaborations; however, 'love letters' adds interpretive exaggeration.

### [INSANITY! Guess Who Kash Patel Sent To Investigate Charli... @ 00:11:09](/episodes/ep-t1YtLS1n8Vs.md#^t-00-10-35)

**Source:** [The ADL issues statement declaring Ukraine’s Azov Battalion no longer ‘far-right’](https://thegrayzone.com/2022/12/08/adl-ukraines-azov-battalion-far-right/)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including reports from The Grayzone and ADL's own communications, confirm that in November 2022, the ADL issued a statement defending the Azov Battalion, stating it had been reformed after integration into the Ukrainian National Guard and no longer exhibited far-right influences. This change in stance effectively removes it from being classified as a hate or far-right group by the ADL, supporting the claim of removal from their 'hate list' (referring to tracked extremist entities).

**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [X Post by Kyle - Undercover (2023)](https://x.com/kyleisbased/status/1699406224570343851)
**Verification Notes:** No primary sources such as official property records, news articles from established outlets, or statements from the ADL or FBI were found to confirm or refute the claim of shared office space in Connecticut. The claim appears to originate from social media posts on X, which cite unspecified property records but do not provide them. Web searches yielded results about the FBI cutting ties with the ADL in 2025, but nothing on shared spaces. To verify, access to official Connecticut property records, ADL/FBI office directories, or a FOIA request for federal building occupancy details would be required. X posts are inconclusive and cannot serve as reliable evidence.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including FBI press releases, Wikipedia, and news outlets like NBC, CNN, and CBS, confirm FBI involvement in the investigation of Charlie Kirk's assassination at UVU, assisted by the Utah Department of Public Safety and ATF. However, no sources specify or mention the Connecticut field office being sent or involved. Posts on X discuss FBI agents at the scene but do not reference Connecticut. To verify this specific claim, access to internal FBI deployment records, official statements on field office assignments, or a FOIA request to the FBI for investigation team details would be required. The lack of mention in extensive coverage suggests this detail may not be publicly documented.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., ABC News, NBC News, Wikipedia) or official statements from the Orem Police Department, were found confirming or refuting that a witness named Bishop works as a records specialist there. Searches for witnesses to the Charlie Kirk assassination yielded details on other individuals (e.g., Skyler Baird) but not Bishop in this role. Verification would require access to Orem Police Department employment records, a FOIA request for personnel files, or confirmatory reporting from credible news sources linking her to the department.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources including Wikipedia and Ballotpedia provide comprehensive lists of candidates who ran in the 2024 Utah gubernatorial election, including those in primaries, conventions, and the general election. Scott Robbins is mentioned in the Wikipedia article in a list that appears to be endorsers or related figures (e.g., alongside Jason Chaffetz and Robert O'Brien), but not as a candidate who declared, filed, or participated in the race. No news articles, official filings, or government records confirm he ran for governor; his absence from candidate lists contradicts the claim.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including a 2025 law directory entry and campaign website, confirm Greg Skordas is running for Utah Attorney General, a position that serves as the state's top legal officer and prosecutor. This aligns with the claim of running as a 'state prosecutor,' as the AG role involves prosecutorial duties at the state level. Additional sources like Deseret News (2020) and Ballotpedia corroborate his history of running for this office, with recent information indicating an active 2025 campaign.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news outlets (e.g., France 24, Euronews, Daily Mail) report on Owens' public claim of being contacted by a high-ranking French government employee on or around November 20, 2025, but emphasize that no evidence has been provided to support the contact or the alleged information shared. French media and officials have dismissed the broader assassination plot as false or unsubstantiated. The claim of the contact itself is a personal assertion without independent verification, such as communication records or whistleblower confirmation.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news outlets, including Euronews, Jerusalem Post, and Times of India, report on Candace Owens' claims of a $1.5 million payment by Macron for assassins (one Israeli, one French-Canadian) routed through an elite club (variously reported as 'Club des Cent' or similar to 'club des Saints'), but all emphasize that no evidence or official confirmation has been provided. The claim remains unsubstantiated allegations amid a defamation lawsuit. Verification would require access to French government financial records, bank transfer documents, or investigative reports from authorities like the FBI (to which Owens reportedly submitted claims), potentially obtainable via FOIA requests or court proceedings.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including IBTimes UK, Daily Mail, and CNN, cover Candace Owens' allegations of a French state-backed plot against her, including claims involving President Macron. However, none report any official response or statement issued directly by the Élysée Palace addressing these specific claims. A separate report mentions a French Ministry dismissing related allegations over a spelling error, but this is not attributed to the Élysée Palace itself. The absence of any documented response from the Élysée Palace supports the claim that their official response is 'nothing'.

**Verification Notes:** Official U.S. Air Force sources, including from Minot Air Force Base and U.S. Strategic Command, confirm that Operation Valhalla Strike was a real training exercise held at Camp Ripley, Minnesota, from August 24-29, 2025, involving personnel from the 891st Missile Security Forces Squadron at Minot AFB. This supports the claim's elements of location, Minot AFB involvement, and the name 'Operation Valhalla' (full name is 'Valhalla Strike'). However, the dates are inaccurate—the exercise ran until August 29, not August 27, and was about six days long, not 'a couple of days.' No reliable sources mention it as a 'joint exercise with civilians'; this appears to be an unsubstantiated interpretation, though some unverified social media posts on X speculate about civilian involvement. Multiple government and military news outlets corroborate the core facts but refute or omit the civilian and exact date claims.

However, conflicting information from X posts and other checks indicate it was #1 only briefly on Podscribe (which may not filter fake engagement), and overall rankings (e.g., on Spotify or general charts) show it lower, with Joe Rogan as #1, making the absolute 'number one in the world' claim inaccurate or overstated.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including ABC News, NBC News, and The Guardian, confirm that Australian Immigration Minister Tony Burke denied Candace Owens a visa in October 2024, effectively banning her from entering the country for a speaking tour. The decision was based on character grounds and concerns she could incite discord. Australia's High Court upheld the ban in October 2025.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official medical examiner reports, court documents, or statements from investigators, publicly confirm or refute whether Erika Kirk has seen the autopsy report or specific evidence portions in the Charlie Kirk assassination case. An autopsy is standard for homicides under Utah law, and evidence like DNA matches and shell casings has been reported in news outlets, but details of family access are not disclosed. The claim originates from Erika Kirk's own statement in a Jesse Watters interview, as noted in social media and news discussions. Verification would require FOIA requests for medical examiner records, court filings from the prosecution against Tyler Robinson, or official statements confirming what evidence was shared with the family.

News articles and X posts confirm Owens' frequent involvement in TPUSA events from 2018 to 2024, but lack quantifiable data on who headlined the most.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable news sources like Yahoo Finance and Fortune report that Turning Point USA had $85 million in revenue from a network of 500,000 donors following Charlie Kirk's death in September 2025, indicating a significant surge in donations post-death. Additional sources from The Guardian and Newsweek confirm increased fundraising and donations after the event, with one mentioning a $1 million pledge. Posts on X also reference figures around $80-90 million in the weeks following his death, supporting the claim's approximation of $90 million in that timeframe. Prior revenue was lower (e.g., $39.2 million in 2020), suggesting the jump includes post-death contributions. The claim is supported as an approximate figure, though exact timing and breakdown are not fully detailed in primary sources.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including Fox News, CBN News, and Church Leaders, confirm Frank Turek was a few feet away from Charlie Kirk during the assassination at Utah Valley University, was wearing a white hat, ducked down after the shot, helped load Kirk into an SUV, and accompanied him to the hospital while performing CPR. Posts on X further corroborate these details from eyewitness accounts and videos.

> Thomas Michael Camino, 31 years old, of San Juan Capistrano, was convicted in May of molesting an eight-year-old girl and trying to lure a dozen others into sexual encounters by asking for help finding his cat. Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Richard M. Aronson imposed the maximum term [eight-year sentence].

**Verification Notes:** Multiple LA Times articles from 1995 confirm the conviction in May, molestation of an 8-year-old girl, attempts to lure over a dozen children using a lost cat story, and an 8-year maximum sentence imposed by Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Richard M. Aronson on Thomas Michael Cimino, aged 31, from San Juan Capistrano. The claim accurately describes these events but incorrectly spells the last name as 'Camino' instead of 'Cimino'.

> Despite his conviction, despite having spent years in prison for these crimes, Rob McCoy... struck up thereafter and maintained a long friendship with Thomas Camino across decades... Rob then decides that Camino should be involved in the Calvary Chapel Church... that Camino should have access to young children in a program called Home Fellowship, which put him inside the homes of children.

**Source:** [The rise of Newbury Park Pastor Rob McCoy](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2022/10/05/godspeak-newbury-park-pastor-rob-mccoy/8182148001/)
**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as news articles, court documents, or official statements, were found in the provided web results to confirm or refute the specific claim about Rob McCoy's long-term friendship with Thomas Camino post-conviction, or Camino's alleged involvement in the Calvary Chapel Church's Home Fellowship program granting access to children in 2022. The linked source is a 2022 news article profiling McCoy but does not mention Camino or the controversy. Posts on X discuss similar allegations stemming from the podcast, but they are not reliable evidence and reflect public sentiment rather than verified facts. To verify, would require access to 2022 news archives (e.g., local California outlets like VC Star or LA Times), court records of Camino's conviction, or official church statements/records from Calvary Chapel regarding the Home Fellowship program and any related controversies.

**Source:** [Pastor Bob Coy of Calvary Chapel accused of molesting 4-year-old | Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article184564528.html)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Miami Herald, Miami New Times, The Independent, and Christian Post, confirm that Bob Coy, founder of Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale (which originated in Pompano Beach, Florida), was accused in 2017 of molesting a 4-year-old girl and continuing the abuse into her teens. The claim accurately describes the accusation and location but incorrectly names the pastor as 'Rob Coy' instead of 'Bob Coy'; no sources refer to a 'Rob Coy' in this context. Wikipedia and other outlets note no charges were filed, but the accusation led to his firing from a subsequent job.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including news outlets like The Roys Report and MinistryWatch, confirm that Bruce Hollen, lead pastor of Calvary Chapel of the Woodlands, was arrested in May 2024 on charges related to possession of child pornography (a form of online sex abuse against children) and later sentenced to prison. However, no sources describe the arrest as resulting from a 'sting operation'; it appears to have stemmed from a standard investigation into child pornography possession, making that specific detail inaccurate.

Like this wasn't just Brigitte and Emmanuel sitting down making a mistake by filing this cross-national lawsuit, but rather federal agencies which may have been colluding and speaking to one another about how to put an end to my research into who Brigitte was, because all of these governments are implicated. And by all of them, I mean France, the United States, and Israel implicated

### [Who Ordered The Hit On Charlie Kirk? | Candace Ep 237 @ 00:07:35](/episodes/ep-2WEHTk0Xewg.md#^t-00-07-18)

> George Zinn announced as suspect in custody by Utah police 30 minutes after the shooting

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** False (high)
**Source:** [George Zinn, arrested on suspicion of obstruction after Charlie Kirk shooting, is widely known Utah political ‘gadfly’](https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/10/george-zinn-what-we-know-about-man/)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including the Salt Lake Tribune (published approximately 4.5 hours after the shooting), The Hill, BBC, and others, report on George Zinn's arrest and role, with publication times starting several hours post-shooting (shooting at 12:23 p.m. MT on September 10, 2025). No primary sources, such as official Utah police statements or news reports, indicate an announcement 30 minutes after the shooting; official details emerged later, contradicting the claim's timeline.

**Type:** Factual

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including PBS, NBC, CBS, BBC, NPR, ABC, and CNBC, report on Governor Cox's statements and interviews following the Charlie Kirk shooting, focusing on a single suspect in custody with no mention of a second suspect or any description of dark clothing. One source explicitly notes authorities' confidence that the suspect acted alone, contradicting the claim of a second suspect being mentioned in any press conference.

### [The Great Exodus From Utah? Where Did The "Egyptians" Go ... @ 00:01:15](/episodes/ep-581dILVcEE4.md#^t-00-00-44)

> the filing deadline, if you file for an extension—which we can assume Turning Point did—was November 15th for this year

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** False (high)
**Source:** [Turning Point Usa Inc - Nonprofit Explorer - ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/800835023)
**Verification Notes:** ProPublica provides access to Turning Point USA's historical IRS Form 990 filings, which show a fiscal year ending June 30 (confirmed by posts found on X referencing filings like the one covering July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021). Per IRS rules, for a fiscal year ending June 30, the original Form 990 due date is November 15 of the same year, and filing for a 6-month extension moves the deadline to May 15 of the following year. The claim incorrectly states that the deadline with an extension is November 15, which is actually the original deadline without extension. No evidence was found of a change in fiscal year to make November 15 the extended date.

### [BREAKING NEWS: FBI Pressuring Utah To Close The Charlie K... @ 00:05:50](/episodes/ep-QZWSsq8ZWzw.md#^t-00-05-35)

> Tyler Robinson has not confessed to anything

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** False (medium)
**Source:** [Charlie Kirk: Tyler Robinson never went to Utah Valley University, disliked gun? Stunning twist in Charlie Kirk assassination plot - The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/us-news-candace-owens-tyler-robinson-never-went-to-utah-valley-university-disliked-gun-new-bombshell-in-charlie-kirk-assassination/articleshow/124248415.cms)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources and posts on X report that Tyler Robinson confessed or implied involvement to family members, leading to his surrender, as detailed in official affidavits and statements from Utah authorities. While he has not confessed to authorities directly and is not cooperating, the claim that he has not confessed 'to anything' is contradicted by these accounts of confessions to family.

### [Charlie Kirk And The Crossing Of The Delaware | Candace E... @ 00:11:00](/episodes/ep-SKGUzGHymcI.md#^t-00-10-15)

> Today, if you punch that address into public directories, you will find the DEA, Drug Enforcement Agency, at 920 North King Street, and at the same address, the United States Secret Service, 920 North King Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** False (medium)
**Source:** [Contact Us - Richards, Layton & Finger](https://www.rlf.com/contact-us/)
**Verification Notes:** The address 920 North King Street in Wilmington, Delaware, is confirmed as the location of Richards, Layton & Finger, a private law firm, based on their official website. No primary sources, such as official government directories or websites for the DEA or Secret Service, list these agencies at this address in the search results. Posts found on X suggest the agencies may be at a different location (e.g., 500 Delaware Avenue), but this information is treated as inconclusive due to the controversial nature of the topic. The claim that public directories currently show the DEA and Secret Service at this address is not supported and appears incorrect.

### [Charlie Kirk And The Crossing Of The Delaware | Candace E... @ 00:15:30](/episodes/ep-SKGUzGHymcI.md#^t-00-14-53)

> When you Google FBI Wilmington Resident Agency, you should check the address in the Google info panel. You will likely get 920 North King Street with the label Federal Bureau of Investigation.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** False (medium)
**Source:** [Field Offices | Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)
**Verification Notes:** The official FBI website lists field offices but does not specify 920 North King Street as the address for the Wilmington Resident Agency. Provided web search results for the query including 'Google info panel' do not show or confirm that Google displays this address. Multiple X posts from users who conducted Google searches and contacted the Baltimore FBI office (which oversees Delaware) state that no Google results show FBI offices at 920 North King Street, and the actual address is 500 Delaware Avenue. One post notes the FBI moved from North King Street some time ago. This contradicts the claim that Google will likely show 920 North King Street.

### [INFILTRATION: Charlie Kirk Was Being Tracked For Years. |... @ 00:06:10](/episodes/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0.md#^t-00-05-35)

> there was another Egyptian plane that left three hours after—Egyptian military plane that is—three hours after Charlie Kirk was assassinated from Provo, Utah... three days after Charlie Kirk was assassinated—that's when the rest of the Egyptian crew, whoever was on that plane, departed Provo

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** False (medium)
**Source:** [Who Does Candace Owens Think Killed Charlie Kirk? Ex-TPUSA Member Pushes ‘Egyptian Air Force’ Theory | US News - Times Now](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/who-does-candace-owens-think-killed-charlie-kirk-ex-tpusa-member-pushes-egyptian-air-force-theory-article-152989540)
**Verification Notes:** The claim about an Egyptian military plane (tail number SU-BND) departing Provo, Utah, three days after Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025, is contradicted by reliable news sources reporting that similar allegations by Candace Owens were debunked due to her confusion of UTC with local Utah time. No primary sources, such as FAA flight records or official statements, confirm any Egyptian military planes departing Provo around that date; instead, reports treat these as unsubstantiated conspiracy theories facing backlash. Verification would require access to official FAA or FlightAware flight logs for September 13, 2025, at Provo Airport (PVU).

### [INFILTRATION: Charlie Kirk Was Being Tracked For Years. |... @ 00:20:57](/episodes/ep-YFmRH8p5lt0.md#^t-00-20-27)

> Turning Point USA on February 11th... starts a chapter in Lincoln, Nebraska

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** False (medium)
**Source:** [With a faculty adviser lined up, UNL prepared to recognize Turning Point USA chapter](https://journalstar.com/news/local/education/with-a-faculty-adviser-lined-up-unl-prepared-to-recognize/article_9e4003fd-bae9-52fe-874f-c3593ab2fdaf.html)
**Verification Notes:** A September 2025 news article from the Lincoln Journal Star reports that Turning Point USA planned to establish a chapter at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2024, but those plans were put on hold due to a protest that escalated into a political crisis. The university was only prepared to recognize the chapter in 2025 after securing a faculty adviser. This directly contradicts the claim of starting a chapter on February 11, 2024. No reliable sources, including official TPUSA announcements or news reports, were found confirming a chapter start on that specific date in 2024, though an earlier chapter formation was reported in 2018.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news outlets, including NBC, NPR, ABC, CBS, POLITICO, and Axios, report that on December 4, 2025, the FBI arrested Brian J. Cole, a Virginia man, in connection with the January 5, 2021, pipe bombs near DNC and RNC headquarters. The claim appears to stem from a November 2025 Blaze Media report alleging a forensic match to former Capitol Police officer Shauni Rae Kerkhoff (similar to the named 'Shawna Rae Kirkhoff'), but Blaze Media retracted this report on December 4, 2025, after the official arrest. Snopes also confirms the retraction and the charging of Cole, contradicting the claim.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including news articles or official statements, confirm that a CIA spokeswoman named Liz Lyon made any statement about Shawna Rae Kirkhoff (or similar spellings like Shauni Rae Kerkhoff) working in Capitol Police Campus Security or living in Alexandria, Virginia. Searches for primary sources yielded reports about Kerkhoff from outlets like Blaze Media, which later retracted its claims linking her to the Jan. 6 pipe bombs after federal authorities charged Brian J. Cole instead. X posts mention Kerkhoff's background but attribute it to investigative reports, not a CIA spokeswoman. The absence of any evidence for Liz Lyon's statement across multiple sources indicates the claim is contradicted or fabricated.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, NYT, CNN, and LA Times, confirm the shooter in the 2018 Thousand Oaks Borderline Bar incident was Ian David Long, a 28-year-old Marine veteran, who acted alone and died by suicide. There is no evidence that his mother was involved in the shooting, directly contradicting the claim. No primary sources (news articles, official statements) support a friendship or family connection between Rob McCoy and Ian David Long or his family; searches for such links yield only unsubstantiated social media speculation, making that part unverifiable but not altering the false core attribution of the shooting to the mother.

**Verification Notes:** Searches of Caldera Engineering's website (calderaengineering.com) and related pages do not reveal any map showing engineering projects by country, nor any mention of work in Israel or dots representing projects there. Multiple site pages, including About Us, History, and Engineering sections, were reviewed with no reference to Israel or such a map. Additional searches for variations like project maps or international collaborations also yielded no supporting evidence, contradicting the claim.

The video shows Mikey McCoy turning and walking away less than a second after the shot, on his phone, without any blood on him or checking on Charlie Kirk, refuting the claim of an immediate call to his father describing the shooting in the neck and requesting prayers. Posts on X further highlight this timeline discrepancy, with sources agreeing the pastor's version is inaccurate.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including this article from Times Now and others like Yahoo News, refute the claim by noting it stems from Candace Owens' conspiracy theory undermined by errors such as time zone confusion (mistaking UTC for Utah time). Official investigations from the FBI and prosecutors attribute the assassination solely to Tyler James Robinson acting alone, with no mention of Egyptian military involvement in primary sources like Wikipedia, PBS News, or FBI updates. No evidence from established news outlets or government statements supports the presence of Egyptian military men in Utah on September 10, 2025.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, Fox News, CNN, and NPR, confirm that Tyler Robinson was the accused shooter who fired from a rooftop on the UVU campus, approximately 142 yards from the event. This directly contradicts the claim that he was not on the Woodbury Building (identified in reports as the sniper location) or on campus at all. The evidence includes official statements, court documents, and news reports detailing his path across campus and surrender to authorities.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including PBS News, BBC, and FBI statements, confirm that suspect Tyler Robinson was arrested within days of the September 10, 2025, assassination, charged with the murder, and has appeared in court with prosecutors seeking the death penalty. This contradicts the claim that law enforcement efforts were not swift and successful in locating the killer, as an arrest occurred rapidly and the investigation led to charges.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources, including business announcements and aviation industry reports, confirm that Satys Aerospace (likely the 'Satis' referenced) is a legitimate French aerospace company expanding its aircraft painting and maintenance operations in Delaware, such as at Wilmington Airport. This directly contradicts the claim that it was not established for plane maintenance and is instead a front. No credible evidence supports the 'front' allegation; instead, posts on X and web sources describe routine aviation maintenance activities for Egyptian-registered planes, including partnerships with companies like Duncan Aviation and Boeing for fleet services.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources including Wikipedia and Ballotpedia provide comprehensive lists of candidates who ran in the 2024 Utah gubernatorial election, including those in primaries, conventions, and the general election. Scott Robbins is mentioned in the Wikipedia article in a list that appears to be endorsers or related figures (e.g., alongside Jason Chaffetz and Robert O'Brien), but not as a candidate who declared, filed, or participated in the race. No news articles, official filings, or government records confirm he ran for governor; his absence from candidate lists contradicts the claim.

**Verification Notes:** Official U.S. State Department guidelines confirm that foreign state aircraft, including military jets, require diplomatic clearance to enter and operate in U.S. airspace, ensuring federal government awareness and approval. Multiple sources, including FAA and DoD documents, support that such landings are monitored and cannot occur without attention. However, the claim's assertion of a required 'federal escort' (implying physical or airborne accompaniment) is not explicitly mandated in these policies; escorts may be provided in specific security contexts (e.g., interceptions per FAA guidelines) but are not a standard requirement for cleared flights.

**Verification Notes:** The claim that Joyce Chernick is married to Aubrey Chernick and that they fund pro-Israel causes through the David Horowitz Freedom Center is supported by reliable sources, including articles detailing their philanthropic activities and connections to conservative, pro-Israel organizations. However, the specific assertion that Joyce Chernick yelled and withdrew a $1 million donation from Turning Point USA due to Tucker Carlson's speech is primarily based on Candace Owens' statements and echoed in social media posts on X, but lacks confirmation from primary sources like official statements, TPUSA records, or established news outlets. Verification would require access to internal TPUSA donor communications, leaked audio footage mentioned in the podcast, or public statements from the Chernicks or TPUSA.

**Verification Notes:** Initial reports from October 2025 indicate Bill Ackman donated $1 million to Defend NYC, a super PAC opposing Mamdani. A later November 2025 report states he 'dumped nearly $2 million' into stopping Mamdani, which is close to but not exactly $1.75 million. The claim's specific amount is not precisely matched across sources, making it mixed with the higher figure supported but not exact.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable news sources, including the New York Daily News and Yahoo News, confirm Joe Gebbia donated $2 million to super PACs supporting Andrew Cuomo in opposition to Zohran Mamdani in the 2025 NYC mayoral race. Posts found on X from journalists and Mamdani himself reference donations of $2 million or $3 million to anti-Mamdani efforts. No sources confirm the exact figure of $3.1 million, making the specific amount inaccurate, but the claim of a significant donation to stop Mamdani is supported by evidence.

**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, ABC News, Reuters, AP News, and local outlets like Lehi Free Press, confirm Charlie Kirk was rushed to and pronounced dead at Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem, Utah, following the shooting at Utah Valley University. This supports the claim that he was taken to Timpanogos, described as a smaller regional hospital. However, the claim that it was 'a little farther away' and a 'trauma III center' is mixed: posts on X and some reports suggest Utah Valley Hospital (a Level II trauma center) was closer and better equipped for severe trauma, indicating Timpanogos may indeed be farther and less equipped (potentially Level III), but official news sources do not explicitly confirm or refute the distance or exact trauma level comparison, mixing verifiable facts with interpretive elements.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources, including the Daily Mail article and posts on X, confirm that Kash Patel fired the chief of the Utah FBI bureau (Mehtab Syed, a woman) in August 2025, a month before the Charlie Kirk assassination in September. Multiple news outlets and X posts support the firing and gutting of Utah FBI leadership. However, no sources mention the replacement being specifically Robert Bowles, making that part of the claim unverifiable without official FBI personnel records or announcements (e.g., via FOIA request or FBI press releases).

Additionally, an official page for a 2022 summit (tpusafaith.com/summit22/) indicates the 2023 event was not the first-ever, contradicting that part of the claim. The Nashville location is accurate.

These reports were published in early June 2025, not June 2024 as claimed, making the date inaccurate while the substance of the accusations is supported.

**Verification Notes:** The Utah Bureau of EMS lists Level I trauma centers in Utah as Intermountain Medical Center and University of Utah Hospital (not Utah Valley Hospital). Additional sources confirm Utah Valley Hospital is a Level II trauma center, contradicting the claim that it is Level I. Timpanogos Regional Hospital is confirmed as Level III via its official website. Thus, the trauma level for Timpanogos is accurate, but for UV Hospital is not. 'Less equipped' aligns with Level II being higher than Level III. 'Further' is context-dependent and unverifiable without the incident's exact location, though some social media discussions suggest varying distances based on site (e.g., closer from UVU).

**Verification Notes:** Wikipedia confirms that Lance Wallnau attended Valley Forge Military Academy and College (supporting the graduation from a military academy) and that his father, Carl Wallnau, was an Air Force major. However, no reliable sources, including Wikipedia or other web results, mention Carl Wallnau serving under General Patton. This part of the claim appears unverifiable based on available information; verification would require access to military service records (e.g., via FOIA request to the National Archives or Department of Defense personnel files) to confirm any WWII-era service details under Patton's command.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Newsweek and Times Now, confirm that Candace Owens released a clear image purporting to show Tyler Robinson at a Dairy Queen in Orem at 6:38 p.m. after the shooting, matching the podcast claim. However, the image is unverified by law enforcement, and official sources have not confirmed its authenticity, timestamp, or that it depicts Robinson at that exact time. Fact-checks address related theories but do not debunk the image's existence, only specific interpretations. Verification would require official confirmation from Utah police, Dairy Queen surveillance records, or court documents via FOIA.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including Reuters, AP News, Fox News, and Al Jazeera, confirm that the FBI announced cutting ties with the ADL on or around October 1, 2025, due to criticisms of the ADL's extremism glossary including Charlie Kirk's organization. However, this announcement did not occur 'yesterday' relative to the current date of December 7, 2025; the timing element is inaccurate, while the core fact of the announcement is supported.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Source:** [Anti-Defamation League - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Britannica, ADL's official history page, and Wikipedia, confirm that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was founded in 1913 by the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish service organization, initially as the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. This supports the claim that the ADL was 'born out of' B'nai B'rith, which is Jewish. However, while B'nai B'rith was founded in 1843 with a fraternal structure inspired by Freemasonry and some founders were Freemasons, it is not officially a Freemason organization but rather an independent Jewish fraternal group. The 'Freemason' label is an interpretive exaggeration not directly supported by primary sources like official histories or encyclopedias, which describe it as a Jewish service or fraternal organization.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Source:** [Leo Frank - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Frank)
**Verification Notes:** The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was founded in October 1913 by B'nai B'rith, and its announcement by Adolf Kraus explicitly mentioned the Leo Frank case as an example of anti-Semitism, supporting the claim that the organization was formed in response to his trial. However, the ADL's broader mission was to combat defamation against Jews, not solely to defend Frank personally. Regarding Frank being a 'pedophile and a murderer,' he was convicted of murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan in 1913, with allegations of sexual assault, but the conviction was for murder only (no rape charge was upheld), and his guilt remains highly disputed—many sources, including a 1986 posthumous pardon by Georgia, suggest innocence due to anti-Semitic bias in the trial and evidence pointing to another suspect (Jim Conley). Multiple reliable sources (e.g., Britannica, New Georgia Encyclopedia) confirm the ADL's founding link to the case but note debates over Frank's guilt, making the claim a mix of accurate historical context and contested interpretation.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Mixed (high)
**Source:** [Leo Frank - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Frank)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, New Georgia Encyclopedia, and History.com, confirm Leo Frank was a Jewish superintendent (not owner) of the National Pencil Company in Atlanta in 1913; Mary Phagan was a 13-year-old employee who was found strangled and sexually molested in the factory basement on April 26, 1913. The claim accurately states the year, location, Phagan's age, her employment, and that she was found raped/sexually assaulted. However, Frank was not the factory owner (he managed it) and descriptions of him as 'unbelievably wealthy' are exaggerated—he was a well-connected businessman but not extraordinarily so. Posts on X reflect ongoing debates but align with historical accounts of assault.

**Verification Notes:** The claim's phrase 'love letters' is a metaphorical expression used by FBI Director Kash Patel in his announcement, not literal letters, but it reflects documented praise from Comey, such as his 2014 speech to the ADL where he highlighted their partnership and training of 47,000 law enforcement officers. The 'embedded FBI agents' element is supported by reports of a formal FBI-ADL partnership under Comey involving intelligence sharing and agent training, as confirmed in multiple outlets including Fox News, Newsweek, and historical ADL-FBI collaborations; however, 'love letters' adds interpretive exaggeration.

**Verification Notes:** Official U.S. Air Force sources, including from Minot Air Force Base and U.S. Strategic Command, confirm that Operation Valhalla Strike was a real training exercise held at Camp Ripley, Minnesota, from August 24-29, 2025, involving personnel from the 891st Missile Security Forces Squadron at Minot AFB. This supports the claim's elements of location, Minot AFB involvement, and the name 'Operation Valhalla' (full name is 'Valhalla Strike'). However, the dates are inaccurate—the exercise ran until August 29, not August 27, and was about six days long, not 'a couple of days.' No reliable sources mention it as a 'joint exercise with civilians'; this appears to be an unsubstantiated interpretation, though some unverified social media posts on X speculate about civilian involvement. Multiple government and military news outlets corroborate the core facts but refute or omit the civilian and exact date claims.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources, including Hindustan Times, Times of India, and Black Westchester, report that Candace Owens' podcast reached #1 in the world based on Podscribe's metrics for downloads and views per episode in November 2025, supporting the claim in that specific context. However, conflicting information from X posts and other checks indicate it was #1 only briefly on Podscribe (which may not filter fake engagement), and overall rankings (e.g., on Spotify or general charts) show it lower, with Joe Rogan as #1, making the absolute 'number one in the world' claim inaccurate or overstated.

This supports the existence of the lawsuit as a verifiable fact. However, the characterization of it as 'ill-advised' is Owens' subjective interpretation and not a verifiable element.

The claim accurately describes the accusation and location but incorrectly names the pastor as 'Rob Coy' instead of 'Bob Coy'; no sources refer to a 'Rob Coy' in this context. Wikipedia and other outlets note no charges were filed, but the accusation led to his firing from a subsequent job.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including POLITICO and The New York Times, confirm that Michael Bloomberg donated a total of $8.3 million to a super PAC affiliated with Andrew Cuomo in the 2025 New York City mayoral race, with the explicit aim of supporting Cuomo and opposing Zohran Mamdani.

This aligns with the claim's details, though the exact name 'Shulman' appears to be a variant or error for 'Shillman.'

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including local news outlets and biographical profiles, confirm that Rob McCoy served as Mayor of Thousand Oaks from December 2018 through December 2019. The Borderline Bar and Grill shooting occurred on November 7, 2018, so his assumption of the mayoral role in December 2018 is approximately one month later. In Thousand Oaks, the mayor is selected annually by the city council from its members, which aligns with the claim's timeline and use of 'elected' in the context of council selection.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable news sources like Yahoo Finance and Fortune report that Turning Point USA had $85 million in revenue from a network of 500,000 donors following Charlie Kirk's death in September 2025, indicating a significant surge in donations post-death. Additional sources from The Guardian and Newsweek confirm increased fundraising and donations after the event, with one mentioning a $1 million pledge. Posts on X also reference figures around $80-90 million in the weeks following his death, supporting the claim's approximation of $90 million in that timeframe. Prior revenue was lower (e.g., $39.2 million in 2020), suggesting the jump includes post-death contributions. The claim is supported as an approximate figure, though exact timing and breakdown are not fully detailed in primary sources.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news sources, including Fox News, CBN News, and Church Leaders, confirm Frank Turek was a few feet away from Charlie Kirk during the assassination at Utah Valley University, was wearing a white hat, ducked down after the shot, helped load Kirk into an SUV, and accompanied him to the hospital while performing CPR. Posts on X further corroborate these details from eyewitness accounts and videos.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news articles, including this one from Hindustan Times, report that Josh Hammer released full text messages from a group chat involving Charlie Kirk to refute Candace Owens' claims, confirming a Zoom call or long talk the night before Kirk's death. However, no reliable sources quote or confirm any specific text from Kirk saying 'they are gonna kill me' on the same day as the Zoom call. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., the existence of a night call and released texts about frustration with donors) with an unsubstantiated allegation about the 'kill me' text and its timing. To verify, access to the complete original text message screenshots, timestamps, or an official investigation report (e.g., via law enforcement or court documents) would be required, as news reports do not provide this detail.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** Searches for New York Post articles matching the claim returned no results confirming an exclusive photo of the gun published at 9:21 a.m. Mountain Time (11:21 a.m. Eastern) on September 11, 2025. Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, NY Times, ABC News, and NBC News, describe official releases of photos, video, and rifle details by the FBI and law enforcement on September 11, but none attribute an exclusive gun photo to the New York Post. An FBI press conference occurred on September 11 (aligning with the 'two hours after' timeline if at ~7 a.m. MT), but the specific NY Post publication could not be located. Verification would require access to New York Post's publication archives or internal records from September 11, 2025, to confirm or refute the existence and timing of such an article.

**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_James_Robinson)
**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources, including Wikipedia (sourced from news reports) and articles from BBC, NBC, CNN, and NPR, confirm Tyler Robinson was taken into custody on the evening of September 11, 2025, after surrendering at the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Utah, facilitated by his family and a retired detective. However, no primary sources (e.g., official police statements, arrest records, or news articles) specify the exact time as around 7 p.m., mention local texts circulating at that time, or indicate he was 'picked up' in Warner Valley (sources describe a voluntary surrender, not a pickup). Posts on X suggest times like 10 p.m. or 11 p.m., but these are inconclusive and not reliable evidence. Verification would require access to official arrest logs, police reports from Washington County Sheriff's Office, or FOIA-requested documents detailing the exact timeline and location; news archives do not provide this level of specificity for the custody event.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources such as news articles, official statements, or government documents were found confirming that President Trump made an announcement at exactly 6 a.m. on September 12 about a suspect being in custody with a high degree of certainty. Posts on X from that date quote similar statements attributed to Trump on Fox & Friends, but X posts are inconclusive and cannot serve as factual evidence on their own. The claim mixes a specific time (6 a.m.) with a verifiable public appearance format (Fox & Friends, which airs starting at 6 a.m. ET), but without transcripts, video footage, or reports from established outlets like Fox News, CNN, or the White House, it remains unverifiable. Verification would require access to official Fox News archives, White House press releases, or contemporaneous news reports from September 12, 2025.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as an official statement from the American Jewish Committee (AJC) or reports from established news outlets, were found confirming that the AJC called Charlie Kirk an anti-Semite and 'dangerous.' Searches yielded discussions of conspiracy theories surrounding Kirk's death and corrections to unrelated antisemitism claims about him, but nothing directly supporting this specific claim. X posts repeat similar assertions, but they are inconclusive and not reliable evidence. Verification would require an official AJC press release, archived statement on their website, or direct quotes in reputable news articles (e.g., via FOIA or AJC archives if not publicly available).

**Verification Notes:** The article reports Candace Owens' claim of an Egyptian Air Force plane (SU-BTT) flying out of Utah on Sept 10 after Charlie Kirk's assassination, implying a prior landing, but provides no independent confirmation of a Sept 4 landing or it being a 'full flight.' Other sources treat this as a conspiracy theory, with some noting debunking due to time zone confusion (e.g., UTC vs. local time). No primary evidence like flight logs or official records found; verification would require FAA flight data, Flightradar24 records for SU-BTT on Sept 4, 2025, or official US/Egyptian government statements.

**Verification Notes:** The claim lists five specific vehicles with license plates allegedly secured by Duncan Aviation in connection to a conspiracy theory about Charlie Kirk's assassination. While news sources and social media posts report Candace Owens making similar claims about rental cars and license plates (initially four, with a possible fifth added later), no reliable primary sources, such as official rental records, law enforcement reports, or company statements from Duncan Aviation, confirm these details. Verification would require access to private rental agreements, Duncan Aviation's internal records, or FOIA-requested documents from relevant authorities investigating the assassination. Established outlets discuss her theories but do not provide evidence supporting the specific vehicle and plate details as factual.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including major news outlets like CNN, were found confirming the existence of the claimed article or the student's account of seeing a man on the Lozier/Losee Center roof a week before the September 10, 2025, shooting. Available web results and X posts describe sightings on the day of the event but not prior weeks. The Wikipedia entry and FBI updates detail the assassination but omit any pre-event roof sightings. To verify, access to CNN archives from September 11, 2025, or direct statements from the alleged student/FBI tip line records via FOIA would be needed. Multiple search strategies yielded no supporting evidence, suggesting the claim may be unsubstantiated interpretation.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources (e.g., news articles from established outlets like Daily Mail, People, or Yahoo News, or official flight records) confirm or refute the existence of a specific plane departing Scottsdale at 8 a.m. local time and landing in Provo at 10 a.m. local time on September 10, 2025, owned by T.W. Lewis. Available web results focus on a different plane departing Provo after the shooting, with ownership unmasked in some reports, but not matching the claimed route or timing. X posts mention a morning flight linked to a TPUSA donor but are inconclusive and not reliable evidence. Verification would require public or FOIA-accessible flight records from FAA, FlightAware, or similar aviation databases to check registrations under T.W. Lewis or associated entities for that date and route.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as a direct X post from Blake Neff or news articles, were found confirming that he posted a screenshot of a call log with his mom at 11:24 Arizona time lasting 45 seconds. Searches on X and the web yielded discussions about related timelines, phone calls, and disputes involving Blake Neff, Candace Owens, and Charlie Kirk's death, but no evidence of the specific screenshot. To verify, access to Blake Neff's full X timeline, archived posts, or official statements confirming the post would be required.

**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official statements from Turning Point USA, published text messages, or reports from established news outlets (e.g., Reuters, BBC, or The Guardian), were found confirming or refuting the existence of written communications from Charlie Kirk expressing fear for his life the day before his death on September 10, 2025, or the off-record conversations with three individuals. Social media posts discuss Candace Owens' revelations and alleged screenshots, but these are inconclusive and cannot serve as evidence. The podcast episode title suggests TPUSA confirmed related text messages, but without external verification, the claim remains unsubstantiated. To verify, would require: public confirmation from the three unnamed sources, release and authentication of the written communications (e.g., via forensic analysis or court documents), or an official TPUSA statement; alternatively, investigative reporting from reliable news sources or FOIA requests for any related law enforcement records on threats to Kirk.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official autopsy reports, medical examiner statements, or ballistics analyses from government or law enforcement agencies, were found to confirm or refute the specifics of the wound (entry vs. exit) or the exact moment of death relative to hitting the ground. Available news articles from outlets like The New York Times provide timelines and maps of the shooting but lack forensic details. Posts on X discuss conflicting claims about entry/exit wounds but are not conclusive evidence. Verification would require access to the official autopsy report from the Utah medical examiner's office, ballistics reports from the FBI or local law enforcement, or declassified investigative documents via FOIA request.

**Verification Notes:** The claim is a personal anecdote from Rob O'Neill based on his combat experiences, stating that shirts did not move in a particular way when he shot people. No primary sources, such as news articles, official forensic analyses, or expert statements, were found that directly support or refute this subjective observation. Multiple search strategies (e.g., queries on ballistics, gunshot wound analysis, shirt movement in shootings, and Rob O'Neill's comments on the Brian Thompson assassination) yielded no reliable evidence addressing this specific detail. To verify, access to classified military records, videos from O'Neill's operations, or independent ballistic experiments replicating similar conditions (e.g., clothing response to specific calibers and velocities) would be required, potentially via FOIA requests to the Department of Defense or expert forensic reconstructions.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, The Guardian, ABC News, BBC, and FBI releases, detail the shooting event, footage availability, security aspects, and timeline, but none directly address whether immediate first aid was administered by the security team, such as applying gauze or pressure to the wound. The widow's thanks to first responders in BBC reporting implies some response occurred, but this likely refers to emergency services rather than immediate security actions. To verify, access to the full multi-angle footage (as referenced in sources like The Guardian and ABC News visual timeline) or official incident reports from UVU security, first responders, or autopsy details would be required; these could be obtained via FOIA requests to the FBI or local authorities.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official FBI statements, Utah government documents, or established news outlets (e.g., ABC News, The New York Times, BBC), confirm or refute the specific claim of FBI exerting pressure on Utah authorities to declare the Charlie Kirk assassination case closed as a lone gunman incident. Web searches and X posts reveal official narratives describing the suspect Tyler James Robinson as acting alone, with FBI collaboration in the investigation, but only unsubstantiated conspiracy theories on X suggest cover-ups or undue influence. Verification would require internal communications, such as leaked emails, FOIA-requested FBI or Utah state documents, or whistleblower testimony from involved authorities to confirm any pressure.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official FBI statements, Utah government documents, or established news outlets (e.g., CNN, PBS, NPR), confirm or mention any FBI pressure on Utah authorities to rule the assassination as a lone gunman act or to close the case. Official reports and news articles describe the incident as perpetrated by a single suspect, Tyler James Robinson, who was charged with aggravated murder, with authorities expressing confidence he acted alone (e.g., statements from Utah Gov. Spencer Cox). The claim originates from an anonymous 'authoritative source' in the podcast, which mixes verifiable facts (e.g., the suspect's name and charges) with unverified interpretation of motives. To verify, access to internal FBI or Utah law enforcement communications, such as emails or memos via FOIA requests, or public statements from involved officials would be needed. Posts on X reflect public sentiment and conspiracy speculation but do not provide conclusive evidence.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including Wikipedia, CNN, ABC News, or other major outlets, confirm or deny the existence of video footage showing Tyler Robinson firing the weapon or taking aim at Charlie Kirk. Reports detail CCTV footage of Robinson before and after the incident, but not the act itself. The case is ongoing with a trial scheduled for 2026, and detailed evidence (such as potential surveillance videos) has not been publicly disclosed. Verification would require access to court documents, prosecution evidence lists, official police reports, or FOIA requests to the FBI or Utah authorities for any non-public video evidence.

Available news articles discuss the suspect and ammunition but do not address bullet fragmentation or matching. Social media posts on X mention conflicting claims (e.g., some alleging a match, others questioning evidence), but these are not conclusive.

Web searches reveal discussions of post-shooting flights (e.g., private jet N888KG) and conspiracy theories on X about an Egyptian plane, but no verifiable details match the exact timing and route.

However, none specify the exact time as 12:23 (presumably local Mountain Time). X posts mention details like the shooter arriving on campus at 11:52, but no precise shooting time is given.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources confirm the exact date of February 27th (likely 2023 based on context) for Sean Feucht's announcement as a Turning Point USA Faith contributor. Available sources discuss a partnership for the 'Kingdom to the Capitol' tour launching in March 2023, but do not specify an announcement on February 27th. To verify, an official TPUSA press release, social media post, or news article dated February 27, 2023, would be required; further searches with varied queries (e.g., exact date archives) yielded no such evidence.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple sources, including news articles and LinkedIn profiles, confirm Mikey McCoy held the position of Chief of Staff at Turning Point USA starting in 2024 and continuing into 2025. However, no reliable public sources specify the exact promotion date of January 3, 2024. The claim references an internal email, which cannot be independently verified without access to Turning Point USA's internal communications or official announcements. To confirm the precise date, access to internal emails, HR records, or a FOIA-equivalent request (if applicable) would be required, but as a private organization, such details are not publicly available.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including news articles or official records, provide evidence that a specific plane tail number was searched on Google from Israel on September 8th, two days before Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10th. The claim appears in Candace Owens' podcast as part of broader conspiracy theories involving planes and Israel, but it lacks supporting documentation. Verification would require access to Google's private search logs or data (e.g., via subpoena or internal records), which are not publicly available. Google Trends was suggested in the transcript, but it does not offer granular, country-specific data for obscure terms like tail numbers on exact dates. Multiple searches across web and X/Twitter yielded discussions of Owens' related claims (e.g., Egyptian planes, Israel links) but no confirmation or refutation of this specific Google search allegation.

**Verification Notes:** No primary or reliable sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., CNN, ABC News, The Guardian) or official statements, confirm that federal authorities seized footage from Timpanogos Hospital related to Charlie Kirk's shooting. The provided web search results detail the shooting event on September 10, 2025, but do not mention any hospital involvement or footage seizure. The claim appears to circulate primarily on X (formerly Twitter) and in the podcast, often tied to conspiracy theories, but lacks corroboration. To verify, access to official FBI investigative reports, hospital records, or a FOIA request for federal seizure documents would be required. Reliable sources also do not confirm Kirk was taken to Timpanogos Hospital; they report he was fatally shot at the event site.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as direct screenshots, archived posts, or news articles, were found confirming a Facebook post by Lance Wallnau on November 6, 2020, with the exact quoted text. Searches for related web results and X posts show Wallnau's involvement in promoting election fraud claims and 'Stop the Steal' narratives in November 2020 (e.g., X posts from November 16, 26, and 30 discussing fraud in swing states), but none reference a specific Facebook post on that date with the claimed phrasing. To verify, access to Facebook archives, Wayback Machine captures of the post, or contemporaneous news reports quoting it exactly would be required.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, established news outlets, or official documents were found confirming that exactly fifteen pastors and leaders surrounded Donald Trump at the White House before the January 6 Stop the Steal rally to discuss spiritual warfare. Posts found on X mention 15 NAR apostles and prophets meeting with high-level Trump administration officials on December 29, 2020, but this information is inconclusive for a controversial topic, does not specify the location as the White House, and does not confirm direct interaction with Trump himself. The cited Wikipedia page provides general context on January 6 events but lacks details on this specific claim. To verify, access to White House visitor logs from late December 2020, FOIA-requested documents from the Trump administration, or firsthand accounts from participants (e.g., via investigative reports or books by experts like Matthew D. Taylor) would be needed.

**Verification Notes:** Searches across web sources and X posts reveal evidence of partnerships and collaborations between Lance Wallnau and Turning Point USA (TPUSA), including joint tours like the Courage Tour and efforts to mobilize voters in swing states, but no reliable primary sources (e.g., news articles, financial disclosures, or official statements) confirm or refute Wallnau providing significant funding to TPUSA Faith operations. Claims of behind-the-scenes funding appear based on anonymous internal sources, which are inherently unverifiable without public documentation. Verification would require access to TPUSA's detailed IRS Form 990 donor schedules, audited financial statements, or confirmed disclosures from Wallnau or TPUSA officials; no such records are publicly available in searched sources.

**Verification Notes:** The claim recounts a private conversation where an unnamed individual describes their position next to Charlie Kirk during the shooting and their immediate assessment of his condition. While news sources like The Guardian provide visual timelines, maps, and videos of the incident, they do not identify specific individuals seated to Kirk's left or confirm actions like securing footage. Social media posts discuss footage and suspicions about people near Kirk, but these are not reliable primary sources. Verification would require the individual's identity, access to unedited event footage for position confirmation, and possibly call records or statements from Candace Owens or the individual to substantiate the conversation.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official statements from TPUSA, the FBI, or investigative reports, confirm or refute that a specific individual secured and handed over footage to federal authorities following Charlie Kirk's shooting. News articles discuss Owens' claims about unreleased FBI-held video related to the incident, but do not verify the specific conversation or action described.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources, including Soap Central and Times of India, report Candace Owens' claim that she viewed private footage from behind Charlie Kirk showing no blood or gore. However, the footage has not been publicly released, and no independent verification from official sources (e.g., forensic reports or law enforcement) confirms or refutes what it depicts. Verification would require public release of the footage, an official autopsy report detailing wound ballistics, or FOIA-requested documents from the FBI or local authorities investigating the September 10, 2025, shooting.

Available sources, including Wikipedia, reference her involvement with TPUSA events in 2018 but provide no evidence for 2024. To verify, access to TPUSA's official 2024 event archives, speaker lists, video footage, or contemporaneous news reports from established outlets covering the specific conferences and tour dates would be required. The claim mixes verifiable past association with TPUSA (e.g., 2018 events) but the specific timing and details for 2024 remain unsupported.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources confirm or refute the existence of a specific text message from Charlie Kirk to Candace Owens dated May 22, 2025, with the described content about free speech censorship. While Turning Point USA has confirmed the authenticity of other leaked messages from Kirk regarding Israel-related pressures (from two days before his death), this particular May 22 exchange is not mentioned in any news articles, official statements, or verified documents. Verification would require access to original message screenshots, the full podcast episode for visual confirmation, or direct statements from Turning Point USA or other involved parties addressing this specific date and content.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official FBI statements or documents, confirm the existence of footage showing a woman with the shooter (Tyler Robinson) or any suppression by the FBI. Established news outlets like BBC, CBS, CNN, and The Guardian report on the shooting investigation, suspect details, evidence (e.g., DNA, confessions), and motives but do not mention any such footage or woman. The claim originates from Candace Owens' podcast and social media posts on X, with one news article (The Economic Times) reporting her allegation without independent verification. To verify, access to the alleged door cam footage, FBI investigative records (via FOIA request), or confirmation from multiple reliable outlets that have reviewed the evidence would be needed. The lack of corroboration in official or major news sources for this high-profile case suggests it remains an unsubstantiated claim.

**Verification Notes:** The memorial service for Charlie Kirk is well-documented as occurring at State Farm Stadium on September 21, 2025, with over 90,000 attendees and speeches from President Trump, Vice President Vance, and others. However, no reliable sources (including news articles from Fox News, CBS, PBS, NBC, USA Today, CNN, and Wikipedia) confirm or refute White House involvement in securing the venue, a personal phone call to the event coordinator, or the rescheduling of a scheduled RV show. X posts discuss rumors of a pre-booking in May but do not provide evidence for the claim's details. To verify, access to State Farm Stadium rental agreements, official White House or Turning Point USA statements on the booking process, or confirmation from RV show organizers about rescheduling would be required. No such primary evidence was found despite searching with variations on queries related to venue booking, White House involvement, and RV show rescheduling.

**Verification Notes:** The claim originates from the podcast's own analysis of slowed-down video footage, stating exactly 834 milliseconds between the shot sound and Mikey McCoy raising his phone. No independent reliable sources (e.g., news articles from established outlets like Daily Mail or Wikipedia entries) confirm or refute this precise measurement. Posts on X repeat similar timings (e.g., 0.8 seconds) but vary (some claim before the shot) and are not conclusive evidence. To verify, access to the original high-resolution video footage of the September 10, 2025, event and precise audio-visual timing tools would be required for independent measurement.

**Verification Notes:** The claim refers to alleged private messages from Charlie Kirk to Candace Owens on April 6, 2018, expressing a premonition of his death. No primary sources, such as the actual messages, news articles, or official statements from Turning Point USA, were found to confirm or refute this. Searches on the web and X (formerly Twitter) for references to these messages, premonitions, or dreams yielded no supporting evidence. Verification would require access to Kirk's private communications (e.g., via subpoena or release by TPUSA officials like Mikey McCoy) or independent corroboration from involved parties. The cited Wikipedia page on Kirk's 2025 assassination provides context on his life and death but does not mention any 2018 premonitions.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news outlets, including Hindustan Times, report that Candace Owens shared text messages from Charlie Kirk containing similar language about predicting his death and not living to see the end of the revolution, which aligns with parts of the transcript. However, the specific claim quote is from alleged private messages, and no primary evidence (e.g., screenshots, official statements from Turning Point USA, or independent verification) confirms authenticity. Verification would require access to Charlie Kirk's message archives, confirmation from Mikey McCoy (mentioned in the transcript), or a statement from Turning Point USA validating the texts. Ongoing disputes between Owens and TPUSA add uncertainty, but no direct refutation or confirmation of this exact phrase was found.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets or official statements from Turning Point USA, confirm the existence of text messages from Charlie Kirk sent the day before his death (September 9, 2025) explicitly stating that 'they' were going to kill him tomorrow, sent to TPUSA staff and security guards. Available reports discuss other leaked texts (e.g., about Israel positions 48 hours prior or prophecies from years earlier), but none match this specific claim. Posts on X echo Candace Owens' assertions but are inconclusive and not factual evidence.

**Verification Notes:** Reliable sources, including FBI updates and news reports from CNN, PBS, and AP, confirm Charlie Kirk's assassination occurred around 12:00 p.m. MT on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Provo, Utah. However, no primary sources (e.g., news articles, official statements, or flight records) mention or confirm a plane 'dip' approximately 26 minutes later. Discussions on X/Twitter reference similar suspicious flight activity (e.g., low-altitude passes around 24-30 minutes post-shooting), but these are not conclusive evidence.

The claim originates from Candace Owens herself, but independent verification is lacking. To verify, access to FAA aircraft registration records, FlightRadar24 data linked to ownership, or a FOIA request for detailed flight logs would be required. Searches on the web and X yielded discussions of related planes (e.g., Egyptian jets or other private jets in Provo) but no direct evidence on Lasai LLC ownership.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources, including Latin Times, People, US Weekly, and Daily Mail, confirm that a private jet (tail number N888KG) owned by Derek Maxfield departed from Provo Airport shortly after the Charlie Kirk shooting on September 10, 2025, and later disappeared from tracking. However, none provide the exact departure time of 1:20 p.m. local time. Posts on X suggest times around 1:11-1:12 p.m. MDT (based on UTC conversions from flight tracking data), but these are inconclusive as X posts may contain unverified claims, especially for controversial topics. To verify the precise time, official flight logs from the FAA, Flightradar24, or airport records would be required, potentially via a FOIA request.

Web searches and X posts discuss conspiracy theories around the flight but provide no evidence of such instructions; they focus on the jet's departure and transponder issues. The claim appears based on hearsay from the podcast. Verification would require internal airport or federal documents, such as FAA records, flight manifests, or FOIA requests for communications directing personnel to withhold or falsify information.

Ex-TPUSA member gives bombshell update on ‘Egyptian Air Force’ theory | Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/who-does-candace-owens-think-killed-charlie-kirk-ex-tpusa-member-gives-bombshell-update-on-egyptian-air-force-theory-101760299828271.html)
**Verification Notes:** Available news articles and X posts report on Candace Owens' claims about an Egyptian military plane (tail number SU-BTT) being in Provo, Utah, on September 10, 2025, with a prior trip to the US in July 2025. However, the specific assertion of 'only twice in the past year' prior to the September trip conflicts with initial reports (e.g., her own post claiming it was the 'first trip ever' in July) and later escalations in conspiracy theories mentioning multiple planes and up to 73 overlapping flights. No primary sources like official flight logs confirm the exact number of visits. Verification would require access to comprehensive flight records from sources such as FlightRadar24, FAA databases, or military aviation authorities, potentially obtainable via FOIA requests for international military flight details.

**Source:** [Candace Owens Screws Up Time Zones While Promoting Latest Charlie Kirk Conspiracy](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/candace-owens-screws-time-zones-122944083.html)
**Verification Notes:** The claim stems from conspiracy theories promoted by Candace Owens, with web sources and X posts echoing unverified allegations of Egyptian military subcontractors being dropped off in Provo on September 10. However, reliable news outlets report official investigations concluding the suspect acted alone, with debunkings focused on timing errors (e.g., time zone confusion). No primary sources, such as flight manifests or official passenger lists, confirm or refute the specific details about subcontractors. Verification would require access to FAA flight records, passenger manifests, or FOIA requests for aviation and investigative documents from U.S. authorities.

**Verification Notes:** The claim relies on an anonymous whistleblower cited by Candace Owens, with no publicly available primary evidence such as flight manifests, passenger lists, or official statements from the Egyptian government, FAA, or U.S. authorities confirming that military subcontractors were dropped off in Provo and did not return to Cairo. Web searches and X posts discuss the conspiracy theory but provide no verifiable documentation; articles report on Owens' allegations without independent confirmation and often highlight errors (e.g., time zone confusion). Verification would require access to confidential flight records, passenger manifests from the Egyptian Air Force, or FOIA requests to U.S. agencies like the FAA or DoD, which are not publicly available and may be classified due to the military nature of the flight.

**Source:** [N/A](N/A)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including news articles, official flight records, or government statements, were found mentioning a yellow plane with tail number SUBTT making a one-hour stopover in Minot, North Dakota, on September 4th (assuming 2025 based on context) before proceeding to Provo. Searches across web results and X posts yielded information on unrelated incidents, such as a July 2025 near-miss at Minot Airport and Egyptian jets in Provo on September 10th, but nothing matching the specific claim. Verification would require access to FAA flight logs, FlightAware or ADS-B tracking data, or official records from Minot International Airport/Minot AFB via FOIA request, which are not publicly available in the searched sources.

**Source:** [After Charlie Kirk’s Assassination, a Bumper Crop of Conspiracy Theories](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/us/charlie-kirk-assassination-conspiracy-theories.html)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple news sources, including The New York Times, Axios, and The Guardian, report on Candace Owens promoting conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination, including claims of screenshots from group chats, but none provide independent verification of the screenshot's authenticity. Posts on X discuss Owens sharing the screenshot, but X content is not conclusive evidence. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., the assassination date around September 10, 2025, based on timeline in sources) with unverified ones (the chat's existence and content). Verification would require statements from chat participants (e.g., Rob McCoy or others named), digital forensic analysis of the screenshot, or official investigation records from law enforcement, such as FBI documents obtained via FOIA.

**Source:** [Brian Harpole - Groundbreaking Evidence From Charlie Kirk’s Head of Security | SRS #254 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0fmq1zffGw)
**Verification Notes:** The interview between Brian Harpole and Shawn Ryan (likely intended as 'Sean Ryan' in the claim) exists and is documented in multiple sources, including news articles from Deseret News and KSL.com that report on Harpole's recounting of events without labeling them as lies. However, posts on X (formerly Twitter) contain user accusations of specific lies (e.g., about a 'trap door,' EMT presence, or drones), but these are inconclusive opinions and not supported by established news outlets or official investigations. No primary sources like fact-check articles, official statements, or documents confirm or refute deception. Verification would require access to the full interview transcript, cross-referenced with police reports, video footage, or eyewitness accounts from the event (e.g., via FOIA requests to Orem PD or Utah authorities) to check specific statements against evidence.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles, official statements, or documents, confirm or refute the occurrence of a specific phone call from Charlie Kirk to Candace Owens instructing her to stop speaking about Brigitte Macron. The claim originates from Owens' podcast and is echoed in social media posts on X, but these are not conclusive evidence. Multiple searches across web results and X posts discuss Owens' broader conspiracy theories involving Kirk, the Macrons, and assassination plots, but none provide verifiable details on this private call. Verification would require access to phone records (e.g., via subpoena or FOIA request to telecom providers), text message logs shared publicly with authentication, or corroborating statements from Kirk's estate, associates, or other witnesses.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news outlets and posts on X report Candace Owens making this allegation in her podcast, including direct quotes matching the claim. However, the claim refers to a private phone conversation between Owens and Andrew Kolvet (likely misspelled as Kolvet), with no publicly available recording, transcript, or confirmation/denial from Kolvet specifically addressing this quote. Andrew Kolvet has denied other related claims by Owens (e.g., about Israeli links) as 'laughably untrue' in sources like Hindustan Times, but not this exact statement. Verification would require a recording of the call, call logs, or a direct statement from Kolvet or witnesses confirming the quote.

**Verification Notes:** The claim refers to a private phone conversation on September 10th, when Charlie Kirk was in the hospital after being shot, where Andrew Kolvet allegedly warned Candace Owens about a 'list' including her and Tucker Carlson, advising them to lay low. News sources, including this article, report Owens publicly questioning Kolvet about issuing such a warning after Kirk's death, but they do not provide independent evidence confirming the conversation occurred or its content. X posts and other web results confirm the date of Kirk's hospitalization and shooting as September 10th, but offer no corroboration of the specific warning. Verification would require statements from Kolvet, call logs, or other direct evidence of the interaction, which are not publicly available.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (low)
**Source:** [FBI Wilmington Field Office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/wilmington)
**Verification Notes:** The part of the claim stating that 920 King Street houses the DEA, FBI, and Secret Service is supported by reliable government sources: the FBI Wilmington Resident Agency is located at 920 N. King Street, Wilmington, DE, and cross-references confirm DEA and Secret Service offices share the same address in official directories. However, no primary sources (e.g., news articles, official flight records, or government statements) were found confirming an Egyptian plane with tail number SUBTT (likely SU-BTT) landing in a federally monitored hangar in Wilmington, Delaware, or a foreign dignitary being discreetly moved from there to 920 King Street. Posts on X and podcast transcripts discuss these elements as part of conspiracy theories, but they are not conclusive evidence. Verification would require access to FAA flight logs, ADS-B tracking data from sites like FlightRadar24, or FOIA requests for federal agency records on diplomatic movements and hangar activities.

**Verification Notes:** Available news articles and X posts confirm Candace Owens parted ways with the Daily Wire in late March 2024, with the public announcement on March 22, 2024, but no reliable sources specify an exact firing date of March 19, 2024, or confirm the Brigitte Macron episode aired precisely on March 13, 2024. One X post incorrectly suggests the episode was in March 2023, but most sources align with a March 2024 timeline for both events without exact dates. Verification would require access to internal Daily Wire employment records, official podcast publication logs, or timestamped episode archives from the Candace Owens Show.

**Source:** [IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE EMMANUEL MACRON and](https://clarelocke.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Complaint89.pdf)
**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources confirm the specific claim of receiving a cease-and-desist letter on December 3, 2024, as the first ever from Brigitte Macron and her lawyers. Available web results and X posts reference a defamation lawsuit filed in July 2025 and mention prior requests for retractions or a cease-and-desist in the case file, but none specify the December 3, 2024 date or confirm it as the first. Recent articles report on Owens' broader claims but do not independently verify this detail. To verify, access to the full lawsuit documents detailing dates of any cease-and-desist letters, or a copy of the letter itself with timestamp, would be required.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable external sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., The Times of India, Daily Mail, USA Today) or official statements, confirm or refute the specific claim of Charlie Kirk contacting Candace Owens on February 24, 2025, to relay a White House request to stop discussing Brigitte Macron. The claim involves a private communication, and while Owens has made public allegations about related conspiracies involving Macron, Kirk's death, and assassination attempts (as noted in Wikipedia and other news sources), this particular interaction is not independently documented. Verification would require access to private text messages, phone records, or official White House communications (e.g., via FOIA request), or corroborating statements from involved parties, which are not available in public records.

**Verification Notes:** The claim involves a private phone call between Sergio Gor and Candace Owens on February 25th (likely 2025 based on context), which is inherently difficult to verify without direct evidence from the parties involved. Web searches and X posts reference Owens' broader allegations about Brigitte Macron and related threats, but provide no independent confirmation or refutation of this specific call. Posts on X repeat similar claims (with spelling variations like 'Sergio Gore'), but these are not reliable evidence. To verify, access to phone records, call logs, or statements from Gor or the White House would be required; no such primary sources were found in available results.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news outlets, including Times of India, The Independent, BBC, and Deadline, report that Candace Owens claimed Trump called her in February to ask her to stop discussing Brigitte Macron. These sources confirm the general claim of a February call but do not specify the exact date of February 26th or provide independent verification (e.g., no statements from Trump or White House logs). The claim relies solely on Owens' account, with no corroborating evidence found. To verify, access to White House phone records, Trump's personal call logs, or a deposition from the ongoing Macron defamation lawsuit against Owens would be required, as these could confirm or refute the private call.

**Verification Notes:** News articles from reliable outlets like The Salt Lake Tribune and Fox News report that Brian Harpole texted or raised concerns with UVU Police Chief Jeff Long about rooftop security, implying the communication was Harpole's. However, posts on X (formerly Twitter) claim the text exchange was actually between Dan Flood (a Turning Point USA security member) and Chief Long, aligning with the podcast claim. There are no primary sources, such as the actual text messages, screenshots with sender details, or official statements from Harpole, Flood, or Long, to confirm who sent the messages. Discrepancies between news reports and social media sentiment make it impossible to verify without access to the original texts or confirming documents, which could be obtained via FOIA requests to UVU or police records.

**Verification Notes:** The claim relies on anonymous emails from locals to Candace Owens alleging federal pressure not to share footage. News sources report on Owens' statements about missing or suppressed footage in the Charlie Kirk case, including FBI denials of requests for surveillance video, but no primary evidence (e.g., official statements, documents, or direct accounts from locals) independently confirms or refutes that federal agents specifically instructed locals not to share footage. Verification would require public statements from the locals, FBI internal communications obtained via FOIA, or investigative journalism corroborating the interactions.

**Source:** [Was Tyler Robinson At Dairy Queen After Charlie Kirk Shooting? What We Know - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/tyler-robinson-dairy-queen-charlie-kirk-2132434)
**Verification Notes:** Multiple established news outlets, including Newsweek, Times Now, and Yahoo, report on Candace Owens' podcast claim that the Dairy Queen is about a 17-minute drive from the campus where the Charlie Kirk shooting occurred on September 10, 2025. However, these sources primarily reiterate the claim without providing independent verification of the driving time, such as map calculations or official location details. Posts found on X also mention the 17-minute drive, reflecting public sentiment around the conspiracy theory, but X posts are inconclusive for factual verification, especially on controversial topics. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., existence of a photo and locations in Orem, Utah) with unconfirmed interpretation (exact driving time). To verify, access to precise addresses of the campus shooting site and the specific Dairy Queen, along with tools like Google Maps for real-time driving estimates, would be required; no such primary evidence was found in available sources.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources were found confirming the exact date or time of the neighbor interview clip referenced in the claim. TMZ published the footage of the person of interest on September 11, 2025, in the evening (22:38), which is the day after the assassination on September 10, 2025. If the interview clip was indeed from the morning of September 11, the claim that TMZ had already publicized the footage by then would be false, but without confirmation of the clip's timing, the claim cannot be verified. Verification would require access to the original news broadcast or article containing the Samuel Steele interview, including its publication or air date.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles, official documents, or government records, were found to confirm or refute the claim that virtually everyone on a specific block in Orem, Utah, works for Caldera Engineering or that the Steeles are a big family in Orem. The company's website and related business profiles confirm Caldera Engineering exists in nearby Provo, Utah, and manufactures valves, but provide no details on employee residences or family connections. X posts echo similar rumors but are not reliable evidence. Verification would require access to property records from Utah County assessor's office, Caldera Engineering's employee directories, or local census data via FOIA requests to confirm neighborhood employment patterns and family prominence.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable sources, including news articles from established outlets (e.g., BBC as mentioned in the transcript), official statements, or public records, were found mentioning a Sherry Steele as a resident of any building complex in Orem, Utah, in connection with the Charlie Kirk shooting. Multiple search strategies across web results and X posts yielded no evidence of her existence, footage, or involvement. Verification would require access to private resident databases, property records from Utah County, voter registration logs, or FOIA requests for police reports and witness statements related to the incident. The absence of any public documentation for a purported witness in a high-profile assassination suggests the claim cannot be confirmed or refuted without these restricted sources.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., CNN, Fox News, NYT) or official statements from law enforcement, confirm the gun was found in a backyard by a chicken coop. The claim appears to originate from local rumors and conspiracy theories discussed on podcasts and social media, with some posts on X mentioning 'woods' as the recovery location instead. Multiple searches across web results yield details on the shooting and suspect's path but no specifics on a chicken coop. Verification would require access to official police reports, evidence logs, or court documents from the Utah County prosecutor's office detailing the exact gun recovery site.

**Verification Notes:** No reliable primary sources, such as official police reports, news articles from established outlets, or property records, confirm or refute the claim of a mysteriously vacant university-owned home next to the gun's recovery site. Web searches and X posts mention the gun being found 'in the woods' or at a 'drop point' near Utah Valley University, with some unverified social media speculation about a chicken coop, but nothing addresses a adjacent university-owned vacant home. Verification would require access to official investigative documents (e.g., Washington County Sheriff's Office reports), property ownership records from local assessor's office or university disclosures, or FOIA requests for detailed crime scene maps.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources such as official property records, news articles from established outlets, or statements from the ADL or FBI were found to confirm or refute the claim of shared office space in Connecticut. The claim appears to originate from social media posts on X, which cite unspecified property records but do not provide them. Web searches yielded results about the FBI cutting ties with the ADL in 2025, but nothing on shared spaces. To verify, access to official Connecticut property records, ADL/FBI office directories, or a FOIA request for federal building occupancy details would be required.

However, no sources specify or mention the Connecticut field office being sent or involved. Posts on X discuss FBI agents at the scene but do not reference Connecticut. To verify this specific claim, access to internal FBI deployment records, official statements on field office assignments, or a FOIA request to the FBI for investigation team details would be required. The lack of mention in extensive coverage suggests this detail may not be publicly documented.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple reliable news outlets (e.g., France 24, Euronews, Daily Mail) report on Owens' public claim of being contacted by a high-ranking French government employee on or around November 20, 2025, but emphasize that no evidence has been provided to support the contact or the alleged information shared. French media and officials have dismissed the broader assassination plot as false or unsubstantiated. The claim of the contact itself is a personal assertion without independent verification, such as communication records or whistleblower confirmation. Verification would require access to private communications (e.g., emails, messages), a public statement from the alleged employee, or results from an official investigation (e.g., via French or U.S. intelligence agencies).

**Verification Notes:** Multiple news outlets, including Euronews, Jerusalem Post, and Times of India, report on Candace Owens' claims of a $1.5 million payment by Macron for assassins (one Israeli, one French-Canadian) routed through an elite club (variously reported as 'Club des Cent' or similar to 'club des Saints'), but all emphasize that no evidence or official confirmation has been provided. The claim remains unsubstantiated allegations amid a defamation lawsuit. Verification would require access to French government financial records, bank transfer documents, or investigative reports from authorities like the FBI (to which Owens reportedly submitted claims), potentially obtainable via FOIA requests or court proceedings.

**Type:** Factual
**Veracity:** Unverifiable (high)
**Source:** [Assassination of Charlie Kirk - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Charlie_Kirk)
**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official medical examiner reports, court documents, or statements from investigators, publicly confirm or refute whether Erika Kirk has seen the autopsy report or specific evidence portions in the Charlie Kirk assassination case. An autopsy is standard for homicides under Utah law, and evidence like DNA matches and shell casings has been reported in news outlets, but details of family access are not disclosed. The claim originates from Erika Kirk's own statement in a Jesse Watters interview, as noted in social media and news discussions. Verification would require FOIA requests for medical examiner records, court filings from the prosecution against Tyler Robinson, or official statements confirming what evidence was shared with the family.

**Verification Notes:** Multiple searches for counts of TPUSA campus tours headlined by Candace Owens versus others (e.g., queries on joint tours with Charlie Kirk, Campus Clash series, and speaker frequencies) yielded references to specific events like the 2018 Campus Clash tour and a 2019 UVU event co-hosted with Kirk, but no comprehensive lists or comparisons of total headline appearances. News articles and X posts confirm Owens' frequent involvement in TPUSA events from 2018 to 2024, but lack quantifiable data on who headlined the most. Verification would require internal TPUSA records, such as event logs or official speaker schedules, potentially obtainable via FOIA if publicly funded elements are involved, or direct statements from TPUSA.

**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as official TPUSA documents, news articles from established outlets, or university records, were found detailing the typical booking timeline for TPUSA campus events. The Wikipedia entry describes TPUSA's mission and operations but does not address event booking processes or timelines. Posts on X suggest events are usually scheduled far in advance, but these cannot be used as conclusive evidence due to potential unreliability. Verification would require access to TPUSA's internal booking records, official statements from TPUSA or university administrations, or FOIA requests for campus event approvals to confirm standard practices.

**Source:** [The rise of Newbury Park Pastor Rob McCoy](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2022/10/05/godspeak-newbury-park-pastor-rob-mccoy/8182148001/)
**Verification Notes:** No primary sources, such as news articles, court documents, or official statements, were found in the provided web results to confirm or refute the specific claim about Rob McCoy's long-term friendship with Thomas Camino post-conviction, or Camino's alleged involvement in the Calvary Chapel Church's Home Fellowship program granting access to children in 2022. The linked source is a 2022 news article profiling McCoy but does not mention Camino or the controversy. Posts on X discuss similar allegations stemming from the podcast, but they are not reliable evidence and reflect public sentiment rather than verified facts. To verify, would require access to 2022 news archives (e.g., local California outlets like VC Star or LA Times), court records of Camino's conviction, or official church statements/records from Calvary Chapel regarding the Home Fellowship program and any related controversies.
