> Turning Point has moved to formally respond to all the things that we have said. And after a very long diatribe in which they wildly misrepresent the public and global investigation of Charlie Kirk's assassination, they at long last issued a public invitation or a challenge.

**Type:** Factual

### [ep-his-JBjlkh8 @ 00:02:31](/episodes/ep-his-JBjlkh8.md#^t-00-02-14)

**Type:** Factual

### [ep-his-JBjlkh8 @ 00:08:35](/episodes/ep-his-JBjlkh8.md#^t-00-08-26)
