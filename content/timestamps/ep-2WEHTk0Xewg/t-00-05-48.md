## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Then we find out that Lance, I guess, decided to take a picture and then text Tyler back. And here is where he asks him. Lance says, "Tyler, what? You're joking, right?" Because the note said, "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I'm going to take it." So Lance is like, "What? You're joking." And Robinson says to him—Tyler says—"I'm still okay, my love, but I am stuck in Orem, that's the town that UVU is at, for a little while longer yet." So poetic. "A little while longer yet." I'm going to look that up on my phone later. "It shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest, I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age.
