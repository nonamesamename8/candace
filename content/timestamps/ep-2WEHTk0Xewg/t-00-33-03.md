## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> We're not gonna even tell you about the fact that we just raided this place a couple of hours ago. And the person whose place we raided, who was the one that the family says is super internet, we just kind of released, we weren't interested in that. What are we to discern from all of this? I'll tell you, I'll tell you my take on this. I think the person in the maroon that's walking is different from the person that's walking up the stairs. It's a gut thing, okay? I don't know, no, but I know, okay? I don't know, no, but I know. It makes sense in the timeline of George Zinn, the decoy boy, that we've got other people that are doing different things. And they do not want us to prod the narrative about the person in maroon. It doesn't make sense, they can't tell us. He said he planned this for weeks.
