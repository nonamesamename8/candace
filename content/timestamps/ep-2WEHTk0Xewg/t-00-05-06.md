## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> the roommate—that's Lance—received a text message from Robinson which said, "Drop what you are doing. Look under my keyboard." And so Lance—I don't know what he does all day, but he can do that. He knows he's home. And Lance then runs. I'm saying he ran, prances—who knows—and looks, and he sees this note. And to be clear, we're never going to be able to see that note because the feds have since told us that the note was destroyed. But even though he destroyed the note, he took a picture of it. Yeah, that makes sense because if you're gonna destroy something, the best thing to do is to take a picture of it. And the feds saw the picture, but we're not gonna be able to see either. Anyways, don't think about it if you want it to make sense.
