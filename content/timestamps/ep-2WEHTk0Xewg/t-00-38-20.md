## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Also want to remind you guys of Beekeeper's Naturals because as a mom of four young kids, life is constantly on the move. There's school drop-offs, there's work, there's travel, there's play dates. And let's be honest: germs are everywhere. That's why I'm so thankful for Beekeeper's Naturals and their amazing propolis throat spray. If you haven't heard of propolis, it's this natural immune-supporting substance that bees make to protect their hives. It's like nature's own shield, packed with antioxidants and over 300 beneficial compounds. It's been used for centuries to help support immunity, to soothe scratchy throats, and to keep you feeling your best. I use Propolis Throat Spray especially during travel or school season. It's clean, natural. It is free from all the junk that you cannot pronounce. There's no dyes, no chemicals, and no fake sugars. Beekeeper's Naturals recently launched a kid-friendly version of their nasal spray.
