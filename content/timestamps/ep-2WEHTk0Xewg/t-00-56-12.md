## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You're not going to emotionally use some jujitsu—and I'm referring here to Roy or Rob McCoy who says, "I'm Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s pastor, and here's the truth" or whatever it is—to look the other way right now, okay? You're not going to tell me that I have to feel too bad to investigate who shot my friend in front of my face. So stop the nonsense. This is what Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s pastor passed around to all of the people that were intimidating Charlie (Charlie Kirk) leading up to his death. It's funny that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s pastor couldn't find his voice when Benjamin Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu) was lying about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You're a pastor.
