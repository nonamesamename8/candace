## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Financial threats, I'm referring to—obviously. Some people are lying and saying that I said this donor tried to kill him or—it was so ridiculous. Financial threats—that's a threat, okay? That is a threat. Michelle E. writes: "You and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) are both so inspiring and have taught me a lot. I think it's amazing what you are continuing to do for Charlie (Charlie Kirk). God bless you, and God bless Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." Love and prayers from Scotland. Also, thank you guys. I see you defending me when people are lying and saying that I said stuff that I didn't say. You know, their new thing that went around is today I woke up, and like all of like Bill Ackman's cronies were like, "Would you like to comment?" The New York Post would like to—I said literally: "New York Post, you guys are just feds." And I'm not—I don't really feel like commenting. I don't care. The people are awake. We are awake, okay? We see what is happening, and you're not gonna distract me. Write your stupid articles. Call me whatever you need to call me.
