## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Why keep paying 20% or more to the banks when you could instead call my friends at American Financing? They have mortgage rates that are in the fives right now, and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their pocket and out of the hands of credit card companies. Right now, American Financing is helping homeowners save an average of $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high-interest debt with no upfront fees, no obligation, and just a 10-minute phone call to a salary-based mortgage consultant. And here's the kicker. If you start today, you could delay two mortgage payments—putting even more cash in your hands right away. So don't wait. Call American Financing now. The number's 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or visit americanfinancing.net/Owens—americanfinancing.net/Owens.
