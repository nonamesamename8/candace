## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. Let's actually start today's episode with a game. I mean, the feds like to play games. Let's play a game. And this is one that everybody can join in on, okay? It doesn't matter how old or young you are. I want you to grab your cell phone, and I want you to go to your text messages. And search for certain terms that you just use when you speak to your friends—terms that were just casually tossed into a conversation, the alleged conversation held between the 22-year-old alleged killer of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), Tyler Robinson, and his 22-year-old boyfriend, Lance Twiggs. The first term I want you to search is "retrieve." Look it up.
