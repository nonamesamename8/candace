## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I want you guys to know that once I look at all the footage from every angle—if I'm putting in this formal request and they said they would speak to the lawyers—I think the world would trust me to say there was no funny business and this is exactly what happened. So I've put in that request, and I want you guys to know that. And I mean business. I'm getting to the bottom of this. And lastly, I want to say to this—like "new flex Operation Mocking Pastor"—regarding which, by the way, the first time they went after Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and Candace (Candace Owens), a source told me—and I would love to get this confirmed— I'm going to find this out—that $150 million was spent on that. And it came from Benjamin Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu). I would like to figure out if that's true. But anyways, I'm obviously investigating this, and I'm not gonna let it go, okay?
