**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I want you guys to know that once I look at all the footage from every angle, if I'm putting in this formal request and they said they would speak to the lawyers, I think the world would trust me to say there was no funny business and this is exactly what happened. So I've put in that request and I want you guys to know that. And I mean business. I'm getting to the bottom of this. And lastly, I want to say to this, like, new flex Operation Mocking Pastor regarding which, by the way, the first time they went after Tucker Carlson and Candice Owens, a source told me, and I would love to get this confirmed, I'm going to find this out, that $150 million was spent on that. And it came from Benjamin Netanyahu. I would like to figure out if that's true. But anyways, I'm obviously investigating this and I'm not gonna let it go, okay?
