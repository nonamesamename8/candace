## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, I have a couple of notes here that I put here at the end of day one as we worked in this correspondence, which all had to happen. Let's call it 7 p.m. earliest, as I say here—which I want to be clear. The campus is four hours—three to four hours—away from where Tyler and Lance live together. We have a map here to show you that. So he's just loitering. Loitering until—like I said—earliest. He's signifying around, like, 7 p.m. that he's still very close to campus. That's a long day. That's a real long day just waiting to see when you can go in there. And there's a manhunt. And he's chill. He's chill because he's changed his outfit. How do we know he changed his outfit? Because he made it very clear
