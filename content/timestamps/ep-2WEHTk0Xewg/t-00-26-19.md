## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If we're putting this at around 11 p.m.-ish that they have brought him in and they are questioning him and they are now moving to raid his apartment in the wee hours of the morning—why would they very quickly release him? And beyond that, I'm going to let you know. Let's jump into Friday on the timeline. Like I said, early hours: Tyler and Lance have their apartment raided, and the device is seized. Uh, for whatever reason, the FBI quickly releases Lance. Um, and I'm told that he is dropped off at his parents' home—allegedly, allegedly. And then it's at 6 a.m. that President Trump (Donald Trump) announces with a high degree of certainty that they have the suspect. Okay. So are they still raiding his place? I don't know, but take a listen to Trump (Donald Trump) on Fox & Friends. (Clip of Donald Trump)
