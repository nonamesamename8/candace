## Transcript

**SPEAKER_6:**
> Seth Dillon was out there demanding that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) take me off the roster—pull me off stage—because I had said things that Benjamin Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu) didn't like or that he didn't like or whatever. Shocking that someone whose whole persona is wrapped up in the idea that we all get to speak—and if you don't like it, make a more compelling case— that that person and many others like him were advocating for me getting pulled off the stage because they don't like what I'm saying. This is a trend, and one that we should be really concerned about. It's not just about Israel, by the way—at all. The trend is really simple. People with power don't want to hear disagreement. They don't want to be challenged ever.
