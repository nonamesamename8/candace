## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> He wrote: "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was my friend, and I was his pastor. I want to simply say this regarding Candace (Candace Owens). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a friend to Candace (Candace Owens) and never publicly spoke poorly of her, though he disagreed with her. He never operated nor entertained gossip or innuendo concerning Candace (Candace Owens). My only comment I offer regarding Candace (Candace Owens) is this. I only wish at this tragic time of mourning she would be the friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) that he was to her. He would never have treated Candace (Candace Owens) or her family in such a way had—God forbid—this tragedy been hers. A friend loves at all times," and he drops a biblical proverb. Now, let me say this, okay? I hope that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have been the sort of friend that I'm being, okay? He would have never—why? Why wouldn't Charlie (Charlie Kirk) have investigated if I had been killed and we were being so obviously lied to? I think you're wrong. I think you're wrong.
