## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So Tyler is allegedly in custody and they are told, don't say, don't speak, don't do anything. The feds, you have to wait for the feds to get there to question Tyler. And that didn't happen until the wee hours of the morning. How do we know? Because we're going to hear that from Governor Cox the following morning. Anyways, but apparently what happens is then they bring Lance in. At 11 p.m.-ish, we'll tell you around 11 p.m., Lance Twiggs is brought in for questioning. Okay, and shortly thereafter, that apartment is raided. And I say overnight into the wee hours of the morning is when they first raid Tyler and Lance's apartment.
