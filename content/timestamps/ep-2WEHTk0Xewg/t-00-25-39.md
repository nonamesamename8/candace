## Transcript

> I'm stressing this point to you here because this would signal to you that it would be absolute BS if the feds are gonna tell us bright and early the next morning that the case is closed. They would know nothing. According to Lance's family, this is when they seized his electronics. They say that he's deep on the internet web—that there's definitely gonna be something there. And yet they told us that—quite oddly—Lance gets released right back to his parents. Right—not right back. Lance just gets released to his parents while they're raiding his apartment. Why would they release Lance? Wouldn't you think that you would be detained like for at least 24 hours, right?
