## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I haven't presented a theory as to who was involved. My theory is that we are not being told the truth, and I think that there are multiple people that were involved—including George Zinn. That's my overarching theory at the moment: George Zinn with this decoy thing that makes entirely no sense to me. And it will make sense if there's more people that are involved. So I believe that Tyler Robinson played a part. I don't know which part he played. Curious Nat writes: "Pray this gets used wisely. Rest in peace, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." Nat writes: "They messed with the wrong best friend. You'd think that they would learn. Thank you, Candace (Candace Owens), for changing my life five to six years ago. Christ is king." Indeed. Christ is king, and Christ is truth. And we are gonna get to the truth. Wow. By the way, also—that is a really huge donation. So thank you, Nat, for that.
