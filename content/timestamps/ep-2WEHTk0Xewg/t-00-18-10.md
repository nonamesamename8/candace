## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now I wouldn't say the shooter had fled just based off of what he was—just kind of lurking around where he needed to go get his weapon back, okay? Like for a long time, but whatever. Let's go with that. Then what we have after that 7 a.m. press conference is that exclusively our guys—our resident guys over at the New York Post (every exclusive ever: Jeffrey Epstein's death pictures, Ghislaine Maxwell found at an In-N-Out)—it's always the New York Post, okay? I view them as the feds. Like if I'm the feds and I'm trying to make this seem like this is organic, I wouldn't give it to the New York Post because we're in Utah. And so cops are probably not leaking to a New York-based publication. But whatever, they have the exclusive.
