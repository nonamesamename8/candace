## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Also, remind you guys about 7 Weeks Coffee because it is America's pro-life coffee company. They are on a mission to fund the pro-life movement, one cup of coffee at a time. They just hit an amazing milestone, by the way. Over $1 million donated to the pro-life movement. And we know why they're called 7 Weeks Coffee. It's because at 7 weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean, and it's also the same time a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. That's why they donate 10% of every sale to support pregnancy care centers across all 50 states, providing life-saving ultrasounds, resources for moms in need, and real hope for families. And it all started with one simple idea, using your morning coffee to stand for life. Seven Weeks Coffee is more than a great-tasting coffee. It is mold-free, pesticide-free, shade-grown, low acid, and it's organically farmed. It checks all the boxes.
