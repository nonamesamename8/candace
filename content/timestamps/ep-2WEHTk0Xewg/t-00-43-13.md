## Transcript

**Tucker Carlson:**
> I was shocked and sickened by the reaction of—the ghoulish and really repulsive reaction of—the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu), to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s death. Basically made it all about him and all about his country—immediately trying to take the energy, the sadness, the grief that people felt over Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s murder and redirect it towards support for whatever project he's involved in. And by the way, Benjamin Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu) is not the same as the nation of Israel at all. Benjamin Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu) is despised by many people in Israel. And if you know people who live there, you know that that's true. There are huge divisions within the Israeli government.
