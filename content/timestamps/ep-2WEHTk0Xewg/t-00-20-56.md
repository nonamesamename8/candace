## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The dad says he didn't answer his text messages, but then the father called him, and Tyler Robinson answered. And he tells us that Tyler was suicidal, and that is when they just told him, like, you know, "Calm down. Let's speak to you." They bring over their neighbor—share a friend—and they agree that he should go in. Now... If he was, in fact, suicidal, you don't get that vibe from these messages to his lover, right? There's nothing in here that he's like, "I can't believe what I've done." Now, he slept. We don't know where. He seems to be perhaps on very little sleep. I would imagine he was. He just murdered someone. And he's not indicating in these messages that he's going through any sort of suicidal feelings.
