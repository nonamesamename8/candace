## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So we can then assume that everything else that's about to happen that I'm going to tell you had to have happened between approximately 10:30 and seven o'clock p.m. Okay, I have a source, and everything the source has told me that has happened—and when we were lied to publicly—has proven to be correct. So I am very inclined to believe this source on a couple of other things. And when I speak also to Lance's family, they are confirming what the source is telling me. So we're going to go through this: 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.—all of the things that then took place. So they released the photo, and then we are told—as my source initially told me—that it was the mother who recognized Tyler, and she phones him up. Tyler says, "Mom, I'm sick."
