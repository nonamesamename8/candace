## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> I mean, there are certain parts of the intel world in Israel that do not support some things that Benjamin Netanyahu has done recently. So it's not the same as attacking Israel, attacking Bibi. But I don't think I've ever seen anything lower than his attempt to hijack Charlie's memory and use it for his own political ends, particularly because what he said was completely untrue. Charlie didn't hate Jews. He loved Jews. He had tons of friends who were Jews. He loved the state of Israel. He loved going there. He did not like Benjamin Netanyahu and he said that to me many times and he said that to people around him many times. He felt that Benjamin Netanyahu was a very destructive force. He was appalled by what was happening in Gaza.
