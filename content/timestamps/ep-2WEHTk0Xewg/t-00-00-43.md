## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> When was the last time that you used the word "retrieve" between you and a friend? Retrieve. I'm going to retrieve something. I played this game with my entire staff, and I was able to find, dating back for the last three years, two messages where someone used that term. The first person was somebody that was former military, and the second person was a cop. Makes sense. Okay, we're not done playing this game. Second term that I want you to look for in your phone is "vehicle." Vehicle. I mean, what pops up for you? Is that something that you say? I'm just gonna go outside to my vehicle. I left something in my vehicle. I'll be right back. I just parked my vehicle outside. I don't remember where I parked my vehicle.
