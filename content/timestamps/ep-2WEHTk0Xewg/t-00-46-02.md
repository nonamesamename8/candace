## Transcript

**SPEAKER_6:**
> And so he would text me and say, "Man, I'm really taking a lot of heat for this, and people are really mad." The American Jewish Committee called—in a statement—Charlie (Charlie Kirk) an anti-Semite and quote "dangerous." Charlie (Charlie Kirk), an anti-Semite. He was not an anti-Semite. He was the opposite. And he was not dangerous. He was a great lover of people and a purveyor of peace. He was the opposite. And he was very stung by that. Those of us who've been called names for a long time are a little bit harder to offend. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was deeply offended by that and expressed some of those feelings on Megyn Kelly's show and in other places. But that did not let up. The reason I'm telling this story is because he called me and then came to see me at my house about this topic.
