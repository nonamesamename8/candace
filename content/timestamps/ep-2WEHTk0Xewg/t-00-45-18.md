## Transcript

**SPEAKER_6:**
> But on him. I have no donors. He had $100 million worth of donors. And so, because he was involved in a different project from just yapping on the internet—which is what I do for a living— he was dependent to a great extent on his donors. Of course, it's a nonprofit. And they went after him and tormented him—not all, of course; many were supportive—but the ones who were offended by my speech—and there was a small, very intense group who tormented Charlie (Charlie Kirk) until the day he died. Two days before he died, he lost a two million dollar donation because he had publicly pledged to bring me to the next Turning Point conference in December. And he told me over the past couple of months he was losing a lot of donations over that pledge. They put out a flyer basically saying that I was going to be at this event giving a speech.
