## Transcript

**SPEAKER_5:**
> We pay tribute to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and we celebrate the tremendous good he did in his life. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) courageously advocated for the sacred principles of freedom, constructive discourse, truth, family values, and common sense. He taught with humor and wisdom, and backed up his beliefs with data and facts. He set a powerful example of reaching out and talking to those who disagreed with him. We mourn his passing, but what he taught us continues to resonate with even more power. A message from all of us at Riverbend Ranch.
