## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Don't take any interviews or make any comments. And if any police ask you questions, ask for a lawyer and stay silent." So that's how it happens. And I want to tell you that we can jump back into the timeline here. Our source informs us that it was around seven o'clock p.m. when everybody locally began receiving the text messages that Tyler Robinson was in custody and that they were going to pick him up in Warner Valley. Now, Warner Valley is right next to St. George, so he lives very close to his parents—is what I want you to recognize.
