## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That's exactly why they hate me because they don't have any ownership over me. They can't fire me. That's it. The person that can fire me is my husband. And I don't think he's going to fire me. I hope not. Geraldine Padilla writes: "Never surrender. Fight for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and fight for freedom." We will. Mia writes: "What do you do when a person has such high morals? They will never do anything that you can use to blackmail them, and they won't take your money to say lies. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) couldn't be bought or blackmailed, and that is why they took him out." That is your theory that you are presenting there, Mia. And I will say this.
