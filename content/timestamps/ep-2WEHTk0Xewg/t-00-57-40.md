## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I think Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a real friend, and he would not have dropped it. He would not have let it go. Least of all because he was being emotionally manipulated by a guy who curiously kept his mouth shut when Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) lied. You knew—if you were really his close friend and pastor—how he was feeling about Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu). You knew—if you're his close friend and pastor—exactly the names of everybody who was intimidating him and how poorly they are misrepresenting the things that he believed. So why don't you focus on being more honest as a pastor and giving as much information as you can possibly provide so that we can continue this investigation? If you can't do this, I'm going to have to ask for your silence, okay? Be quiet.
