## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Before I get into some of your comments and see what you guys are thinking about all of this, I want to remind you about the Wellness Company because you may have—or maybe you didn't—but if you didn't know, then you should—that methylene blue being sold online is the same grade that is used in fish tanks. Did you guys know that? Watch out for low-quality bottles that are untested for heavy metals and made overseas. You can, however, trust the Wellness Company's Recharge, which is a doctor-formulated supplement combining powdered methylene blue with NAD+ and PQQ. This methylene blue is USP grade, ensuring top-tier purity for maximum safety and effectiveness. This is not the sketchy stuff that you will find on Amazon.
