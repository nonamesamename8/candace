## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> There's no way you release that guy, okay? There's no way you release that guy immediately. There's no way that you intentionally purge him out of these messages, okay? The excuse "he's being cooperative" doesn't work. You can be cooperative while you're still being detained at least 24 hours before you would say, "I felt good to clear him as a suspect," especially when you haven't even raided his home yet. They released him instantly, and they said "job done." So I would like more information about Lance Twiggs. Okay, I already don't like that mom received a bachelor of science from Stanford University in psychology. It seems to be a running theme in these Fed ops that there's always psychology somewhere in the family.
