## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's what I just said is meant to be a dig to the donors that are making frantic calls trying to politic this situation under control, because they know I'm telling the truth, okay? Frantic calls from Seth Dillon, oh my God. The truth is that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was under immense pressure and he was facing financial threats over his shifting stance on Israel, over who he was hosting, over—from his podcast to people that were on stage at America Fest—Dave Smith, Tucker (Tucker Carlson). That is reality, my friends. Again, want those people to know your money means nothing to me. I already said no to it.
