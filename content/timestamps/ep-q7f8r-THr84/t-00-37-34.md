## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> For just $28, you can give a mom a free ultrasound; once she gets that chance to see her baby, she will be twice as likely to choose life. PreBorn is on a mission to save 70,000 babies this year, so don't just say you're pro-life. You can actually live it by donating now. Call 855-601-2229 or go to preborn.com/Candace. Again, that's preborn.com/Candace. Telling you guys again about Gno.land, because what if smart contract platforms weren't controlled by the elites or big tech? What if they were instead built by and for real builders, the people like you? That's the question that Gno.land wanted to ask, and that's why they built Gno.land. They started with Golang, which is a language real-world developers already use, and they built a new platform around it.
