## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's transparent, it's intuitive, and it makes sense. There's not some confusing system of ones and zeros. It's open source, so you can imagine GitHub, but designed for on-chain collaboration and composability. Builders actually get credit for their work and they get rewarded every time their code gets used. And that's really the value, not likes, not clout, but actual rewards. Gno.land rejected Proof of Stake, which is a system where the rich run the show. And they instead went with Proof of Authority instead, which is a DAO where contributors, and not bad actors or Silicon Valley, actually call the shots. Gno.land is open, it's fair, and honestly, it's pretty unstoppable. So if you are a builder and a freedom lover or you're just tired of rigged platforms, go ahead and check out gno.land/Candace.
