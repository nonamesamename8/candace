## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> By the way, the person that was in the Hamptons, other people that were at the Hamptons that are all talking about this said Bill Ackman got up and gave a presentation and told them that they shouldn't own property and they should give money to like, you know, stocks. That's how they can be successful. They just want to rule over us all, don't they? Allegedly, that's what he said. Belakman, you can reply. Did you tell people that they shouldn't own property when you gave your presentation on this now infamous meeting in Hamptons, which wasn't publicized until I publicized it? I don't know.

Laura Loom are in too. This is like how Bill, I guess, wins the argument. They're like, Bill gave money.
