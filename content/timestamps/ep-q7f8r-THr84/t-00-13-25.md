## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> They tell us that as they continued their investigation on September 11th, Tyler James Robinson then walked in to the Washington County Sheriff's Office and he is accompanied by his parents and a family friend to turn himself in, okay? Now again, he didn't confess yet, but he's here to turn himself in. Robinson's mother stated the following to police: that on September 11th, the day after the shooting, she saw the photo of the shooter in the news and thought that the shooter looked like her son. She then called her son and asked him where he was. He said he was at home sick and that he had also been home sick on yesterday, September 10th, when the shooting occurred.
