## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> We need every single plausible detail if we're ever going to regain any trust in the authorities, post-Epstein world, okay? We're living in a post-Epstein world. It doesn't fly with us. That's not it, you guys. I have more to tell you. I am going to, I guess at first, let's get through some ads and we're gonna get into Bill Ackman's, I don't even know how to describe it. It's just wandering excuse or wandering answer to our episode yesterday, which really didn't say anything. And I've got more people reaching out to us, people that were at the event, people that were at Turning Point USA. We got some questions to ask and I'm gonna ask all of them because guess what? I don't take money from donors.
