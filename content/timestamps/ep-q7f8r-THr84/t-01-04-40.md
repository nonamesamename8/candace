## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Bill Ackman says he's offering a million dollars to whoever—any information he has—regarding the person who assassinated Charlie Kirk. And then she attacks me, SJ, and she's like, "Bill Ackman gave a million dollars, Candace (Candace Owens). What did you give? What did you give?" I don't know. Two years of my effing life to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), helping him build things. Why is everything about money to you? Why do you think having money makes you a decent human being? Why are you so soulless? What is wrong with you? Do you understand that spiritually something is wrong with you? If your instinct—just so you guys know, regular people don't behave like that. I want you to know, cause you may—I don't think you recognize your own flaws. When regular people have, like, a little tiff, they just have a conversation, okay?
