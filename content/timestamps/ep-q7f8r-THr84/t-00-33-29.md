## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> People are saying who live in the neighborhood that they noticed some unusual traffic. And this individual family member said to me, yup, we are hearing the exact same thing, that they would prod that narrative further. But there was some unusual traffic, a lot of cars that were seen outside leading up to the shooting, in the days before the shooting or the week before the shooting. I'll straighten out that timeline for you and get real specific because I will pin down when exactly this was happening. But leading up to the shooting there was unusual traffic in the driveway where Tyler Robinson and Lance (Lance Twiggs) lived. Cars that were not recognized in the neighborhood. This was not a couple that hosted people.
