## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> I have it on first-person account that on the first day of the retreat, of which there were smaller meetings that took place, and then like, you know, the retreat itself, Charlie presented and he explained that he felt that it was wrong that he couldn't publicly criticize Israel. He apparently used an example that if he tweeted, and again, we're riffing here, but something along the lines of Charlie said, "If I tweeted, 'I think that Benjamin Netanyahu should resign,'" that he would then be unfairly attacked. And Seth Dillon then allegedly pipes up and goes back and forth with him quite aggressively, saying like, yeah, because that would be antisemitic. I heard that after Charlie left, Josh Hammer was upset.
