I want every single text message. I want timestamps. It is conspicuous that you are not telling us when this was sent because it sounds like it's when the campus is on lockdown and he's got to go back and he's got to clean up and then all of a sudden we're in the next day when his dad is getting clued in after the picture has been released.
