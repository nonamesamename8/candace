## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Mia writes, "Praying for your safety. We need truth and I trust only you right now." Thank you. And especially, I want to say thank you to Lance's (Lance Twiggs's) family because I know this is not an easy time for you. And she was telling me, and he was telling me—most people that I spoke to in that family were saying that they were receiving all sorts of phone calls from people that are just looking up their last name and thinking like, oh, you must support this or whatever. They're like, no, like our values, irrespective of politics, these are not our values. We are horrified by this. And remember that. Just remember that. Don't harass people unless you're certain that they would possibly agree with this, and they do not agree with this and they want answers just as much as we do.
