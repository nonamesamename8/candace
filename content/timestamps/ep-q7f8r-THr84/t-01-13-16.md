## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Chips writes, "The text chain from Tyler to his boyfriend? No. No 22-year-old uses perfect grammar in a text chain, commas, and periods." Something about that text chain is telling me we need a little bit more about that text chain. Stephen Carrington writes, "May God and Jesus forever have your back." Thank you so much, Stephen. Bible with Bell writes, "Don't believe these texts for a second. He was worried about leaving evidence, then conveniently texts every detail." Thank you. Thank you. "I do not want to leave any evidence other than this very elaborate text chain that tells you my exact open and closed motive and why I did this and that I acted alone and that you are totally surprised by it."
