## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Don't harass people unless you're certain that they would possibly agree with this and they do not agree with this and they want answers just as much as we do. Chips writes, the text chain from Tyler to his boyfriend? No. No 22-year-old uses perfect grammar in a text chain, commas, and periods. Something about that text chain is telling me we need a little bit more about that text chain. Stephen Carrington writes, may God and Jesus forever have your back. Thank you so much, Stephen. Bible with Bell writes, don't believe these texts for a second. He was worried about leaving evidence, then conveniently text every detail. Thank you. Thank you.
