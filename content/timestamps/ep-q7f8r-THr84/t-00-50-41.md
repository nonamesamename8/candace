## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That is the next day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) sits down and vents his frustration about how he is being treated. Take Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in his own words. And by the way, yesterday we only showed one portion of what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said to Megyn on that show. Go watch the full thing. Remember, he's with Bill, he's with Seth, he's in the Hamptons. Bill just confirmed that gratefully, and then suddenly he's overcome with a need to vent about the pressure that both he and Megyn are facing as people that have traditionally always supported Israel. Let's take Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in his own words. Take a listen. (Clip attribution: Megyn Kelly and Charlie Kirk)
