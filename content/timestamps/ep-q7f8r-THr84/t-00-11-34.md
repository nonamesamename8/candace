## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He appears to drop the item that he was carrying as he hits the ground in a controlled fall. He then picks up the item and runs toward the northeast end of the campus. It tells us that's how they then expand their crime scene investigation. They followed his escape path to the northeast end of the campus where they believe the suspect left campus and entered a wooded area. In that wooded area, investigators found a bolt action rifle wrapped in a towel. So again, there was no disassembly. It's wrapped in a towel; presumably that's how he covered it while he was running. The rifle contained one spent round and three unspent rounds. This is consistent with the facts officers observed at the time of and immediately after the shooting.
