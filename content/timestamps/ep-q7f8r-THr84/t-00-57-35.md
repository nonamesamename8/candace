## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then once Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot, they said, "Nevermind, put it back on the building." Charlie (Charlie Kirk) himself had alluded to a tremendous loss of money coming in and we'll speak about that more. More people are going to come out with information. This is all inevitable. And I'll also point you in this direction. You guys remember Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) recently was on a PR blitz, despite the fact that he was fighting this 96,000-front war because Israel didn't do nothing. He was doing a ton of podcasts in America. He went on to Patrick Bet-David's podcast. He went on to Brandon Tatum's podcast. He went on to the Nelk Boys' podcast. Anybody find it weird he didn't do Charlie Kirk's show?
