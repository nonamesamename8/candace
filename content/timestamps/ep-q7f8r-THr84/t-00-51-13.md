## Transcript

> My contention here is that some in the pro-Israel camp are so knee-jerk about calling you anti-Semitic or getting deeply offended if you say anything that doesn't align with their narrative that it undermines their own cause. And I have to tell you, I find it very irritating. Because I do feel like some of us have earned the right to have some credibility on the subject of Israel and don't want to be called those names when we have some mild pushback on some of the overreaches, whether it's you know, whether they're winning or losing the propaganda war right now—and my contention is they've begun to lose it.
