## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Robinson's mother expressed concern to her husband that the suspected shooter looks like Robinson. So she's calling her husband and she's going, hey, this kind of looks like our son. And then his father agrees that looks like their son. So Robinson's mother explained to the officers that over the last year or so, Robinson had become increasingly more political. He had started to lean more left. He was becoming more pro-gay and more trans-right-oriented. Robinson began to date his roommate, which is a biological male who was transitioning genders. We're gonna get to him in a second.
