## Transcript

> Gno.land rejected Proof of Stake, which is a system where the rich run the show. And they instead went with Proof of Authority instead, which is a DAO where contributors, and not bad actors or Silicon Valley, actually call the shots. Gno.land is open, it's fair, and honestly, it's pretty unstoppable. So if you are a builder and a freedom lover or you're just tired of rigged platforms, go ahead and check out gno.land/Candace. Again, that's gno.land/Candace. Something that my team and I are always craving are beef sticks, specifically the ones from my friends over at Paleo Valley. Paleo Valley makes their meat sticks with 100% grass-fed beef, sourced from small-scale regenerative American farms, so you can feel good about what you're eating and what you're supporting.
