## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He apparently used an example that if he tweeted, and again, we're riffing here, but something along the lines of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said, "If I tweeted, 'I think that Benjamin Netanyahu should resign,'" that he would then be unfairly attacked. And Seth Dillon then allegedly pipes up and goes back and forth with him quite aggressively, saying like, yeah, because that would be antisemitic. I heard that after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) left, Josh Hammer was upset. Josh Hammer, I know for a fact, was a part of the beehive that was swarming him about people that he was having at his conferences. I know for a fact.
