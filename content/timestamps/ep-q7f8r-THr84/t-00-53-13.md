## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Megan, I think I have a bulletproof resume showing my defense of Israel both on campus, on social media, to great, let's just say mockery and scorn at times, right? Because I believe it, right? I believe in the scriptural land rights given to Israel. I believe in fulfillment of prophecy. And again, I'm not a theologian, but I'm a Christian. My life was changed in Israel. The spiritual energy is so amazing there. I want them to win. I've said that repeatedly. And however, Megan, you're hitting on something very potent and important. Now, let me first say, I don't want to judge an entire group because there's been many people in the pre-Israel world that have been very sweet, very kind, very nuanced, very Charlie.
