## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Yeah, these messages are clearly doctored, is what I would say. They're doctored. Now, they could decide why they're doing that. Tyler's being forthcoming or protecting him in some capacity. I find that to be unacceptable. Okay? Unacceptable. I want every single text message. I want timestamps. It is conspicuous that you are not telling us when this was sent because it sounds like it's when the campus is on lockdown and he's got to go back and he's got to clean up, and then all of a sudden we're in the next day when his dad is getting clued in after the picture has been released. They're not telling us that, okay? And you have a right to be a little bit uncomfortable about that, because I'm a lot a bit uncomfortable about that. We need full answers.
