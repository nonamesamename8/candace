## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Again, that's gno.land slash Candace. Something that my team and I are always craving are beef sticks, specifically the ones from my friends over at Paleo Valley. Paleo Valley makes their meat sticks with 100% grass-fed beef, sourced from small scale for Genitive American Farms, so you can feel good about what you're eating and what you're supporting. They stripped out all the junk, so there's no preservative, there's no gluten, there's no soy, there's no dairy, there's no sugar, there's no GMOs. Just clean, nutrient-dense fuel the way that food was meant to be, so whether you're road tripping, working late, or running around with kids, these sticks deliver high protein, Energy, there's no crash. If you're keto, you're paleo, or you're carnivore, it does not matter. Paleo Valley will work with your lifestyle, not against it.
