## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Remember this: we have to support businesses that support us, and Neemee Skincare is one such business. It's clean, effective products made here in the USA, and they have never wavered in standing for faith, family, and freedom. Go to neemeeskincare.com and use code CANDACE10 and you'll get 10% off your first order. In moments like these, we need to be crystal clear about who has our back. This is not left or right. It's good versus evil. And Neemee Skincare is standing boldly with us. Before we get to comments, I'm also going to tell you guys about American Financing because the cost of everything is still out of control. Many of us are relying on credit cards to cover essentials. If that debt is piling up, you're not alone. Americans collectively owe $1 trillion in credit card debt.
