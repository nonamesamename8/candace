## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Well, it's going to be a heck of a Tuesday for us, guys. Where should we begin? I'll tell you this: something is not right. Something is not right. And I am going to need you, whoever it is that's listening to this podcast right now, to wake up, because I am telling you this is not a battle between left and right. We all thought that at some point. We believed that: you're my enemy, you're my enemy. It is not a battle between Russia, Ukraine. I don't care what your political issue of the day is. What is happening right now in the world, and what just happened to my friend Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), is a battle of sheer evil versus goodness. What do I have for you guys today?
