## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You didn't even mention Benjamin Netanyahu at all. You can stand up to him. Does anybody want to jump in and say, no, yeah. The letter Charlie wrote him in May was just like a glowing—he just was overcome with passion and said, I love Israel. You guys are amazing. You're beautiful. We're going to win this thing and you're perfect and doing nothing wrong. Love you, Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu). I just find that weird that no one wants to address the substance of the claims here, whether or not maybe Bill himself has an opinion on whether Bibi lied by severe omission when he mentioned his last correspondences with Charlie. Because I feel like if Charlie said, "I don't want to go to Israel," maybe don't bring up, "I just invited him."
