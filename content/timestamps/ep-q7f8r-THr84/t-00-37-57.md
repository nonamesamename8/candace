## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> Telling you guys again about Gno.land, because what if smart contract platforms weren't controlled by the elites or big tech, what if they were instead built by and for real builders, the people like you? That's the question that Gno.land wanted to ask, and that's why they built Gno.land. They started with Golang, which is a language real-world developers already use, and they built a new platform around it. It's transparent, it's intuitive, and it makes sense. There's not some confusing system of ones and zeros. It's open source, so you can imagine GitHub, but designed for on-chain collaboration and composability. Builders actually get credit for their work and they get rewarded every time their code gets used. And that's really the value, not likes, not clout, but actual rewards.
