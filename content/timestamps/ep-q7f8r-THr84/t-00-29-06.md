## Transcript

> So I go into our tips box and it turns out that actually Lance Twigg's family has tried to reach out to me over the weekend. Obviously I was in a very aggrieved state and I was not prepared to even accept that Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was not on this earth, okay? And I realized that they're saying to me, like, you know, we wanna speak with you and there's more than one family member that has reached out because we trust you and we don't trust the media. Good, good by me. They are, it sounds to me, a very good family.
