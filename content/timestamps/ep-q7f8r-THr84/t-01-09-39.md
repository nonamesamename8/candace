> Wow, 260,000 people watching live. You guys, that is amazing. That makes me feel so good because I know that that number represents the people who are waking up. This is not left or right. I don't care. Do stop trying to make this a trans issue or, right, that whole debate. Slow, guys, I'm telling you. That is not where we need to be right now as a society. We are fighting evil people who rule over us and impact both sides, okay? That's the wake-up call. That's the wake-up call we all need right now. And I hope that people are waking up to that fact as we look into what happened here. Going to get into some of your comments here.
