## Transcript

They share the gospel of Jesus Christ. And most importantly, they stay after the baby is born with real practical support by giving expecting mothers diapers, baby clothes, and even housing and financial help for up to two years after the baby is born. That is what true Christ-centered compassion looks like. And here's how you can be a part of it.
