## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The silence speaks volumes. Now is the time to really step up and support the companies that are willing to be bold, because when they stand with us, they give us the courage to be fearless, and Neemee Skincare is one such company. They have always been unapologetic about their values. They love God, they love family, and they love country. Their products are made here in the USA, and they are committed to supporting the values of our movement. So right now, Neemee is matching every donation that is made to Turning Point USA. You can visit tpusa.com, make your donation, and forward the receipt to faith at neemeeskincare.com. Again, that's faith at neemyskincare.com, and Neemie will match it dollar for dollar. Stop waiting to support those businesses. You can go ahead and head to neemyskincare.com today and start your routine. Don't put it off, just do it. You'll thank me later.
