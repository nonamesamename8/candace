## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Tomi very quickly told us that Charlie was implied that Charlie was penning love letters to him in May. I just love you so much. It's amazing. They were so close. The boys just hit some up like, hey, I know we're fighting this 97,000 front war because we're always the victims, but do you want to just come and maybe stay at my place for the weekend here in Israel? Like that's the vibe that Bebe was rushing to present to the media. So why didn't you do Carly Kirk show? I'll leave that as a question for you guys. Common sense. Common sense, okay? I don't like small lies. And remember, BB started this. I am responding to his shamelessness. Shameless misrepresentation of what Charlie was going through and what Charlie was saying.
