## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Americans collectively owe $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends in American financing but hesitated because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. Well, there's good news. They've created the smart equity loan, which is a solution that is designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike an HLLC, which can have varied interest rates, the smart equity loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high interest debt, free up your cash flow and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210.
