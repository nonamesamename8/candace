I know. I know that I am not supported by the people in suits. I know I am not supported by, you know, Susie Wiles' White House. I know that I am not supported by the donors—the big donors—the Jewish donors at Turning Point USA who are pressuring Charlie. But I know that none of that matters. None of that actually matters.
