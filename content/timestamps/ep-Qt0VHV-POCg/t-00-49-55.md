## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Trust your gut; don't ignore your dreams; don't ignore your intuition. Anyway, some more comments that we have here. Max Hardy writes: "Hey, Candace, I'm 16 and homeschooled."

"And then I will definitely have to get Josh Hammer's book because Charlie supported it and just wanted everybody to read it." No, of course—duh. Like, obviously. Are you kidding me? Like ASAP.
