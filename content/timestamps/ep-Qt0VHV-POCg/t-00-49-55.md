## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Trust your gut; don't ignore your dreams; don't ignore your intuition. Anyway, some more comments that we have here. Max Hardy writes: "Hey, Candace, I'm 16 and homeschooled." "I watch every episode." "We are praying for your protection." "I just got Blackout the Book, Finishing the College Scam." "And then I will definitely have to get Josh Hammer's book because Charlie supported it and just wanted everybody to read it." No, of course—duh. Like, obviously. Are you kidding me? Like ASAP. It was basically his last words, right? And then, you know, that was what he said: "Josh Hammer, sell your book no matter what, man." Also on his list of instructions. Maria Garcia writes: "Candace, what does it mean to be Charlie's David?" I think it probably means that we got to slay some Goliaths. May God bless you. Who knows?
