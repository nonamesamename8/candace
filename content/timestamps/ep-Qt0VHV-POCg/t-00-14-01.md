## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And he decided that October 14th, which is Charlie Kirk's birthday, would be a National Day of Remembrance for Charlie Kirk. Okay? And I'm gonna tell you how I feel about that. Truly, Zionists that infiltrated my book club. You did not need to pay the $9.99 to find out how I feel about this. I don't know why people think I'm hiding how I feel. It's very weird. Like when did people go, "We have to try to listen in to hear what she really thinks"? I'll tell you what I really think. I think it's crap. Okay? What I said in my book club holds. It's never good when the feds are lining up to give you a holiday. Not good. You know, Martin Luther King vibes. I don't like Martin Luther King Jr.'s holiday.
