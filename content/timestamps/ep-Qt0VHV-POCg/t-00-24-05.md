## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So when you purchase from Riverbend Ranch, you are not only supporting the 64 cowboys and their families who work on the ranch; you are also supporting over 260 other U.S. ranches and the hundreds of American families who work on those ranches. So it's born here in the USA, raised in the USA, and processed right here in the USA. Their meat is aged to perfection for 21 days, and it's shipped directly from their ranch to your home. This is not your average black Angus beef. This is more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef that I've ever had. Right now, if you head over to RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code Candace, you'll get $20 off your first order. Trust me, you are going to be very impressed. So visit RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code Candace. I also want to remind you guys about American Financing because the cost of everything is still out of control. There are so many people that are relying on credit cards to cover the essentials.
