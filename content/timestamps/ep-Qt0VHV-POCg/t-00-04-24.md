## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The hardest part of being me is that I came up with Turning Point USA, so I just know these lies so quickly, okay? No, Rob McCoy was not the person who inspired Turning Point USA Faith. Actually, if anybody could be credited with that, that was like way back in the day at Liberty University, actually. Those pastors, those conversations—I was there for those. "We should do like a faith division," whatever it is. He didn't inspire it. And what's so interesting about that entry is that when you then click it, this is how you know this is absurd. When you click the actual notations that are there—when it says he's the co-founder—what are you talking about? Since when is he the co-founder? And it also says that he was the chairman.
