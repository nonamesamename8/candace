## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I was actually desperately looking for a text from Charlie because I know he told me that they—Turning Point USA's organization—had found a guy that could help clean up the Wikipedia pages, right? There are people that do this full-time, and they're paid by bigger organizations to clean up their Wikipedia pages because I remember—and I still have the messages—when we first had our pages, which were made by Wikipedia editors, and they were horrific. They said terrible things about us. It was like, "Candace, this is a racist, white nationalist, crazy person who hates BLM but she hates women," you know, the whole gamut that you're getting right now about me. And we were horrified when we looked at our Wikipedia pages.
