## Transcript

[Donald Trump (Truth Social)]: "Why was the wonderful Turning Point under investigation by deranged Jack Smith and the corrupt and incompetent Biden administration?" "They tried to force Charlie and many other people and movements out of business." "They weaponized the Justice Department against Sleepy Joe Biden's political opponents, including me." "They allowed the daughter of a judge of one of the corrupt trials against me to become the biggest fundraiser for Biden and Kamala, making millions of dollars for herself and her family." "But with her father, the judge, not only refusing to recuse himself, but putting a gag order on me, not allowing any talk about their family corruption and unprecedented conflict of interest."
