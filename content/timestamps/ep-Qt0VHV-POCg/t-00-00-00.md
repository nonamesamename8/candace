## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. Where to begin? Well, the Turning Point USA Wikipedia entry got a very interesting update the night after Charlie Kirk was murdered. A certain someone was mysteriously added to the entry for the first time ever, listed as a co-founder of one of their divisions. That's interesting. I wonder who. Also, I was a bit taken aback. I was obviously away in Wyoming when President Trump (Donald Trump) honored Charlie Kirk with his very own holiday as a posthumous birthday present. But I was a little taken aback that people really believe that that would somehow put an end to the conspiracies. It's supposed to be over now because look—Charlie Kirk Day. Okay, we'll see about that.
