## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I was next to him. It was me and Charlie. What a weird story for Trump to just obscurely pluck out of thin air to say on stage at his memorial. He wasn't there. He had nothing to do with him. The kid had some connections and of course was really sweet and adorable and in fourth grade and super polite and energetic and was like, "I'd love to interview you." I can't remember who the guy was who was his dad. I got him the interview with us. And all of a sudden Trump's just saying the story on stage at Charlie's memorial as if he was there and he wasn't. So what's going on? Regarding Kash Patel showing his face there, I legitimately do not know how these people do it, okay? I would literally die from shame.
