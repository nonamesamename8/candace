## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Pastor Rob McCoy, who had previously never been featured on their Wikipedia page, somehow got his own heading. Just amazing. Let's check out that fresh entry now. It reads: "Rob McCoy and Charlie Kirk founded Turning Point USA Faith (TPUSA Faith) together." "Along with being a Pentecostal pastor in the Calvary Chapel Association, McCoy is the co-chairman of TPUSA Faith." "Aligned with the Christian right, McCoy inspired Kirk to amalgamate Christianity and social conservatism." "During the COVID-19 pandemic, McCoy was known for speaking out against prohibitions on the holding of in-person church services."
