**Candace Owens:**
> If that debt is piling up for you, you should know first and foremost that you're not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing in the past. Maybe you hesitated because you didn't want to give up your low mortgage rate that you're currently enjoying. Well, there's good news because they've now created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. And unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment, giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing today and start saving.
