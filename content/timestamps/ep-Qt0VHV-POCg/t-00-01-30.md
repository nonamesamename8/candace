## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And it relates here to something interesting that I thought of after the show yesterday that I wanted to share with you guys regarding Charlie Kirk as a child. Charlie was obviously an extremely gifted child, so much so that he was hyperactive. He was actually always hyperactive. That never went away. He couldn't sit down. He was never idle. He was always working. But he was so gifted that, of course, doctors immediately wanted to put him on ADHD medicine because, well, why is he so hyperactive? Something's wrong with him. Let's drug him. And thankfully, Charlie's parents said, "Absolutely not." "You're not drugging our son." "He is actually, in fact, gifted." And they instead opted to send him to a school for the gifted. That's my memory. Charlie told me that story multiple times.
