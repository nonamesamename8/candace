## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> When you click it, that article—which they pretend is a note—hit the [54], Skylar, not 55, okay? That's from November 24th, 2024. That's the justification for saying he was a founder. Nowhere in that article does it say that he's a founder or the chairman. Nowhere. They just put a fake article—a real article—that never said this. And they're like, "Oh, now it's sourced. It's here forever because nobody ever does their homework." "And we're Wikipedia. We're Wikipedia." "So you can't question this, obviously." And then you can see the second citations that are used. September—the dates of them—September 10th, 2025. So it's brand spanking new, you guys. Still has tags on it. Less than 36 hours later.
