## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> "Charlie's instructions are actually insane." "Number one, leave me with no help or first aid." That is true. He was not administered any first aid. I have close-up videos of that. Very strange to me because that's what they're supposed to be experts in: no gauze, taking out nothing, not even securing the wound as they carried him to the hospital. And I do not accept, by the way, that it was because things were crazy. He literally pays you millions of dollars a year to know what to do, security team, when things are crazy. Are you still employed? Did you fail at your one job? I don't know. I don't know. We're gonna find out. Anyways, his second instruction—this lady writes—"film your reaction in selfie mode." "Charlie must have wanted it." "It's what he would have wanted," I think. He would have wanted it. I don't know.
