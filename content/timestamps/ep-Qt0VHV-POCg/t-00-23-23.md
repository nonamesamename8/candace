## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys. I've been talking a lot about Riverbend Ranch because I absolutely love their steaks. Their black Angus beef is famous for its great flavor. Riverbend Ranch has taken black Angus beef to a whole new level. Over the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partner ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones and without antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures.
