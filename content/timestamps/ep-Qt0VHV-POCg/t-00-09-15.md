## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And yet somebody was dedicated to Rob McCoy lying and claiming—this person who typed this—that he was the founder, the co-founder, Charlie's pastor. No, he wasn't. The founder of TPUSA Faith, the inspiration behind TPUSA Faith. No, he wasn't. He was one of the advisors put on the board of advisory for TPUSA Faith. I know that he gets paid by TPUSA Faith upcoming pastor summits where they're going to teach other Christian Zionist pastors how to use the Bible as a shield for their political ideas. You know, it says right here in the Bible, "Unfollow Tucker (Tucker Carlson)."
