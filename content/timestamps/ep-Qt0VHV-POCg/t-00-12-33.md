## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The evidence is overwhelming that Tyler Robinson didn't act alone, that Tyler Robinson didn't fire the shot, that Tyler Robinson didn't use a .30-06. Find me just one person with a platform who's pro-Israel and says, "I want this investigation into his death to continue." It's a bit weird, right? It's a bit weird. Dogs—very silent right now. Very, very silent. And there was like a stake in the ground. They're not moving. It's very weird. They do, all of them, however—I will say—want him to be honored, right? Mostly by your money. They want you to give to Turning Point USA. That's the best way, by the way, that you can honor him. Open up your pocketbooks. They don't have enough money there, right?

## Claims Made
