## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That's why I was so interested when I found Neemie Skincare, because they're doing something radical by making things simple. They built one of the most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth, which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils, which means that your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Neemie has two products from their tallow line that you should know about first: your daily hydration. There's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light; it absorbs quickly, and it doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling. They've combined that tallow with soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil, which I love. It's perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind.
