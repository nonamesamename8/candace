## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's a very powerful prayer that we say every Sunday at Mass. And I think that, you know, just the way it starts: "St. Michael, defend us in battle." "Be our protection against the wickedness and the snares of the devil." "May God rebuke him, we humbly pray." "And do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls." Amen. It's a powerful prayer. And we're there. We need protection, okay? But I do think that once again, goodness—light—is going to win.
