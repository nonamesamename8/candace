## Transcript

"Let's add Rob McCoy," who is not known worldwide. Okay, this is even before the memorial event. So you could maybe go, "Oh, well, maybe once he hit the stage and said, 'I'm Charlie's pastor,' somebody went in there and added it." I don't know, guys. My question is who made that update? Who was rather instructed to make that update? Because I can tell you how it works for big companies.
