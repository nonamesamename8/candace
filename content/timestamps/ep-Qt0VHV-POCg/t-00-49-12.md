## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I feel that, and a lot of you feel that, and I'm loving your emails telling me about your dreams. People in Turning Point had dreams. There was one young woman who emailed me and said, "Candace, like, I just have to tell you, the week leading up to this, I had a very vivid dream about so-and-so at the company and six snakes that were around him." And I didn't know that Charlie was going to be assassinated, and this person recounted their dream in detail. And there were many people who dreamed—for whatever reason—the number six was in their dreams in terms of the weapon; whatever it was, it was six—that was appearing. And so I'm kind of going by a vibe that there may be six people who betrayed him by the end of this because there was one too many dreams that affect—from people around the world.
