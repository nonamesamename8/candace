## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Most people are not racist." And then this person is making the joke, maybe Blake (Blake Neff). I didn't look into the Blake (Blake Neff) thing or why he left Fox News because I'm just more interested in his military connections because that caught me by surprise. But you are absolutely on the money. Obviously, we can criticize people. And this sort of cheap tactic of being like, oh, it's kind of the same thing we're talking about. It's emotional manipulation. It's like, whoa, what are you saying? And it's like, no, there is corruption everywhere. And you are not removed from corruption because of who you work for, what you look like, what sex you are. It is always plausible and actually highly plausible, typically when money is involved. Lulu Mallory writes, the more I watch, the more fake and gay things are. We all have been given the light of Christ to discern truth from lies.
