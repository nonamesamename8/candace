## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Bethany Frankel is on Real Housewives, a reality show. And she was referring to one of the housewives who lived her life very publicly, showcased her marriage, was buying tons of Louis Vuitton bags, and they had tons of money. And then when the relationship soured, the housewife basically asked the public for privacy. And Bethany (Bethany Frankel) was like, no, this isn't how it works. We were riding with you on the way up or riding with you on the way out. You don't get to like pick and choose when you want privacy and when you don't want privacy. And subjectively as it... you know, in the matter of Erika Kirk, this is the same person who recorded, had somebody record her over Charlie Kirk's casket. That was not our business, truly.
