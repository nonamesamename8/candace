## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Then five hours later from Tucson, and then the transponder appears to be turned off. However, at 12 31 p.m. on September 9th, it flies from Fort Huachuca to El Paso and then El Paso back to St. Andrews. Now why is that interesting? Okay, because that means the timeline he gave us is exactly right. This meeting took place early in the morning. I think it was what 7 37 where all this happened. And then he's saying, he said he assumed it was like a high ranking congressional person or somebody that potentially could be in the cabinet. This guy is saying that's what that plane is used for. And he also brings an El Paso.
