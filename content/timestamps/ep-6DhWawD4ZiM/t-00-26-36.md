## Transcript

**Tucker Carlson:**
> And yet just last week, what we got from Blake (Blake Neff), and I know he's untouchable, he's in the fam, but I'm gonna go ahead and touch that and say like, this is not okay, the vibe is not right, is making a mockery of it. That is what we mean when we say none of this is passing the vibe check with Turning Point USA. There's no clear answers. There's mockery, there's laughter, but there's no clear answers. And the mockery and the laughter is not working. Neither is this idea that, well, now the widow has spoken. We're not dealing with the widow. We want the CEO and the chairman of Turning Point USA to answer, okay?
