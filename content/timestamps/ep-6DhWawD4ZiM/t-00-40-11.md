## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Adam Neff, and I'm sure captains have different names, but Adam Neff of the 10th Mountain Division is the individual. I sent picture options to him as your emails were coming in, and then someone said, Adam Neff, I sent it, and he confirmed that that is the correct person. There were several, obviously, but Adam Neff was leading the interrogation of him. And it checks out because that is the division from New York. Also, we have now confirmed, and this is exciting, because we got a lot of emails going, oh, if this was really this meeting, people wouldn't have known it was taking place. They would have used an empty building or something like that. Well, guess what?
