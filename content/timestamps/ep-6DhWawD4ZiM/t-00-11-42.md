## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's just an ambassador to India swearing in ceremony. Again, if that's your friend you want to be there, that makes sense. She's also a person and she can decide what she wants to do there. But the point that I am making is that's a coastal flight that she made to be there to watch a paper get signed. She has also made time for an upcoming CBS News town hall sit down with Barry (Barry Weiss), which was filmed today. So. Erika Kirk has time. She has time. It is just what she means to say, not her priority, which is you are allowed to prioritize things in your own life, but this is not a matter of time constraint. It is not her priority to respond to the majority, actually.
