## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Turning Point USA is an organization and Erica already had an uphill battle to climb. Like that she had to climb this because by the way, just because if this was Goldman Sachs and the president of Goldman Sachs or managing director of Goldman Sachs died in a horrifically violent way, the Goldman Sachs family might mourn for a couple of months, but they would have instantly had someone to replace that individual. And beyond that, they would have never accepted the public and the people that are investing money, they would have never accepted, well, he's gone, but here's his wife. She already had a hill to climb here, right?
