## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm sorry, but that whole thing right there is frustrating. And I'm going to explain to you why I just do not accept any of that. First and foremost, the idea that she does not have time. She definitely has time, okay? She's done Hannity (Sean Hannity), she's done The Five, she's done Fox and Friends, she's done Outnumbered, she's done Megyn (Megyn Kelly) Live. She sat down with the New York Times. She made time, by the way, in case you don't remember, to fly to DC for Sergio (Sergio Gore) to be sworn into the ambassador to India as the ambassador to India, which feels kind of obscure and not necessarily related turning point USA affairs, building affairs or whatever it is. But sure, that's fine. I mean, obviously you're also allowed to be a person if that's the homie and that's what you want to do. Sure.
