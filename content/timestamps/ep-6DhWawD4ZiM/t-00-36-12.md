## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then we broadened it when someone clued us into the fact that actually these planes have been following Erika (Erika Kirk). You just heard her cross and confirm that. I thought she'd be concerned. Instead, she's gonna tell us on Saturday that she wasn't on the planes. I never said she was on the planes. Why would I think you were on the Egyptian planes? Well, that would be, I don't think that you took off and went to Wilmington, Delaware. I know you didn't go to Wilmington, Delaware on the day of trial for her assassination. I find that answer to be lacking. Okay, that is weird to me. It's a weird answer to give. And by the way, you can fly when you're pregnant. Even if you were on the gypsum, that's a possibility when you're pregnant. I don't understand that part at all.
