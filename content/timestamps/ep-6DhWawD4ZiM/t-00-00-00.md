## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, you guys, now, I wasn't sure about Erika (Erika Kirk). I was waiting kind of a situation for her to be in, obviously having lost her husband, becoming the CEO and the chairman of a company. It's just a lot of transition and it's nice to wait for more information. before you prejudge or just assume, make an assumption about somebody and it maybe is not based in reality. Well, we are getting a lot more of Erika Kirk this week. I'll tell you that because she has been doing the rounds in the media really over the last couple of weeks. And she just gave an interview live with Harris Faulkner on Fox News, where she finally addressed the quote unquote conspiracy theories. And I have to say this because it's true.
