## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Because they want me to stop investigating it, which is making me feel weird that it's always the pro-Israel lobby that's doing this. People that weren't friends with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), okay, are trying to struggle session us into no longer investigating what happened here in order for us to get a clean bill of health of not attacking a widow. It's like, oh, if you investigate, then you're attacking Erika. It's a nonsense. It makes me think that there's something there, right? Like, what are they so afraid of? Why is the pro-Israel lobby in particular so afraid of any incursion into the absurd storyline that the feds are trying to sell us about Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? It reeks of desperation and desperation only exists when there's something to hide. And Israel has not been acting right from the beginning of this.
