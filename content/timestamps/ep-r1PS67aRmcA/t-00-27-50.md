## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Oh, you know, the Turning Point USA that I wasn't a part of. That's how it went down. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was like, yeah, that's crazy that this is happening. He's like, call him out on stage and offer the debate and I will fly him out personally to come debate you on this. But this is how it works. Okay. They send people; they make it look like it's organic. They'll send people to your events and they will have people applaud. That was orchestrated by Alyssa Cordova. Now that she's not at the Daily Wire, I can say that who I was calling out yesterday, but it's so important for people to get this. What is happening at Megyn's events? I will guarantee you people coming and asking her questions and trying to get her to disavow Tucker (Tucker Carlson). That is not organic, okay? That is pro-Israel people that are paid to do it. Honestly, Megyn, if you're watching, you give me the list of your attendees. I'm assuming this is a ticketed event.
