## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like I said, it was a couple of days after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died and I just was not in the mood. But I do encourage you guys to defend yourselves in a similar manner. Now, in that same vein, in case you guys missed this going around, Eric and Lara Trump spoke at a recent TPUSA event at Auburn University. And it's a different era, okay? The post-Charlie (Charlie Kirk) era at Turning Point USA. My guess after watching this is people are going to be less inclined to want to attend these events. And I'm speaking about the guests like Eric and Lara Trump because they are getting pressed now by students about Israel. Take a listen. (Clip: Student Q&A at TPUSA event with Eric and Lara Trump)
