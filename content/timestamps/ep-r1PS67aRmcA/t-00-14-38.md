## Transcript

**Nick Fuentes:**
> People can say, well, I don't like what you say about this and that. I don't like the guys like Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) cannot, will not say "Christ is King, America first." I think they forfeit their ability to lead. I would never listen to somebody that can't say those things. 'Cause I mean, those things are really the foundation of wisdom, which is the love of God, which as you say, goes through the Son, as we all know, can only go through Jesus and oikophilia, which is, you know, your love of your home, your love of your homeland that you reside in, not some other homeland. So, I just want to get that across to you. It's kind of a strange circumstance that we're talking, but that's how I feel about it.
