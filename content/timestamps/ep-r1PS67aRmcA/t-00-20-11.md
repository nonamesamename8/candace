## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> How dare you not make a comment, Megyn, about Tucker (Tucker Carlson)? How dare you not make a comment? I care now about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) now that he's dead. I care about him and what's happening. Candace (Candace Owens, the host) trying to find out who killed him. That's evil. You're lying. You lie when you have nothing left. So the question becomes, what is Ben actually doing here? Because it's certainly not principled. I think we can put that to bed. It's actually also risky behavior when it comes to Ben Shapiro. Like he doesn't usually come out of the gate like that. And I think a couple of things are driving this unforced error. One, I do believe that he is actually scared of Nick Fuentes, okay?
