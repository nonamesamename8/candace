## Transcript

**Ben Shapiro:**
> So I texted him, and I said, "Thanks so much for calling. It means the world. It truly does. Should we do a show together, talking about the DSA threat, Democratic Socialists of America threat, and orienting in the same direction? Happy to do whatever it takes to bring everyone back together for the fight that matters." And Tucker (Tucker Carlson) then wrote back, "Thanks, man. I appreciate it. I'm going to spend the next week or two thinking about how to be most effective. The country is clearly on the brink." I reached out repeatedly. After that, nothing happened. And again, I thought it was a good idea at the time. I think I felt differently after I saw what he did with Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) and after he proceeded, in my opinion, to spend these subsequent weeks doing literally nothing to fight the left.
