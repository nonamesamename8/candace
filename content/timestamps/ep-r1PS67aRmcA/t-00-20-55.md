## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I think that fear comes from guilt. Nick's backstory—don't care what you think about him, you already know I don't like Nick Fuentes because of how he treated me. But the backstory is compelling. I learned the backstory listening to Jeremy Boreing, the former CEO of Daily Wire, sit down with Nick. So right after I've been fired, and I didn't know what Ben and Jeremy admitted that they did to him. And so I think if you artificially push somebody out of the market and Ben has never come out and denied anything that Nick Fuentes has said, also Jeremy Boreing denied in a conversation with him. So we have to assume the story is true. And given what I know about what happens now, I think, and what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was going through, I think we can all realize that Nick was an 18-year-old kid, like he told Tucker (Tucker Carlson), and now the whole world knows this story.
