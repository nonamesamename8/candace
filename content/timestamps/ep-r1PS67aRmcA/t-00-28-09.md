## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That was orchestrated by Alyssa Cordova. Now that she's not at the Daily Wire, I can say that who I was calling out yesterday, but it's so important for people to get this. What is happening at Megyn's events? I will guarantee you people coming and asking her questions and trying to get her to disavow Tucker (Tucker Carlson). That is not organic, okay? That is pro-Israel people that are paid to do it. Honestly, Megyn, if you're watching, you give me the list of your attendees. I'm assuming this is a ticketed event. I will find the people. They'll be from YAF. They will be from some organization. If you let me go through the names, I love an investigation. I will tell you how many people were sent there to go and rouse applause actually trying to intimidate you and to force you to take a position and to make you feel uncomfortable because it's a part of that moral blackmail pile-up.
