## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And so it was actually quite refreshing for me to be like, ah, now everyone gets to see what you are because you're saying stuff that never happened. So we'll start with what he said about Tucker (Tucker Carlson). You should know Ben (Ben Shapiro) has a real thing for Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I don't understand it. It is just, I don't know. It's been going on for a long time. There's something about Tucker (Tucker Carlson) that gets under his skin. I'm not clear on it. I would actually love to hear Ben (Ben Shapiro) speak about that. I mean, people have a Daily Wire non-compete when they're leaving the Daily Wire; they have to sign agreements that they're not going to go work for Tucker (Tucker Carlson) for six months.
