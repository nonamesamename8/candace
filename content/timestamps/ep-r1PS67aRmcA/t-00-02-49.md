## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I wanna say, I was kind of impressed with Ben because instead of doing his usual thing where he sends others to do his dirty work so he can keep his hands clean, he was like, I'm gonna peer pressure Megyn Kelly myself. I'm gonna make her disavow me, make her disavow Candace Owens (the host), I'm gonna make her disavow Tucker (Tucker Carlson) by putting her on the spot and asking her to respond to things that Tucker Carlson never did and Candace Owens never did or said. And you really get to see it mask off because you saw this narrative circulating amongst people who were just absurdly making claims that I attacked Erika. And I know what these organic movements look like. I know how they operate behind the scenes. And I know Ben plays a part in this.
