## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's shining. It's amazing. What's our upside? Our upside is we get to get lectured and told that we're not even allowed to bring up Israel on college campuses or risk being like arrested. You're getting stricter on anti-Semitism laws. Now you're coming in for our speech and you thought that this generation was gonna get behind it because what, Benjamin Netanyahu bought TikTok? The hypocrisy is astounding and you can't survive hypocrisy. So unfortunately, I think four years ago, everyone thought who's going to be the next Trump (Donald Trump) family member that's going to get into politics and galvanize the youth movement.
