## Transcript

**Tucker Carlson:**
> And they all, of course, all had an answer. I think most said Israel. Great. And he said, I wouldn't go anywhere. I'd stay in New York. And if I want to meet Jewish constituents, I go to their synagogues, their homes, or whatever. But I'd be here in New York, because that's what I'm doing. I'm running New York. That's my job. Well, he gave the right answer. He gave the right answer. He gave the right answer, at least. And he's talking. I totally oppose his program. Absolutely. I don't think it works. But he's talking about economics, and everyone else is talking about foreign policy. So he said what I said. I am describing to you why Mamdani (Zohran Mamdani) won, and you're angry that people are assessing why that happened.
