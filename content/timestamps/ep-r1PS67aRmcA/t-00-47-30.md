## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I just, I don't understand it. I'm not offended by anybody sitting down with Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). And I think everybody should be in the free market. If Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) loses in the free market, I want it to be because there was better competition, not because he's just been artificially pushed out. That's the only way that that works. Otherwise, it just, it's immature. It just is immature and it's whiny too. Katie Rabian (Katie Rabian) writes, "Missing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) extra today. We all deserve the truth no matter how awful it is. Please never stop fighting for our brother in Christ. You are in our prayers. May God bless and protect you, Candace (Candace Owens, the host)." I don't care at all about Ben (Ben Shapiro) trying to join people. It's almost like they're trying to peer pressure me. Like there's like this threat, like they want me to say something bad about Erika (Erika Kirk).
