Now, I wanna also show you what Ben (Ben Shapiro) said about me because it's so outrageous and it's so dishonest that we actually should process what is happening here, okay?

Ben (Ben Shapiro) does not have it together; he is very insecure, and he's going on the attack against Megyn Kelly by lying about what I said and then forcing her to react to the evil of what I never said.
