## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> When you're talking about Jews, yes. But if I'm not talking about Jews, then "they" doesn't mean Jews. When I say they want us to believe this or they want us to believe that and you hear Jews, that's your own derangement, right? If I want to say something about Jews, I'll say it. If I want to say something about Israel, I will say it. If I want to say something about Black people, I'll say it. When I was saying during BLM, "They want us to believe," nobody said, "Do you mean Jews?" And so again, it's one of these trash tactics to make people fearful to speak. If I want to say Jews, I will say Jews. I don't fear saying Jews. When I say Zionists run the media, I mean Zionists run the media. People that support the political ideology of Israel run the media.
