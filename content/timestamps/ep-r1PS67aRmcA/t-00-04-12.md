## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and him had a nice conversation on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) then sent a nice text because Ben had called him. And I guess Ben (Ben Shapiro) thought there would be more of a follow-up, and there wasn't. So here is Ben (Ben Shapiro) complaining about that and then spinning it into the accusation that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) somehow supports Mamdani (Zohran Mamdani). I don't know. Take a listen. (Clip: Ben Shapiro)
