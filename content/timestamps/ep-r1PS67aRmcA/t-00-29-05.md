## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I'd say you should come on my platform because my show is bigger now. But we could also do yours. So hit me up. We'll be right back after a brief break. All right, you guys, I've been speaking a lot about Riverbend Ranch because you guys know I love their steaks, Black Angus beef that is famous for its great flavor. Riverbend Ranch has taken Black Angus beef to a whole new level because over the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite Black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches.
