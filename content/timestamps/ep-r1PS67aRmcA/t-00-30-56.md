## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We are already living in a later. You should consider adding gold into your financial strategy. And I'll tell you why. Because when economies wobble, currencies can lose their value and markets can get scared. Gold does not always follow suit, though. Having some gold means that you're not 100% dependent on one system. You have something solid. What you do now can set a tone for later. I teach my kids the value of preparing and protecting and planning. They'll carry that mindset forward. Gold is one piece of that story. I'm not saying that you should dump everything into gold. That would be as misguided as sticking only with stocks. Smart, intentional, balanced investing is what I preach in my own life. Now, if you're thinking, Candace (Candace Owens, the host), I'm worried about retirement, I'm worried about the economy, I'm worried about kicking myself later, then this is a little nudge.
