## Transcript

> And I'll say this, Nick (Nick Fuentes), that I listen to your show quite often. I think you're one of the most talented people out there. And I'm very concerned about some of the things that you're saying. I wish. I think that you're a very gifted communicator. And so it's hard for me to imagine that you consistently miscommunicate some of these things. I'll hope that I'm wrong and yield the floor back to all the people who actually came on here to talk to each other.
