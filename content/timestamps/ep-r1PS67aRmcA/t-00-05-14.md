## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> Again, I say this with sadness because Tucker (Tucker Carlson) used to be, I think, a deeply important part of the conservative push to win. The number of times that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) has mentioned Zohran Mamdani since October 7th on his show is once. And it was in the context of Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) talking about the appeal of Zohran Mamdani. Just by way of contrast, not because I'm a perfect representative here, but because you've talked about Zohran Mamdani a lot, a lot of us have. Since October 7th, I did 17 separate shows on Zohran Mamdani, including four in the last week before the election. Because when you're orienting against the left, you really should orient against the left. So this just makes no sense. It makes entirely no sense.
