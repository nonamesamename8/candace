## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, 911. I wanna report a blood libel, blood libel. I've suffered a centuries-old anti-Black trope. That's how this works, right? Like, if you're in the pro-Israel lobby and you deal with any sort of pushback or flak, you gotta fall to the ground and cry victim. Well, it's my turn now, you guys, because yesterday Ben Shapiro, who was invited as a guest to join Megyn Kelly on her tour, he pretty much just goes mask off, and it's obviously hilarious. He just lies. It's so weird. He just has nothing. So he lies and tries to pressure Megyn to respond to the lies. All I can say is the pro-Israel lobby is down real bad. They're writing fan fiction. They're like, it's like Benjamin Netanyahu fan fiction.
