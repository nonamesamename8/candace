## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anybody want to help me out why it's now different? What could be different now that it was okay when the Daily Wire was open to doing it and then Tucker (Tucker Carlson) did it and now it's suddenly not okay and it's the worst sin that could ever happen to speak to Nick Fuentes? Point number two I'm going to make here is the stunning hypocrisy again, okay, of him picking the topic of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to pretend that he's noble, to pretend like he has to say something even though he's lying in defense of what's happening to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s widow when it is just a fact that Ben Shapiro does a lot of things behind the scenes to stop the rise of Charlie (Charlie Kirk).
