## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Last night, he was gripping the microphone as he would the neck of a Black woman. I'm kidding. Obviously, those are not my quotes. Those are actually direct quotations from Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) himself when he accuses others of anti-Semitism. Whenever he hears anything that he doesn't like about Israel, those are actually his words. This is a real live tweet from Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) accusing any American Jew who is pro-Israel first of a pure form of anti-Semitism. That was directed at Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes), which we'll circle back to. Also, this was a real tweet directed at Ron Paul (Ron Paul). "Ron Paul is manifestly insane. As in previous debates, he is now gripping the pen as he would the neck of a Jew."
