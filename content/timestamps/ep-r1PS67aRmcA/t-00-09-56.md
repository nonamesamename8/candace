## Transcript

**Ben Shapiro:**
> We're in a business where people comment on what we say publicly. Again, this is why I think you and I differ on our angle with regard to, for example, Candace Owens (the host). I think that what Candace Owens (the host) is doing right now is evil. It is evil what she is doing right now. Okay, and I say that again. Because I didn't waffle on whether it's evil or not, but my position is it's really none of my business. And I have a question: What? Why is it none of your business? I mean, you comment on these things for a living. I'm not mother of the internet. No, but if this were on the left and somebody were accusing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) of his wife having murdered him, I assume that you would be talking about it. Is that what Candace (Candace Owens, the host) is accusing Erika (Erika Kirk) of? Yes, I of murdering her own husband?
