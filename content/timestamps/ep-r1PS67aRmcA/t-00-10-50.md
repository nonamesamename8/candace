## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's so crazy. He's not even anywhere near what's happened. Anybody who's watched this show, I actually was getting flak from my audience for not covering Erika's past or speaking about her parents. I said she gave one of the most consequential speeches, and I have focused my investigation on Turning Point USA and why they're telling certain lies. Seth Dillon, I told the truth that Seth Dillon lied about the Hamptons meeting and that he was pushing; he was pressuring Charlie (Charlie Kirk) about the topic of Israel. I never once accused Seth Dillon of murdering Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So what's he actually doing here, right? Obviously, there's a lot of layers that we should peel back, and it's important that we do it. The least interesting part of this is the fact that he's lying through his teeth.
