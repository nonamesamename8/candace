## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys, it is officially cold and flu season, which means it's also flu shot season. After everything that we've been through over the past five years, the number of people that are getting that flu shot is at a record low. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective at best, and that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is, of course, a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company. If you wake up with a sore throat or runny nose, you can address those symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit containing ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, a generic Z-pack, and there's so much more as well. It's like having an urgent care center in your own home. I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line at an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold.
