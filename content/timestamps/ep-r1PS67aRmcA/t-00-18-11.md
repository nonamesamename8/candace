## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So this has been, and by the way, like I said, I have hundreds of these messages. And so you have to imagine being in my position when you see someone who did everything he could to kind of stop the rise of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), now trying to struggle session Megyn, who was actually a very good friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) deeply respected her. And towards the end, obviously, she took a very principled position on telling the truth about what he was going through. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) dies and suddenly he's like, I care about this evil that could be happening. Candace (Candace Owens, the host) is investigating who killed her friend and she shouldn't be doing that. I mean, there's no way to spin it. What is his suggestion here? That me asking questions about Turning Point USA somehow means that I'm blaming Erika who wasn't even working for Turning Point USA when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died because now she's the CEO?
