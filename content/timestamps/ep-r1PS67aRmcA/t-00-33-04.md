## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> She's the same age as me. Elle Reeve (Elle Reeve) is her name. And I'm going to be also clear. I got very testy in this interview because it was a couple of days after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was killed. First interview I was giving; just worked out that it was CNN. It wasn't about Charlie (Charlie Kirk), but we had set this up before. And I decided to keep the appointment. You know, I hadn't been sleeping. I hadn't been eating. And this woman, I guess decided that she just wanted to poke a bear. Anyways, she's the one passing around this clip because she thinks it totally embarrasses me and shows that I'm a white nationalist. Take a listen. (Clip: Elle Reeve on CNN)
