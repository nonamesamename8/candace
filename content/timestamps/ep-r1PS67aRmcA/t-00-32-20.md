## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's the exact same process by which the pro-Israel lobby lost Charlie (Charlie Kirk) because eventually you just get tired of being bullied and you start to sense and see that it's not organic and also it's not coming from your quote-unquote friends. I just would never do this. I wouldn't even flash in my mind as an idea that I should text Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and tell him who he should or should not have on his platform or how he should use his platform. It's just not how normal people behave, and they don't understand how abnormal it is. Anyways, switching gears here, I got to show you a couple of clips are going viral right now. And CNN has cut these clips because they think they're embarrassing to me. So there's this young woman.
