## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> This is more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef that I've ever tasted. Right now, if you head over to riverbendranch.com and use promo code Candace at checkout, you'll get $20 off your first order. And trust me, you're going to be so impressed. So visit riverbendranch.com and use promo code Candace at checkout. Also, I want to speak to you about Goldco because what are you doing today to protect your tomorrow? Because waiting until later is just a myth. We are already living in a later. You should consider adding gold into your financial strategy. And I'll tell you why. Because when economies wobble, currencies can lose their value and markets can get scared. Gold does not always follow suit, though. Having some gold means that you're not 100% dependent on one system. You have something solid. What you do now can set a tone for later.
