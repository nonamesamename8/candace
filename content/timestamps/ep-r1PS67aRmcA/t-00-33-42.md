## Transcript

**SPEAKER_7:**
> You can criticize Netanyahu without being anti-Israel, and you can criticize Israel without being anti-Semitic, but some of the themes, talking points, concepts you've used in your criticism of Israel, I'm very familiar with from covering white nationalists for ten years. It's very unsettling for me to hear things like you saying, "Our government is occupied by Zionists, Trump (Donald Trump) is occupied by Zionists, we're an occupied nation." Because like, there's literally a term that's like an '80s, '90s term from white nationalism, ZOG, Zionist Occupied Government. It's their idea that Jews control the world. And I'm wondering, like, are you intentionally referencing those kinds of themes?
