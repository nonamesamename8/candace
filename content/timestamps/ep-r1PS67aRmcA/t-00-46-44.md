**SPEAKER_1:**
> Call American Financing at 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or visit americanfinancing.net/owens. That's americanfinancing.net/owens. All right, jumping into some of your comments here.

I'm mad at her because she's talking to the girl that I don't like. Ben, please stop." I agree. There is something fundamentally high school about it. It's so weird.

Like this was really gonna be it.
