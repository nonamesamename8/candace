## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I don't even know who "he must not be named" is in this story, but I do know that with Ben and Nick Fuentes, it's kind of a "neither can live while the other survives," and Nick Fuentes seems to have survived, okay? Without advertisers, without sponsors, without connections, with the entire media writing things about him, being put on the ADL's list, he has proven to be quite resilient. And it is in large part due to how hard they fight him that people become curious. It's like we're watching kids be bombed. Like, how many people have lost their lives in Gaza? And you're telling me the greatest evil is Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes)? I'm sorry, I think I can survive Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) insulting me. I don't feel the need to wheel and deal behind the scenes or, you know, tell Tucker (Tucker Carlson) not to host.
