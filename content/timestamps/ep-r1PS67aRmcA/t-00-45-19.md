## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line at an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. I simply open the kit, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and get back to life. The kit is a lifesaver, a time saver. It's got thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So go to TWC.health/Candace today and use code CANDACE to save $48. Get it now before a cold and flu season kicks into high gear. Again, that's TWC.health/Candace, code CANDACE, for $48 off. Kits are only available to U.S. residents. Also reminding you about American Financing, because the Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that's great news for American homeowners.
