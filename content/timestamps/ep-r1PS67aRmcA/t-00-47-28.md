## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And of course, it always backfires because people go, how immature, why can't Nick Fuentes tell a story? I just, I don't understand it. I'm not offended by anybody sitting down with Nick Fuentes. And I think everybody should be in the free market. If Nick Fuentes loses in the free market, I want it to be because there was better competition, not because he's just been artificially pushed out. That's the only way that that works. Otherwise, it just, it's immature. It just is immature and it's whiny too. Katie Rabian writes, "Missing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) extra today. We all deserve the truth no matter how awful it is. Please never stop fighting for our brother in Christ. You are in our prayers. May God bless and protect you, Candace (Candace Owens, the host)." I don't care at all about Ben trying to join people. It's almost like they're trying to peer pressure me.
