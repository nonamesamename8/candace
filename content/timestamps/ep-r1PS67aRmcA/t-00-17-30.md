## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I said, "I know, he hates it." And he said, "We just have to treat him like noise. He wants you to punch down to him. His respect amongst movement fighters is quite low." I feel like that's relevant right now to what Ben's doing. He wants to egg on this fight because he's lost a certain bit of respect. And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) goes on, "You got in his head, which is terrific. The Ben thing involves me more than he wants to admit." And then we went on and this is the same conversation. He knows that Jon Snow—he's using a Game of Thrones reference—is stronger as the dragons fly higher. And he said it pisses him off. And he is sending his incestuous brother to go try and kill us. It's worse. He views you as my slave, 100%. "Control her" is what he really was saying to me when he called.
