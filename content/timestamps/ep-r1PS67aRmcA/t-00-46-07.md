**Candace Owens:**
> It's hard to think about the holidays when everything's expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. With rates dropping, now is the time to think about paying off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They are saving people just like you, an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in the low fives as a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. And if you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before we know it, so don't wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today. Call American Financing at 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210.
