## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch to raise those calves without the use of growth hormones and without antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. So when you purchase from Riverbend Ranch, you're not only supporting the 64 cowboys and their families who work on that ranch, but you're also supporting over 260 other U.S. ranches and the hundreds of American families who work on those ranches as well. It's born in the USA, raised in the USA, processed right here in the USA. The meat is aged to perfection for 21 days and then it's shipped directly from their ranch to your home. This is not your average Black Angus beef.
