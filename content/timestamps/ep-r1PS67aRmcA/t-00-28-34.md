## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I will find the people. They'll be from YAF. They will be from some organization. If you let me go through the names, I love an investigation. I will tell you how many people were sent there to go and rouse applause actually trying to intimidate you and to force you to take a position and to make you feel uncomfortable because it's a part of that moral blackmail pile-up. And so I'm actually genuinely not upset. I don't care. I believe in the free market. I genuinely will say again, I will always debate Ben Shapiro. If, you know, if Tucker (Tucker Carlson) left you on read and you want to come on this show and you want to debate Israel and you want to discuss Erika Kirk and the things I never said, if you want to discuss your relationship with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), anything that I have said that you would like to dispute, my platform is your platform.
