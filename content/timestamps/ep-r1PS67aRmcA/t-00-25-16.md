## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We can pull back another layer of this onion so you can understand how vicious politics is, because it is vicious. You might remember, maybe you forgot, but I spoke at YWLS in 2024, right after I was fired from the Daily Wire, and a big thing happened and we should never forget it, okay? While I was heading to speak at this event, we learned because there was an intern at the Daily Wire who had a conscience and she felt very uncomfortable with the secret mission that she was put on. We learned that a covert mission was happening where they were sending an intern to ask me a question, okay, to get my answer on the question. And then what was going to happen next is they were going to pass around a clip, but they're going to make it look like she was just a random student.
