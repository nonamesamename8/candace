## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I don't fight. I'm down for the debate. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) says he will fly you out. He will fly you out next week to Detroit and we can do the debate on his stage. Thank you, Turning Point USA. Let's take some questions. Oh, you know, the Turning Point USA that I wasn't a part of. That's how it went down. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was like, yeah, that's crazy that this is happening. He's like, call him out on stage and offer the debate and I will fly him out personally to come debate you on this. But this is how it works. Okay. They send people; they make it look like it's organic. They'll send people to your events and they will have people applaud.
