## Transcript

> But this is one of the things where I feel like it's such a lesson for CNN. This is why nobody watches it anymore. I mean, it's like you're sitting across from a Black person. You're like, "I've learned about white nationalism." And you're using white nationalism. It's not that I'm like, I've known them. It's silly. I've been to their rallies. I've read all their texts. I get it. I know. I'm so glad you're educated. But this is when it's like, put it in a book and anybody will say it. It's just at a certain point you have to use your eyes and go, is Candace (Candace Owens, the host) promoting white nationalist rhetoric? Immediately no. So what else could it be? Could it be that actually Zionism is what it actually represents? What does that mean? Zionism is a political philosophy. Zionist-occupied government. If you look into the history, yes, I believe we are a Zionist-occupied government and we're not the only one. Yes, and I take it to the bank. If you need to walk out of here and say Candace (Candace Owens, the host) is a white nationalist for you to be able to digest it, then that's fine.
