## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If anybody out there is gonna say they, please be very clear on what you mean when you say "they," okay? Because her feelings are hurt, really. She studied it and she knows, she knows people.

Also, Ben (Ben Shapiro) says Republicans should work together against Mamdani (Zohran Mamdani), yet the DW was all about sabotaging all the other conservative media." Like I said in general, everything he was saying there felt to me to be very hypocritical. And I hope that I have done a very good job demonstrating just how hypocritical it is and how they pivot their perspectives.
