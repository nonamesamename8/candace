## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's lost its edge, right? Like MAGA is over. You just know it's over. It's just over. And I say this, by the way, and I'm always very honest to you about how people are behind the scenes. Eric (Eric Trump) and Lara (Lara Trump) have always been unbelievably kind to me. I have nothing bad to say about them as human beings. Lara (Lara Trump) works very hard. And Eric (Eric Trump), by the way, works very hard, you know, running the Trump organization. Certainly, while his father has to go and be president, he took over. They know they're not telling the truth, right? They know they're not telling the truth. The kids are now awake. They know about Jared and his deals with Ivanka and the Middle East and how much money they're set to make. And, you know, Gaza being destroyed is actually beneficial to their bank accounts. It just is. To think these kids and the fact that he was ready to answer about the nuclear—that's always the threat of the nuclear.
