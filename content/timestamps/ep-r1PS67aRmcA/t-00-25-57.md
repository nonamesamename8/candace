## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Let me show you a clip because we found this out. (Clip: Candace Owens at YWLS) I called it out on stage; Charlie (Charlie Kirk) intercepted. We found what her name was. And I called this girl out on stage. Take a listen. You guys, the last thing that I am going to say—strangely, this is such a crazy story—but as I was headed in here, I got a frantic call from somebody. They called me and they said, "Candace (Candace Owens, the host), something very weird is happening. The Daily Wire has sent somebody secretly to record you, an intern, a PR intern, to secretly record you, to catch you in a bad moment, in a bad light." I think that intern's name—no, to be fair, it is never the fault of a person when their employer is sending them to do something that isn't good—but I would really love it if Ariana stood up.
