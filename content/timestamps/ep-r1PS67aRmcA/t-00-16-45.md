## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Hey, Charlie (Charlie Kirk), wherever you are, it's happening again. It's just like, just a smear campaign. I don't know why, but this is what Ben (Ben Shapiro) does. And it is also interesting that when I was telling you that Ben (Ben Shapiro) called Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and he was lamenting the fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I had this friendship and warning him that he shouldn't have me. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) felt like Ben (Ben Shapiro) was like throwing down like slave owner vibes, and he was just like he thinks I like own you or something. But I'm going to show you the text messages because otherwise you'll say it didn't happen. Here we go.

"I'm walking into the White House yesterday, I realized that."
