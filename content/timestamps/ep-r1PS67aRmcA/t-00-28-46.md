## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And so I'm actually genuinely not upset. I don't care. I believe in the free market. I genuinely will say again, I will always debate Ben Shapiro. If, you know, if Tucker (Tucker Carlson) left you on read and you want to come on this show and you want to debate Israel and you want to discuss Erika Kirk and the things I never said, if you want to discuss your relationship with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), anything that I have said that you would like to dispute, my platform is your platform. I'd say you should come on my platform because my show is bigger now. But we could also do yours. So hit me up. We'll be right back after a brief break. All right, you guys, I've been speaking a lot about Riverbend Ranch because you guys know I love their steaks, Black Angus beef that is famous for its great flavor.
