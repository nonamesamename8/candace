## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I'm not clear on what Ben's is, but I sense a tremendous insecurity because it is not a good step to lie like that. OK, and he knew I didn't say it. There's not a chance that he thought that I said Seth Dillon murdered Charlie (Charlie Kirk) or Erika Kirk murdered Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So he's showing his fear. And also, like I said, I think he wanted to bully, effectively bully, Megyn Kelly into a position. And she's trying to come up for air. And she's like, wow, people are cheering this on. Maybe Candace (Candace Owens, the host) really did say this. Maybe she did accuse Erika. That would be horrible. And good for her for not taking the bait and changing the subject instead, because she wasn't certain that I had said it. Melissa writes, "Candace (Candace Owens, the host), as a Black woman, you handled that interview perfectly. If anybody was embarrassing, it was her."
