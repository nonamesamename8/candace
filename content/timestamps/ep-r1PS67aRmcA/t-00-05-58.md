## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He's upset because I guess Tucker (Tucker Carlson) doesn't want to do a show with him in the future. A lot of stuff goes on in the background that you guys don't understand. So, okay, that's on Tucker (Tucker Carlson). If Tucker (Tucker Carlson) doesn't want to collab with Ben, that's on him. Also, it's Tucker's (Tucker Carlson's) platform. So what it means when you have your own show, which I don't know why the shock is, is you can talk about whatever you want. If Tucker (Tucker Carlson) wants to do six months and he just wants to cover sports, it's his prerogative, and people can tune in or they can tune out. That's what the free market means. The free market does not mean that the very same people who tried to artificially push Tucker (Tucker Carlson) out of the market, the same people that applauded him being fired, the same people that have called him an anti-Semite, then get to dictate what he speaks about on his show. That actually just makes entirely no sense. It's not Tucker's (Tucker Carlson's) responsibility.
