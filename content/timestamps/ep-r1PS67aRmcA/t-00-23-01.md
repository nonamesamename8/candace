## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I just don't care. It's just really not my business. It's just really not my business. I'm like, Megyn (Megyn Kelly), I just don't care. Like, okay, if somebody wants to be a fan, they can be a fan of Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). And I sense an insecurity here in the fact that 10 years on from when Ben (Ben Shapiro) had this thing that happened to Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) that he tells a story about, now Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) is still here and Ben's (Ben Shapiro's) influence is waning. It just factually is. Another thing that's happening here, and this is on the point of Megyn Kelly and going back to the making it sound like Ben's (Ben Shapiro's) got a popular position about me. I sense that the pro-Israel lobby is on the brink of collapse. They are desperate for allies, right? And they're so desperate for allies that they're forcing them away. That's what they're doing to Megyn Kelly, right?
