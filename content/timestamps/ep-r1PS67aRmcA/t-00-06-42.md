## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Tucker (Tucker Carlson) doesn't live in New York City. It's not his responsibility to use his platform to speak about Mamdani (Zohran Mamdani) 17 times. It's very strange. But to the insinuation that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) somehow supported Mamdani (Zohran Mamdani) and said like nice things about him when he sat down with Marjorie Taylor Greene (Marjorie Taylor Greene), here's actually what Tucker (Tucker Carlson) said with Marjorie Taylor Greene (Marjorie Taylor Greene). And you be the judge of whether you think Ben (Ben Shapiro) is being an honest person when he describes it in the manner that he just did. Take a listen to Tucker (Tucker Carlson). (Clip: Tucker Carlson)
