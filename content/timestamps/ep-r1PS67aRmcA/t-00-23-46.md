## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They're showing the world right now they are willing to lie to get what they want. Ben is lying right now to get what he wants. And for whatever reason, the pro-Israel lobby believes that this repeat failed strategy of lying and threatening people is going to work. Now, you might be asking, well, how is Megyn Kelly being threatened here? This is exactly what Ben just did on stage. That is exactly the moral blackmail that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was speaking about in the last days of his life, okay? Ben is morally blackmailing Megyn, right? He's sitting across from her. The threat is her reputation. He's standing there and he's saying, "Candace (Candace Owens, the host) is attacking a grieving widow and accusing her of murdering Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." Will you disavow this evil on the spot? And he's got these fake people going, "Woo, yeah."
