## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's implied he's a Zionist, but there's a lot more that's happening that meets the eye, because Ben Shapiro was effectively the final boss of the pro-Israel lobby, and it's because he never comes out and says what he means.

By the way, you hear the people in the background going, "Woo!" I'm gonna tell you what's happening there too.
