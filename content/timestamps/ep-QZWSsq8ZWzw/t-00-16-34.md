## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That was on September 9th, okay. Then came September 10th. Obviously Charlie (Charlie Kirk) lost his life. And a few days later, I was told—and I sensed instantly—that there was like a hive of people that were involved in this. I just knew it. And when it happened, I just went, "Oh my goodness." And my gut is telling me that this was the thing—that the dread that I sensed that was coming out of school. And I had no idea. I am not a flag person at all. And then someone told me—and I was astonished—that Utah recently, extraordinarily, modernized their beehive flag. I had no idea that the Utah state flag is a hexagonal beehive, right?
