And I did something that I had never done. I took Charlie Kirk's credit card, and I was like, "I'm going to find flights and just book it." And then you just figure out maybe it means you're supposed to start, you know, Turning Point UK. There's energy there. That was a part of his vision. He wanted Turning Point to be global. And he had had people that were interested in the UK. And so I actually am showing you this very old text message chain from that time between me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk), where I even picked—I never booked flights, looked at flights—but I booked these flights. And I was like, "Look, the flights are dirt cheap." From NYC to London: $450 in coach or $1,200 in first class. And he's like, "Wow, let's book it."
