## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Which brings me to Thomas Matthew Crooks because that's exactly what we were told—or not told—when, on July 13th, 2024, a 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks climbs onto a roof and tries to assassinate President Donald Trump. Gratefully, Donald Trump did not die, but tragically, one of his supporters did, okay? A 50-year-old firefighter named Corey Comparatore lost his life trying to save his children. And then we were told virtually nothing. In fact, we were—and I'm laughing because it's so absurd— we were told Iran did this. What? Because they were itching for war with Iran. Like, they're still itching for war with Iran, but like that's what basically was the narrative that was established.
