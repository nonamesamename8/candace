## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So just to add a little color to the story, I think that the people who did this—in what we've learned about those women, as I think they were probably who hired, people that did the hiring—were probably trying to be funny. People that don't believe in spiritual forces were probably just like, "LOL." It's like Vice. It's like, you know, Vice publication. Like, "You know, I smoked a blunt and, you know, listened to the Beatles' music backwards." Like, it's like—they don't take that stuff seriously. So they're trying to be like, "Haha, funny headline." And the person who wrote the article about it said, "I'm not calling on dark forces to cause him harm." "I just want him to wake up every morning with an inexplicable zit." So she's probably trying to be funny, to be fair—but contacted witches who are not trying to be funny.
