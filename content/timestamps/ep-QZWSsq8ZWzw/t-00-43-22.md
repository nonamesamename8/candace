> You said the beehive represents a group that are working together for Christ. Thank you, Warwick Spiller, for providing that. Natalie writes: "Tip: my sister's neighbor is the daughter of a lady who sent the video to police of Tyler Robinson walking down a neighborhood street." "The media is leaving out the part—leaving out part of that video." "It also shows him changing clothes, and he is not alone." "There is a woman with him." Okay, Natalie, hi. Could you send that to me? Can you just write, "Hi, it's me, Natalie," in the tips inbox so I can get that immediately? Please send that to tips@CandaceOwens.com. Natalie, please. I am begging you. He was with a woman? What?
