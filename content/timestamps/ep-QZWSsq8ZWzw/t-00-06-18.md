## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If I just bring in a random person, I say, "Oh, look, Skyler just committed this crime," and Skyler says, "No, I didn't," and he doesn't confess, the police can't just make an arrest. You can't just arrest Skyler. Nothing is making sense at all. It has not made sense from the very beginning, okay? And that's because the feds are involved. And I believe the feds know exactly what happened. In fact, I don't think it's a stretch of imagination when we examine history to assume that they maybe even had some foreknowledge on everybody.
