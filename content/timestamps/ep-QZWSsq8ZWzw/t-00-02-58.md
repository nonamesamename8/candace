## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Yeah. I'm sure. I am sure that they are being just moral. I'm sure they're telling the truth to the authorities. Now, I want to remind you guys. We should take a look at their current case against Tyler Robinson to see if we should accept this narrative because currently there is absolutely no video which shows Tyler Robinson firing the weapon or even taking aim at Charlie Kirk. In fact, the individual who filmed the footage of the shooter on the roof—the lone video that exists of the shooter on the roof—also told me that he doesn't think that Tyler Robinson is the guy. So how's that gonna work for an eyewitness account?

## Claims Made

  - *Follow-up:* Eyewitness testimony in court
- [factual] Eyewitness reported the shooter on the roof to Utah on the campus was clear that the person was wearing an entirely different outfit than the ones that they're currently trying to claim that Tyler wore on that day: tactical gear vs t-shirt and jeans
