## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If you wake up with a sore throat or runny nose, you can address your symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit containing ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, generic Z-Pak, and much more. It's like having an urgent care in your own home. I have a Contingency Emergency Kit, of course— got it from the Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line at an emergency room or to be relying on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. I simply open the kit, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and get right back to life. This kit is literally a lifesaver, with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So you can head to TWC.health/CANDACE today. And you can also use code CANDACE at checkout, and you'll save $48.
