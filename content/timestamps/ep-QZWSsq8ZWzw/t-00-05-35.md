## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, regarding the bullet, the source says that it was too fragmented to match Tyler's rifle, so they don't have even the bullet. And let us not forget that Tyler himself has not confessed to anything. And that part also didn't make sense. He said they brought him in. Bail bondsman puts up a million dollars. Tyler's dad gets the sheriff friend to come over, and they say he did it, and the police come, and they say arrest him. They bring Tyler Robinson in, but Tyler Robinson doesn't confess? So how did you arrest him? Does that make sense? How could you make an arrest if you didn't have a confession? You would have to have evidence, and the evidence can't be "trust my dad, bro."
