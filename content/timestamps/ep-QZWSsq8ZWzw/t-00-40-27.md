**SPEAKER_1:**
> Or just visit AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. Again, that's AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. All right, guys. Let's get into your comments. Reminding you: Shot in the Dark—we have another episode that's going up. We're going to go through the birth control. This might be the worst one. Nexplanon. I don't know if I'm saying that right because I never used it, but I said it right on the episode. Don't worry. Crazy backstory to how that came together. You need to know this stuff. We are fighting people that are evil, and their plans are to poison us and our offspring. If that sounds crazy, you just dive right into Shot in the Dark. And you guys will have book club in a little bit here. I might be about 10 minutes late to book club. I hope that's okay.
