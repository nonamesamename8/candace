## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The bait is to make me as a conservative hate you if you are on the left, and if you are on the left, the goal is to make you hate Candace (Candace Owens) because it allows them to operate in broad daylight. The reality of Thomas Matthew Crooks is going to be a story that we should get familiar with. He was... at both—on the left and on the right. He actually traded sides. He started actually as a Trump supporter. I'm gonna show you—and again, to really impress upon you how much this person had to be on the federal radar— I have an 80-page document, which I'm thinking I'm just gonna drop on my website tomorrow after handing it over to legal, of all the accounts that he made, all the statements that he made. And he was at first very angry against the left.
