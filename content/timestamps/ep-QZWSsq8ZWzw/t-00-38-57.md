## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> the criminals are using your ownership to essentially just drain your equity—or they can even sell your property, and you don't find out about it until you start getting collection or foreclosure notices in the mail. That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock so you can protect your equity and find out today if you are already a victim. If you use my promo code CANDACE at HomeTitleLock.com, you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock Protection—which provides 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes, and if fraud occurs, then their U.S.-based restoration team will spend up to $1 million to fix it. Again, that's HomeTitleLock.com—promo code CANDACE—or use the link below. Also want to tell you guys about American Financing because the Fed has finally dropped interest rates, and that is good news for American homeowners.
