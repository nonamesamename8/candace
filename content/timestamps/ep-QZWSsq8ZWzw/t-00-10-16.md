## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right. We booked the flights, and then suddenly I realized the reason that I had this overwhelming feeling to be there was because I was supposed to meet my husband. And the only thing I can say is that it was an intuition. We describe it that it had to have been God. We just had no reason, no other reason to be there. And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) set up a speaking event with some people that had been interested, and sure enough, we were there to help Turning Point UK get set up. Anyways, this overwhelming feeling. I had never experienced something like that since, until about a week before—or actually 10 days before—Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got assassinated.
