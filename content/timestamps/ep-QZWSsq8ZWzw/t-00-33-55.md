## Transcript

**Megyn Kelly:**
> I learned when I was out in Arizona last week that two weeks before Charlie Kirk was assassinated, the far-left website Jezebel declared that it had a mission to cast bad luck or a curse on Charlie. They wanted to hurt him in some way. They declared, quote, "If the far-right misogynist with a bad haircut wants to villainize independent women, Jezebel is more than happy to be the hag of his nightmares." And they went onto the website Etsy—yes, Etsy—to, quote, "cast a curse on him." Yes, this is actually a thing.
