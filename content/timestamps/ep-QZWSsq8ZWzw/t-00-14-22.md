## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I was just frantic about it. And we made the decision that we needed to homeschool immediately and started the process—pulled our kids out of school and started to interview people. But it wasn't enough. Like, despite hiring more security, despite taking my kids out of school, I still had a sense of dread. The Tuesday—Tuesday night—the night before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got assassinated—I had book club, and I felt like I needed to emphasize to people in book club that it was time to take their kids out of school. Like, "Take your kids out of school." "Something dangerous is happening right now." And I'm going to show you a clip. Obviously this is all behind the paywall of what I said to people that are in the book club. Take a listen.
