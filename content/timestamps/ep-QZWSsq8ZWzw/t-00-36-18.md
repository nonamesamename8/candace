> That's the problem when people don't understand that this stuff is real—that you're saying to a witch, "Yeah, I'll pay for you." "I'm going to reach out to you to pay for you to put a curse on Charlie Kirk." And that witch did that. And it brought—obviously, you can see—they were distressed by this. They consulted a Catholic priest—who I assume would have immediately conducted an exorcism that probably should have been done in the Latin Rite. But I feel like that's just something that people should know because until something happens to you spiritually, you tend not to believe in these things. And like I said, that's a part of this. They very much know what religion they follow—the numbers, the numerology. It makes sense to them, the people that are in control of this world. You should just be very cautious—very cautious—of that stuff.
