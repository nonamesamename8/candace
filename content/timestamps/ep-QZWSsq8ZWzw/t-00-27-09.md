## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I think they find these candidates in schools. And so I wanted to express that to you—that we once again are having a predicament, and we can trace this straight from what they did to when JFK was assassinated, where the feds are obscuring. They are using journalists to obscure. They are putting pressure on government officials. They are lying to the public about everything—except this time it's regarding Charlie Kirk. Which means this time it's not going to fly because I'm not going to allow it to. Let's take a pause here. We're gonna get to something that Megyn Kelly shared on her show about a hex that was put on Charlie Kirk—which is important for us to discuss for a variety of reasons. First, I'm gonna throw it to some sponsors. Riverbend Ranch—I absolutely love them.
