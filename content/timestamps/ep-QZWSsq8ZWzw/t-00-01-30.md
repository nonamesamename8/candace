## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Look, I don't think it's breaking news. I think it's just the news. This is what they do. Well, I have it now on a very well-placed, authoritative source that the FBI is putting an absurd amount of pressure right now on the authorities in Utah and also the rest of the government in Utah to come out and say that the Charlie Kirk case is closed. They want it over. They want Charlie Kirk's assassination to be officially ruled lone gunman. It was a lone gunman that did that. Nobody else is involved. Now, why would they? Why would they want that, right? What are they saying at least to the authorities?
