## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So this sort of doom that I had about an underground happening—I was just like, totally freaked out. It's this. It's a Soviet symbol and the idea of making everybody into a worker bee.

I tell people a must-read book is Inside American Education by Thomas Sowell. It is not left or right. He is just telling you how it all came together—the decline, the deception, the dogmas—and how they are programming our children. You cannot unread that book after you read it because you realize there's no such thing as being too hawkish.
