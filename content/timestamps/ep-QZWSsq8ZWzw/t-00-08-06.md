## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> In fact, the only thing that I have heard that made sense—which did not come from our government, did not come from the feds, did not come from the Utah government, but rather from the people that are on the ground, who believe that actually Tyler was just told to walk and drop off his gun at a neighboring house— that, for some reason, just feels like that might be honest and that was how he participated in this event. But we'll see, because I'm not going to let this go. So we'll see if the feds tell us to just dismiss it as they always do. You know, rather relatedly, something that I want to tell you: yesterday we had showed you a clip of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) discussing our friendship and how he was feeling morally blackmailed over it.
