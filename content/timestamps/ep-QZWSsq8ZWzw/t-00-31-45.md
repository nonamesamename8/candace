## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> I don't think I've ever said this before, but Ted Cruz is right. He's absolutely right. This affects all of us, including him. I mean, think about it. If Ted Cruz can't speak freely, then he can't cast spells on the Smurfs. Even though I don't agree with many of those people on most subjects—some of the things they say even make me want to throw up— it takes courage for them to speak out against this administration. And they did, and they deserve credit for it. And thanks.
