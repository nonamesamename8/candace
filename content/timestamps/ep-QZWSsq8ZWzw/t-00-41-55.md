## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Sia, who writes "Prayers up." Warwick Spiller writes, the name of the Mormon Church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Okay, thank you. I'm correcting that. At different times, it says Mormon. Other times, it says Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But in the founder's story online, it says the Mormon Church. So thank you for correcting that. And you said, "Don't divide us." I wasn't trying. I genuinely wasn't trying to divide you. I just don't know. It was genuinely a mistake. Lighthouse writes, "Some feel that Erika (Erika Kirk) is faking her emotions." "I lost my four-year-old son suddenly in April." "Sometimes I felt so numb." "It's our body protecting itself from extreme grief." "I couldn't imagine having the world watch me during that time." "The pain is unbearable." Yeah, I've seen that. I think we just need to be a lot more gracious.
