## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I said I met the owner of Riverbend Ranch before he was making steaks—actually with Charlie Kirk. And so another Charlie memory there for you. And now—things years later—and I'm reading ads for them on the show. Great people. I also want to remind you guys about the Wellness Company because it is flu season, which means it's also flu shot season. After everything we've been through over the past five years, the number of people that are getting the flu shot is at a record low. Yay. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is moderately effective at best—and that's not even accounting for all the vaccine injuries. There is a much better way to stay healthy. You can grab a Contingency Emergency Kit from the Wellness Company.
