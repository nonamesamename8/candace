## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I mean, that's unbelievably violent. Again, another comment where he was commenting on a YouTube video. He wrote, "I've noticed a lot of liars talking about the truth in this post." "Well, let me know. Let me tell you some truth."

He was a maniac who was obsessed with Trump one way or the other.
