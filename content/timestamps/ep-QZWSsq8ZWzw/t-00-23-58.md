## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I mean, that's unbelievably violent. Again, another comment where he was commenting on a YouTube video. He wrote, "I've noticed a lot of liars talking about the truth in this post." "Well, let me know. Let me tell you some truth." "Everyone of the Trump-hating Democrats deserves to have their heads chopped off and put on stakes for the world to see what happens when you F with America." So you go, "Okay, this guy was a Trump supporter." Then he does a radical transformation around 2020. And this had something to do with COVID. He got very angry at Trump, and he was outwardly saying things where people were reporting them on YouTube, being like, "This guy is absolutely insane." "He is a maniac." "He's a maniac." He was a maniac who was obsessed with Trump one way or the other.
