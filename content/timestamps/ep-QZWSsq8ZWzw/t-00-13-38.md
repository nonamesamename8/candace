> And for some reason, I feel like there is an underground that has emerged at schools. And it's like related to bees. That's what I said. And I messaged multiple people about this. My sister—here are a couple of more text messages to other people. You can look at the time frame here. This is August 30th. This is September 1st. We went off air September 2nd. We were off air. And I started talking about people that were discussing bees in a way that didn't make sense. I'm like, "I don't know if this is drugs. I don't know what it is, but it's weird." And so in a sentence, I just said, "There's imminent danger coming, okay?" "It is relating to a school." "I think it's a communist underground, and I don't know why, but it has something to do with bees." Totally sensible thing to say to your husband. Oh, and we need to hire more security. And we did. We hired more security that very week.
