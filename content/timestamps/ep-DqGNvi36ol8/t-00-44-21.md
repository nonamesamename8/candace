## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So remember, there's only two videos of the quote unquote shooter on the roof, one which was shot from the side where you see somebody crouch down holding a gun. Well, I had a follow up call with the person who shot that video. And I asked him, I was like, can you confirm that you actually saw him take the shot? Because literally he's recording him at 1223, right? He said, no, I didn't see him take the shot. I never saw any recoil. This guy has experience in guns. He teaches people to shoot guns. And he said, and I did not say that that was remember he told us early on. That's not the person that I saw. I saw somebody in tactical gear. And I have seen so much about people saying, yeah, this is the video. I've seen so much so many people debating whether or not he put the gun back together.
