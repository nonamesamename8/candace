## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> But I do know that when I got in touch with this individual and he sent me the footage, my eye immediately gravitated towards another person who happened to be wearing a rune, who is also alone at the event, who I thought was kind of strange, did not duck when everybody else ducked after the shot went off. I think I had shown you that. I'm going to show it to you again. I know I identified him as a young man named Jacob Kasparian, and I'm going to show you that video of him not ducking after the shot goes off. Take a look at this. And we're gonna circle it so you can see it. Okay, that's him. You're gonna see everybody duck. And it's gonna come back up. And he's still not gonna be ducked. He just kind of hits his phone and walks away.
