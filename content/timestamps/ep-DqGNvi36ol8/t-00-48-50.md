## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's what I want. I want people who supported BLM to make up with me and I will accept your apology. Tim Morgan writes, the truth is its own self-evident and unassailable defense. We love you, Candace. Thank you, Tim. Crown Heights Brainiac writes, Candace, please go live when they have their live stream and do a live reaction. Team Petty, I saw that request and we can confirm that we are going to live stream their live stream and live respond to the live stream that is not actually a live stream that's interested in getting to the truth. I also love that they're now trying to cage it like they were doing this live stream to respond. irrespective of me when their entire introduction to this live stream was him speaking for 10 minutes and assassinating my character.
