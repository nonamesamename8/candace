## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So I love situational irony like that, where he is actually live streaming with Andrew Kolvet. It's like, it's not authentic unless it's a person is in person and Andrew Kolvet is literally not in person as he's answering his questions. So I guess the show is not authentic or something. I also love Blake (Blake Neff) because he's trying so hard not to be condescending in that bit. It doesn't come naturally to him. He's extremely condescending. His obvious, how do I say this? We're shocked that you guys believe Candace. We're just very shocked, you dummies.
