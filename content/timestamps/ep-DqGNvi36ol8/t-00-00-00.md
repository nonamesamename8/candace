## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys, happy Friday. Welcome to the end of the week. Get excited because the rapper, the game has dropped his song entitled The Assassination of Candace Owens. And the lyrics are in fact fantastic because even the hip hop world is asking questions and noticing that turning point is not acting right. It's because you guys are just not acting right. Well, guess what? Something interesting has taken place this morning. TPUSA confirmed that the debate request and the sit down request to respond to all of our very many questions actually came from Erika Kirk. They said that request was directed by Erika Kirk and I find that to be compelling.
