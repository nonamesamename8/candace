## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm sorry, I'm not up to date on gang stuff. Either way, behind these bars is shots fly in. Decapitate you sold called goats without trying. Go head to head with CNN while bumping CNN. Leave in France, I'm still alive. Some I won't see again. Seek my truth until I'm in the position that she is in. Moral to the story, be cautious who you believe in. I love this. It's so great. I love that he incorporated France into this and what he's saying obviously is like you have to fight these so-called goats and honestly they are like Baphomet worshipers, okay?

They want to assassinate you. And they're laughing.
