## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The second comment, this user writes, Tyler Robinson can appear in court by video conference, but Turning Point USA says Candace cannot attend their debate by similar means. Yeah, guys, we are starting to notice some things. It's weird. And we announced or it was announced today that Charlie Kirk's show, which they are continuing and which once upon a time enjoyed the number one spot on Apple podcasts has now plummeted, right? This is a tweet breaking news. The Charlie Kirk show has crashed in the rankings falling to number 94 on Apple podcasts, even though it routinely held the top 10 spot in the past and even reached number one when Kirk was alive. The reason for that is simple. It is clear.
