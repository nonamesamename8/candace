## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Fake and gay, I'm gonna hope for the best, but it's already feeling pretty fake and gay. It hasn't even started. So Candy Renee writes, go Max. Anna Rosas writes, Barry Weiss is interviewing Eric Kirk on December 13th. All is lining up with this December 15th show. Barry is going to pressure Erica into disavowing your claims. That way you have to stop investigating into CK's assassination. There's always a reason for everything. I saw some news about Barry sitting down with her. I thought that it was actually that she's going somewhere where New York Times is hosting or CBS is hosting. I don't know what it is. I like to wait and still stuff until things actually happen.
