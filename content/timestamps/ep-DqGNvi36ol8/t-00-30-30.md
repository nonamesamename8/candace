> Actually, 99% of the traditional brands die in your stomach acid before they even reach your gut. And that is what makes Just Thrive's spore-based probiotic completely different. Just Thrive is the only probiotic that is clinically proven to arrive 100% alive in your gut. It does something that no other probiotic can. It turns your gut into an antioxidant factory, creating protective compounds exactly where you need them most, which means better digestion, healthy immunity, more energy, and easy weight management. You can take Just Thrive probiotic in the form of a capsule or a berry flavored gummy. From their award-winning probiotic to their full line of gut immune and brain health supplements, Just Thrive has been fighting to make Americans healthy again with science-backed solutions that you can trust.
