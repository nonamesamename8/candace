## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> In fact, so many of these young men that I was coming across were wearing maroon, that at first I legitimately assumed that it had to have been one of the UVU colors. I asked this question so innocently, I was like, to someone at UVU, I was like, oh, are your school colors maroon? And he comes back and he said, no, they're green and white. So my gut told me, okay, that's interesting because maroon is not exactly a highly ranked color for men. Okay. And it can't be that all of these men that are wearing maroon also happen to have attended this event alone. So I'm going to show you what I mean. I'm going to go back to some of these people. This is by no means everyone. I'm just showing you a few times here. Here we go, we have this young man. This is after the shot. He's wearing maroon.
