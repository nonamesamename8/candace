## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> No wonder TPUSA is failing. No one is buying it. None of them deserved to breathe the same air as Charlie (Charlie Kirk), much less call him their friend. Um, I, I actually, someone, a few of you have commented about, I actually didn't know that Blake Neff used to work for Tucker Carlson. Tucker Carlson was on Fox News. I'm going to ask Zora Carlson about Blake Neff because I'm not feeling his vibes. Remember I said before, I believed him. Now I'm just like, no, now he's just doing too much. Nope. He's a lion. He's a liar that lies. Okay. After extending an invitation and saying, we sincerely invite Candace to join us on the live on the live stream. He then tweets, I don't know if we have the tweets where he just like says, no, it was never meant to be like we know that that's not an invitation. Do you have that tweet? I don't know if I send that to you, Skylar. We can pull it up later.
