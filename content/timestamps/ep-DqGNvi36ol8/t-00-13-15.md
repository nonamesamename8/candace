## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> is if you deeply care about the legacy of Turning Point USA as you all claim that you do, like you claim that you're really just in this, Blake Neff and Andrew (Andrew Kolvet) Kovac, because we were his best friends and we love him, then how can you treat people who are genuinely people just like Gina, donors to Turning Point USA, people who got behind Turning Point USA, people who have photos of them going to Turning Point USA events who probably have tickets to go to AmFest, how can you treat people with such contempt? How could you think they're dumb enough to believe that that was a sincere offer, that that's how it's supposed to work, that that's ever in the history ever of people setting up debates, that that's ever been how it's worked, that someone just arbitrarily picks a time and a place.
