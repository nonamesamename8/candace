## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Are you implying here that she's going to actually be in the chair and she's willing to allow me to bring things and to go over timelines and stuff? Like, can you make that offer through the proper channels? Can you actually say that since you now have more details about how it's going to work? and reopen that offer again, there is no way in hell that George can make the 15th work. I just said it now, he shut it down immediately, and for a very valid reason. And it is not my inclination to go to Phoenix without having my team with me. And my husband is very much a part of my team.
