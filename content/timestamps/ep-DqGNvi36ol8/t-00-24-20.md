## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, regarding Jacob Kasparian, I want to be very clear. I do not think he's shot. Charlie Kirk because it's really fashionable for people to say that we are accusing everyone of shooting Charlie Kirk. No, I am observing some things that strike me as unusual. And it's unusual that he attended the event alone. It is unusual to me that after researching him, he had posted himself earlier that day at either 8.42 AM or 7.42 AM. I'm unclear on whether or not Facebook is editing the time zones according to what I'm in, the times when I'm in or when it was shot. But he's wearing an entirely different shirt earlier that day. It's a dyed blue shirt.
