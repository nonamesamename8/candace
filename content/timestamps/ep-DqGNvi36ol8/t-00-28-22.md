## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Odd, weird and I have a suspicion about the Maroon Boys. I think all of our footage has come from Maroon Boys and A lot of that footage was then algorithmically boosted. And so I would like to, again, show you the pictures of these men. And by the way, guys, there's gonna be someone that just gets caught in here who just happened to wear a maroon shirt that day, I am sure. If that is you, please just write to me and let me know. Like, no chance to go to UVU. And this is just a shirt I put on. They do look military to me, I will say that. And like these three, I just, it's something that I've noticed. And then obviously we know Tyler Robinson notoriously was wearing a maroon shirt. Could be Boy Scouts, could be ROTC, could be Eagle Scouts, could very much be Airborne. So if you guys know anything, please email us.
