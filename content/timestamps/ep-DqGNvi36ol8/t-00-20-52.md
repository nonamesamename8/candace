## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Show you another person here sitting there under the tree after the shot and he's wearing maroon. Show you another person here. We're gonna come back to this person who is wearing maroon because his dad is going to say something publicly. Three people, one shot, all of them alone wearing maroon. We're gonna come back to the guy at the top there. who has the hat, the darker hat on, who's wearing maroon, just like these, like, strapping young men all wearing maroon. We've got this guy in the bush wearing maroon. I could go on and on, this person wearing, of how many people wearing maroon. I even have a video of someone holding a maroon shirt, okay? So I mentioned that quite casually, and that thing happened where there was an overreaction for no reason online, so I knew that I was on the right track, and I should probably keep going.
