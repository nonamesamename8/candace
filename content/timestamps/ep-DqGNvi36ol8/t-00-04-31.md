## Transcript

**Caller (Gina):**
> Okay, my heart's broken with the things that are going on with Candace. And I'm trying to make it all come together. I'm sure I'm not your only fan that is trying to do that because of the relationship that she had with Charlie. And one thing that I'm just trying to make come together in my head is fly. The invitation was extended to Candace, but not to Candace directly. Blake, I think you tweeted something out and I don't know if you know. I don't know what's truth and what's not, but I do know that she said she didn't. She didn't even see the invitation and it was issued Blake.
