## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Every time you call me stupid, it's another little clue that I should follow that. You guys are so obvious, okay? It's the overreaction to simple things. And I feel in my gut that it was not some random coincidence that so many of these fellas decided to wear maroon on September 10th and attend the Charlie Kirk event. And I feel even more compelled because there was this person on TikTok you may have seen at the time who was claiming that he had some videos that someone in his family had shot. And when he submitted them to the FBI, the FBI, had asked him to delete that footage. And I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's false.
