## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, we're going to do something different and actually begin today's episode with comments from yesterday's episode because they are extremely, extremely relevant and they're also hilarious to what we're about to discuss. People who watch the show are obviously savages, absolute savages. And obviously yesterday we were discussing how they rescinded the offer because it had to be in person. Look at this comment, top comment. TPUSA takes them three months to respond. Also TPUSA, you have 24 hours to respond. Seriously, where did this 24 hour thing come from and why was it necessary?
