## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then he arrives, when he arrives to UVU campus, he kind of hits certain points. He's up high and then he's at the lower rung. Two minutes before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) gets shot, he's not where he is. And then the next thing you know, he's there. And the reason why he's not moving is because he's recording and he doesn't duck. And I just found that to be a bit interesting. I can show you, by the way, this is a very grainy image of him recording. We're kind of circling it there. It's okay if you can't see it. We've hyperimposed. But I just found it odd thereafter that nobody, despite him being there, witnessing it and having recorded, by the way, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) getting shot, none of his family members posted anything about trolley assassination. He is active. He did not post about trolley assassination.
