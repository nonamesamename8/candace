## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We also have new merch available on the website if you'd like to buy. I are hated her love at the underdogs on top. I love that. I'm actually going to get the game to sign it for me. Obviously. I just thought that was great. Now that I'm a rapper. Yeah, I think I'm a rapper. I'm definitely gangster. Anyways, you guys also on the website, you can now gift someone a membership to club Candace or to the book club on our website. Just head to the about section. You'll scroll down and you will see the want to gift a membership tab. Enjoy. I think that's great. I think that's very fun, especially for the book club. We really get into it. We get into a lot of trouble, but it's fun and it's way more laid back because I'm not worried about getting struck on YouTube.
