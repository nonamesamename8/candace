## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> My husband was and led part of the QRF, Quick Reaction Force Team, when they were deployed in Iraq. We are retired now. The maroon color in the military means the color is famously associated with military forces such as the Maroon Beret of airborne troops around the world. And another person explained to me that especially in coordinated violent scenes, making sure that people are in certain colors or in something that is identifiable is important so that military men can observe who to protect or who they're looking for, right? And so that just makes sense, okay? And so LOL for all of you guys that were saying I'm stupid. I love being called stupid.
