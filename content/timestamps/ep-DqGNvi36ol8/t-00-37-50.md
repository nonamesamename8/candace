## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> For whatever reason, our governments think that it is a dramatic ask. Like we're almost saying it's okay, we'll be employees and debt slaves for the rest of our lives. We'll get back to work and we'll pay absurd taxes every day. Can you guys please just leave kids alone? And our government's like, mm-mm. Can't do that, sorry. Could you please just not poison us? Government's like, mm-mm. Sorry, we can't do that. You guys are asking for way too much. You're listening to too much Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens. It's too much for you guys. How could you think that we don't have a right to poison you and to poison the minds of your children? It is, like I said, I think such a good commentary.
