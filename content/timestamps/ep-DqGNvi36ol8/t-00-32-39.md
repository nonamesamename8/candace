## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like they went to film him in Salt Lake City. I just would like to know how these media requests came about. Like, did he tweet something and you knew he was there? Like, actually, if you are PBS, which I'm about to show you a clip of him speaking on PBS, how did you know to reach out to this man? That's the first question I'd like to have answered, right? Because I'm thinking, if I'm sending people down, I'm not sending them to Salt Lake City, right? I'm gonna send people a truck down, a news truck down to UVU campus. I'm gonna go around and try to speak to people on campus organically, people that are students and attended this event.
