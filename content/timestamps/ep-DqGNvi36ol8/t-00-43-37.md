## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, let's get into some of your comments for today. LaughingCats writes, that's by the way, a very big donation. Thank you. Holla at our girl Candace supporting her y'all. I think we need to remind the world that a news station at the CK Memorial talked to attendees for three hours and none of them believed the FBI narrative. TPUSA can blame you all they want, but you are not changing minds. You are speaking to ours. That is so well said. Thank you for writing that, because I feel like I'm becoming a punching bag. All I'm doing is I'm voicing how everyone feels. Like I said, did I collaborate with the game to do the song? Everyone knows that what is being told to us is completely ridiculous. Let me also tell you guys something else I forgot to mention.
