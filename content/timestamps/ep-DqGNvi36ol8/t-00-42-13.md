## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys, especially fellas, Christmas is around the corner. You've got to get your girl and make them a sandwich book. Wrap it up, put it under the Christmas tree. If she opens it and she's excited, she's a keeper. If she opens it and she's disappointed and she feels offended, I just don't know. I just don't know. You guys can get the book on Amazon now. If that's more convenient for you, if you want to get 20% off, you should head to MakeHimAsandwich.com and you can buy it directly from us with no middlemen. And we are also now shipping to Candace at MakeHimAsandwich.com. Signed copies available only at CandaceOwens.com. Oh, I said Candace. We're not shipping to Candace. We're shipping to Canada. Thank you, Skylar. That's a good idea. It'd be weird if they bought books and we shipped them to me. That feels like a scam.
