## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> In the crowd, I'm starting to identify every person there. That's where I'm at. I'm micromanaging. I'm doing my best, Karen, over here. I would like to even find him on the day of Charlie Kirk's assassination in the crowd. His name is Emanuel Bierer, and there are a million and one reasons why I wanted to know more about him. Look, he's a former employee of Oracle. He's in engineering. I believe he's from Germany, from what I looked into. He's a software engineer and he attended the event, but somehow I don't see any photos of him at the event. And he was plucked from obscurity by the mainstream media as an eyewitness in Salt Lake City.
