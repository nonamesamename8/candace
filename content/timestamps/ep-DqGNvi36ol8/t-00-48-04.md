## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I would like to think the Fetcher's smarter than that, but it is being run by Kash Patel and he thinks his girlfriend's music is sensational. So maybe you're right. Maybe you're right. Top class t-rights make things right with black people so that we can throw our support behind you. Quote, no permanent allies or enemies, only permanent interests. Cut the check. I don't know what cut the check means, but I don't know how to make things right with black people. I don't know what that means because I feel like I've always been right with black people because I'm black. So I feel like I've always been cool with everything I said. I just tell the truth. I don't really care how people feel. And so I feel like during BLM, black people were really mad at me because I was telling the truth, but then the truth ended up being the truth. And BLM was a scam and they were buying themselves houses. So maybe black people should make up with me.
