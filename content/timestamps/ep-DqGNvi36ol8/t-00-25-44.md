## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It happened in their backyard. It was a global event. No comment whatsoever that I could find. And I started to wonder, based on where I found these individuals in the audience, I started to suspect, and this is my broader suspicion and theory, which in any investigation you're allowed to do, it might turn out to be wrong, but I am beginning to suspect that our maroon boys in general were tasked with taking footage from predetermined angles. Again, it's a suspicion. I'd like to explore it. And the easiest way for me to explore things and rule things out is to open things up to the public.
