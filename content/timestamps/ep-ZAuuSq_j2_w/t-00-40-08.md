## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Thank you so much, Deb. She wrote: "You may need some help with legal fees." Yeah, yeah. Also Tyler Boyer—fun little update—sends a text or something. They're all just so insincere. I don't know—sent an email and was like, "What's your lawyer's email?" What do you mean, "What is my lawyer's email?" You guys have my lawyer's email. We were in communication two days ago, right? What are you talking about? Go speak to your employees and your lawyer. You know my lawyer's email. Everybody knows my lawyer is Noah, so send whatever you're gonna send. I don't care. I'm not going to lie to the people. I said what I said, and I meant it, okay? I'm sorry, guys. Do I have a bad attitude today? Skylar, do I have a bad attitude today? He said, "I never have a bad attitude." Thank you. I knew it.
