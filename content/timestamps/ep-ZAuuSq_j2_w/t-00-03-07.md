## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So I brought that up because it was just so propagandist—so in our faces. I obviously did not think that this was going to lead back to Turning Point USA, but little did I know that we can add Cam Higby onto our list of brand-new. You know, everyone was just so brand-new on that day. Everyone was so brand-new leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Well, Cam Higby is on the payroll of Turning Point USA, beginning in August of this year. So in theory, Cam Higby—who was laughing off the idea of an assassination attempt—is being paid by the very organization that just had its leader assassinated in broad daylight in front of the entire world. I find that to be interesting. Who directed him to ask that question?
