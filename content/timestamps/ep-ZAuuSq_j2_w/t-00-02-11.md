## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Before we get into their frankly bizarre late-night tweets and ultimatum, I wanted to update you guys and let you know that Cam Higby—remember that weird propagandist reporter who goes to the Pentagon press secretary and is like, "Don't laugh." Okay, right. Don't laugh. And then proceeds to ask if they heard about France's assassination attempt on my life, which I also said that France was on the ground the day—on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. Yeah, this is Cam Higby. Take a listen. (Clip: Cam Higby speaking to the Pentagon press secretary)
