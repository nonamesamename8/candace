## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys, happy Thursday. Fun little update for you. When the clock struck midnight last night and Cinderella's carriage turned back into a pumpkin, Turning Point USA decided it was a good time to issue a confirmation plus an ultimatum, a time and a date for our debate. I should tell you that they did not send me an email. They did not send me a text message. They did not coordinate anything with me. They simply made this midnight announcement and gave it a countdown, 24 hours to respond. So we're gonna discuss that. And let me just tell you, Turning Point is so done after this. You just cannot survive being this disingenuous. We also are going to get back into the Egyptian planes today.
