## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's so obvious. Like, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said that Blake Neff was the smartest person in the world. So you should just accept that, okay? And that's what he told me. By the way, he had a very busy night before. He told Josh Hammer that his book was the greatest thing and everyone should buy Josh Hammer's book. He had that meeting; then he had a meeting with Frank Turek, and he was like, "Blake Neff is the smartest person, and nobody should question Blake Neff." It just—it was a lot. Like it was—he was—they're telling us everything he said the night before, except for when he texted you guys and said that he thought they were going to kill him. Can we get to that part? Okay, we get it. Mikey's amazing. Blake Neff's the smartest dude we know. It's right here in the Bible.
