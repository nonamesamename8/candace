## Transcript

**SPEAKER_5:**
> No one in the United States should be retiring at 65 years old. Frankly, I think retirement itself is a stupid idea unless you have some sort of health problem. I wonder if I slapped the fuck out you, would that be anti-Semitic? Because I don't want to be anti-Semitic. I just want to slap the fuck out you. Shut the fuck up. I'm so sick of you cornball ass niggas trying to stay relevant in front of that fucking podcast equipment. Shut the fuck up. You want us to go to work and grind for the rest of our life while you sit in front of that thing and sound and tell us, shut the fuck up. I speak for everybody that ever woke up on a Monday morning. Shut the fuck up.
