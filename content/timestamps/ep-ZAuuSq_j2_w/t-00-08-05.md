## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> "Yesterday, we made it clear that we would be scheduling a formal response to allegations and accusations that you have made. We have decided that that response will be delivered during a live stream," as he said, a live stream, "on December 15th. Thank you for your response, letting us know that you will not be joining the in-person conversation. We will be proceeding without you." Why are you proceeding without me? To have a conversation that is about me. Why am I getting 24 hours to respond? Why do you need me there in person? If you are trying to be sincere and answer the very many questions that I have brought up on this show, you guys weren't even sincere in what you said yesterday.
