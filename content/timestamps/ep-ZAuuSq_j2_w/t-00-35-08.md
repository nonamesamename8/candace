## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You need to put that all aside and vote for whoever the hell Tim Pool tells you to vote for. I just want to platform that idea. I think, I think obviously there's something wrong with me and Tim Pool's got it figured out. His soul seems like it's really intact and it's not for sale at all. Anyways, we'll take a quick break and get into your comments. Also, of course, I want to tell you guys about Neeme Skin Care because it is cold outside. December is here, the weather is dry, and if you are anything like me, your skin is probably feeling it. This is the time of the year when we all need a little extra help keeping our skin moisturized, healthy, and glowing. And let me tell you guys that I love what Neeme Skin Care is doing this Christmas season because while every other brand tiptoes around on eggshells trying to be inclusive with their happy holidays messaging, Neeme said, absolutely not. Their entire website is decked out for Christmas.
