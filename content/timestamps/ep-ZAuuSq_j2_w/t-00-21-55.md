**Candace Owens:**
> And there is one trusted solution out there that I trust to take care of my liver health, and that is Dose. Dose is a powerful all-in-one wellness shot that helps support gut health, immunity, energy, and all the stuff that really matters when you don't have time to slow down. And let's be honest: when you have a big and busy family, slowing down is not always an option. It takes me literally five seconds in the morning, and I feel the difference all day long. Their best seller is Dose for Your Liver. It was formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion, and maintain your body's filter. Dose's clinical results showed lowering liver enzyme levels by 50% in most of their participants. One shot of Dose for Your Liver is equivalent to 17 shots of turmeric juice. Dose is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, and it's vegan.
