## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All Riverbend Ranch cattle were born and raised right here in the USA. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. The beef is processed right at the ranch in their award-winning USDA-inspected processing facility, so you avoid the costly middlemen because the beef is sent directly from their ranch to your home. And I love supporting American ranchers. Right now when you order from RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code Candace, you'll get $20 off your first order. That's RiverbendRanch.com with promo code Candace. Also, I want to tell you guys about Dose because the modern day diet is taking a toll on all Americans. Processed foods, hidden ingredients, sugar in practically everything. We are seeing liver health concerns rise in the U.S. because of this.
