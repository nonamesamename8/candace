And now they're angry because they also were going to whip the horse—the ghost of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—and say, "We still need you to shore up votes." And this inconvenience that people who actually cared about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and saw him as a—I don't know—human being, a human being, want to know why he was publicly executed in front of us and why we're being lied to about everything.
