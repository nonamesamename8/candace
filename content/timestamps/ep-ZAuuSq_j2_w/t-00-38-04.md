## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And if you're looking for a signed copy, that is only available at CandaceOwens.com. Um, yeah. I need to start promoting my book more on social media. I want to get that to number one on Amazon. Uh, we also have some new merch on the website, which I think you guys will love. "We don't know what we know" in different colors—which is obviously Christmas around the corner. So that will be fun. I was going to sign some t-shirts, but honestly that was really hard. It's much harder than it sounds. It takes a lot of time to sign a t-shirt. And I'm reminding you guys: you can gift someone a membership to Club Candace and to our book club on the website now, which is new. You just scroll to the "want to gift a membership" section, and you can do that.
