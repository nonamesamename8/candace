## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I respond to him and I say, "This is kind of weird how you didn't email or call me to ask about times or availability and instead chose to tweet this confirmation out at midnight. Why am I learning about this on X? December 15th does not work in person, and 2 p.m. happens to also be the literal time that I do my podcast live every day, which you knew. But we will happily cancel the daily podcast, and we'll join you guys virtually instead for the live stream on the 15th. If that works on your end, let's lock it in?" Okay, we're jumping here. Let's make it happen, okay? That's the beauty of the industry. That is the beauty of 2025. You can literally be any place, any time. Just send me a link, right? Any place, any time—we can join you virtually.
