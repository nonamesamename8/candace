## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys, this holiday season express your love with a very special gift of premium steaks from Riverbend Ranch. Their holiday bundles are only available while supplies last, and they're going to go pretty fast. You can order your holiday gifts today at RiverbendRanch.com. If you haven't yet tried Riverbend Ranch steaks, it is time that you definitely did. I have never had a better steak in my entire life. For the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle that focus on flavor and tenderness. They only use the top one or two percent of the entire Angus population as their breeding stock, which produces beef that has much more flavor and tenderness than your average Angus beef. Each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days.
