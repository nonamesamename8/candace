## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Lastly, we have a comment from Jerome who writes: "As someone who has never trusted our history books and BS explanations we get from the government about why things around the world are happening—even if it's uncovered in the U.S., French and Israel were colluding and killed CK—what power do we have to fight the billionaires or the Department of Defense?" The reality is: you got to start in your home, right? There's just—it was a matrix. Take your kids out of school. That's the first thing I say. It made me so happy last night when I went to an event and just ran into this woman who said, "We took my kids out of school, and I heard your podcast, and we couldn't do it, and we were tired, and I have a job, and he has a job, and we just did it. We made it work." And that's what I did. I just did it. And I realized if my sister—older sister—was making it work and getting up at 4 a.m. in the morning—at 3:45— I think she wakes up every day to be able to keep her full-time job plus homeschool her kids. But also when I saw the joy that returned to her life, I was like, "What is my excuse?" Am I tired?
