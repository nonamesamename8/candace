## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I'm just asking questions. But first, after my episode yesterday, I expected—call me crazy— I expected that Turning Point would reach out to me via text, via email; that they would instantly follow up with their long diatribe and be sincere and say, "Okay, here are some dates and some times. When would you like to make this happen? We're going to have this great debate." Rather, instead of hearing anything from Turning Point, I heard from Skylar, my executive producer, this morning via text—which I'm going to show you—that I was somehow already nine hours into a 24-hour countdown that was issued by Turning Point USA. Here is that text exchange with Skylar this morning.
