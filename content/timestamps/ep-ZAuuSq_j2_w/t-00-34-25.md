## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> It's not going to be the fault of, I don't know, maybe actual politicians like Donald Trump, who's the president of the United States, and looked us in the face and said, "Are we still talking about the Epstein files?"

Like, why are you a human? Like, if somebody in your family dies, you need to focus on midterms. Okay? That is the point of a Tim Pool show. It doesn't matter what you are going through at home. I want you guys to hear this, okay? I don't care if you have family members that are dying, family members who have died, if you have children that you care about and maybe don't want to live in a world that's run by pedophiles.
