## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Everyone can see what you're doing. That's what I want you guys to know. It's very clear, okay? I'm not asking people to defend me. You are just genuinely this transparent. So I am sorry that I cannot arrive in person because it's our last week on air before the holidays. I am still very happy—and I will say it again—to make that date and time and place because I'm here, and we have the technological capabilities to make it work. We can move it around, and we can do it even at midnight. I will stay awake, and I will make that work for you at midnight—anytime. Just send me a link.
