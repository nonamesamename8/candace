## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We just hear it—like you can feel it right now. And yeah, they are dangerous. They are dangerous. But the truth will win. And the truth is more powerful than the lie. And I really feel that. And I can't let my kids grow up in a world like this with these demons in control. I can't. This is not a meritocracy. We live in a matrix. Everybody just needs to wake up right now. Oh, look: Project Constitution is in the chat. He said, "I have proof now that Tim Pool uses bots. Stay tuned. Receipts dropping in the next few weeks. Go max. God bless you, Candace." It's good to see you here. You've done some great work, and hope you were okay with me editing on air. I think you thought BTU was BTT, but that's actually okay because now we can connect those two planes at the very least.
