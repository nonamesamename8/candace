## Transcript

> It makes me think about how intentional Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was about saying, "We want this to be a youth organization." He wanted it to be fresh. He didn't want to become the RNC. In fact, he wanted to take over for the RNC with youth and a commitment to truth. And unfortunately, I think now they're trying to turn the apparatus into the same stale—you know—buy your way into the presence of someone; you do me a favor. And it's sad. But I do think that there is goodness, and that goodness is coming from this tragedy. And that goodness is that a lot of people are waking up to how it works. How the whole system works—how the whole matrix works. Okay, comments. We have Deb Skates. That is a massive donation.
