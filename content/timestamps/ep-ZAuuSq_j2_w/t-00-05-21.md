## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now, if it's gonna be once and for all, it sounds pretty final. I mean, I would assume that I would have to contribute so that I could answer back, right? He goes on to write, "We'll be live-streaming, as we said from the beginning. This is going to be a live-streamed event from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s Phoenix Studio. Our offer from yesterday holds. If Candace wishes to join us in person in Phoenix, she is welcome to do so. She can let us know by the end of today." Why? Well, I'm sorry. If you're saying this is happening on the 15th, why am I getting 24 hours to be able to respond to you? That doesn't make any sense.
