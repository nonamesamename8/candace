## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> How odd, guys, that they don't even—they're not concerned about the Egyptian planes. They don't even know how to feign concern. They don't even know how to sell to us—in their best acting—that they care about what transpired on that day. If you wanted to act like you cared, you would go, "Yeah, no, that is actually weird. I wonder what those planes are about." Instead, they're like, "Ha ha ha, Egyptian planes—what we've had to endure, this crazy talk about these Egyptian planes." You should be concerned. And I'm going to give more cause for concern, okay? Because as you guys will recall, two Egyptian planes—got it.
