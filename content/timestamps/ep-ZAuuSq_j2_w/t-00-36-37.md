## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Treat yourself, grab a couple of gifts, and support a brand that actually stands for something this Christmas season. Also want to tell you guys about American Financing because what if you could delay your next two mortgage payments? That's right. Imagine putting those two payments instead in your pocket and finally getting a little breathing room ahead of the holidays. It is possible when you call American Financing today. So if you're feeling stretched by everyday expenses—groceries, gas, and bills that are piling up—you are not alone. Most Americans are putting these expenses on credit cards, and credit card rates are insane—in the 20s, even 30s. American Financing can show you how to use your home's equity to pay off that debt with rates that are in the below fives. Their salary-based mortgage consultants are helping homeowners just like you restructure their loans and save money every month—all without any upfront fees.
