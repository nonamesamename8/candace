## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> spiritual movement in this room when we interviewed Phil Tourney of the USS Liberty. I'll never forget that interview. It transformed me. It was a major turning point in my life. And thank you guys more. I mean, I'm so grateful to you guys, and I hope you know that. I start all of my prayers with gratitude, because I started realizing that sometimes when you pray, you're asking for a lot. But if you start with gratitude of the things that you're thankful for—like, you know, when you come to God and you're like, "I would like to—I'm grateful for my health. I'm grateful for this..." By the time you get through all the things that you're grateful for, you're like, "Man, do I really want to lodge any complaints?" It's a good way to pray. And I always say that I am grateful for the people around the world that believed in me
