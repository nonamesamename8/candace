## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And as soon as you step into the arena and you think you've won, and you start having any modicum of success, the pressure actually only levels up. And people that you thought that you would be allies with, you find to be your enemies. Like, that's kind of the coded message of Kanye's music. But there's this interview that he gives where he says— somebody—I don't know what they asked him—but he responds and he says, "You know, if you're a fan of Kanye West, you're not a fan of Kanye West. You're actually a fan of yourself. You believe in yourself and you think that you can do something in this world." And I feel the same way. I think that the people who think that they're fans of mine— you're not fans of Candace. You believe in yourself.
