## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Definitely never said Turning Point lied, because you never responded. So that doesn't actually make any sense. And this is why it's not good to have lawyers write things out, because sometimes they're not so detail-oriented. What we did was we showed at first that when I plotted these strange Egyptian jets, that they were following Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And that was a concern because I wondered if they were tracking Charlie (Charlie Kirk). We then obviously realized that they were tracking TPUSA Faith events and that many more times they were following and perhaps tracking Erika. You should be concerned about that.
