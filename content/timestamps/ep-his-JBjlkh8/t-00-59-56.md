## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I hope you don't go there in person for your own safety." It is so sad that we have reached a time where you guys are legitimately concerned about my safety, and I get that. I get that. I feel like there is definitely something military that happened when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got assassinated, and I think our lack of comfort comes from perhaps their refusal to acknowledge that, I think. Their response is what makes you guys feel fearful. But truly, I don't think Turning Point USA is so silly and stupid that they would coordinate an assassination on their campus and then think they're going to be like, "That just happened. It was all weird. She ate a bad sandwich or something." But it is sad.
