## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And recently, because the American government wants the world to no longer take us seriously as a nation or something, they decided to undergo a, quote-unquote, "press corps makeover," ostensibly to let in new, independent, more trusted journalists. And some of them are, okay. James O'Keefe, obviously formerly of Project Veritas, he's very much trusted. Matt Gaetz, I like him very much. But some of the people that they let in are almost the exact opposite of trustworthy and are just radically pro-Zionist. Like, they will lie, steal, cheat, and figuratively murder, or I guess literally allow Israel to murder, without asking any questions. And so that's why they're being let in, most notably, obviously, Laura Loomer. She's totally nutty.
