## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> These are questions I think it's fair for us to ask with everything that's coming up and the lack of a true response that we're getting from anyone that has the means to answer these questions. Anyways, you guys, we're almost at overtime here, but in other assassination news, I wanted to mention to you that The Game—who is a hip-hop rapper—is releasing an album, and he has a song on his track list in this upcoming album that's entitled "The Assassination of Candace Owens." I'm having like the best year ever or something. I don't know. Why? Why? Why, The Game? Why's it gotta be song number 13? What's going on? This better not be predictive programming, okay? We know how Hollywood gets down, okay? We're reading your books.
