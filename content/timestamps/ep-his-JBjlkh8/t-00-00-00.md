## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. It's happening. It's happening. Everybody, stay calm. After yesterday's episode, where we went kind of for the jugular with Turning Point USA—because really, I think everybody in the entire world has had enough with the non-response, trying to move on, trying to gaslight us on answering basic details— so we just went for it. And guess what? Turning Point has moved to formally respond to all the things that we have said. And after a very long diatribe in which they wildly misrepresent the public and global investigation of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, they at long last issued a public invitation or a challenge. I'm not sure what it is, but I accept, okay?
