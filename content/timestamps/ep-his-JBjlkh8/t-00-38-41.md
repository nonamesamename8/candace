## Transcript

Allowing Laura Loomer into a national defense complex is actually sort of just an indication of just how committed they are to laundering the reputations of anyone as long as they say, "I support Israel," because Laura Loomer is quite literally so deranged that she once handcuffed herself to the Twitter headquarters because they banned her account, okay?

She deeply, deeply cares about social media in a way that is just unhinged, okay?
