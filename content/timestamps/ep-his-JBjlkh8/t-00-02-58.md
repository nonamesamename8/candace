## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now he is kind of the rotating talent of The Charlie Kirk Show. He was already featured with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on the show, so that's not unusual. But I think we probably anticipated that Andrew Kolvet, who is the TPUSA spokesperson, would have been the person to deliver this message. Maybe, in theory, that should have been his job. Maybe he's traveling. The point is we got Blake Neff, and I want to say—just to reiterate—that I have always maintained that whatever is going on at Turning Point USA, I have not felt that Blake Neff is one of the bad guys, okay? I just have never gotten that particular vibe from him. I believe that when he speaks, he believes that he is telling the truth. And maybe that's why they want him in front of the camera. He's been the only person that has been responding in a way that feels even remotely authentic.
