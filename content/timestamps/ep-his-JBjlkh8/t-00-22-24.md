## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, so the first thing he says there is, we didn't respond because it's beneath us. Like, that's just not the right attitude. I mean, that is an elitist attitude. It is beneath us to respond to the very people who showed up in scores because they were so moved by Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination that they all poured into the Staples Center, right? And poured their tears out and made videos and donated. It is beneath us to not to then respond to questions that you have that are meaningful, because we just think it's so stupid that you would suggest that the feds are involved in an assassination. That's never happened in American history. What? What? So that's a ridiculous thing. The second thing he says there is, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) always said, don't feed the trolls."
