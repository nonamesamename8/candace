## Transcript

**Blake Neff:**
> "For months, we have received hundreds, thousands—I suspect—emails and calls asking us to respond. People have wanted us to invite Candace on the show. But for a long time, our approach was to say nothing. We did that for several reasons. First, first, we thought that her prevarications were so absurd that nobody would believe them. We shouldn't have to answer questions about secret tunnels or Egyptian Air Force planes. That sort of thing is just beneath contempt to respond to. The second reason we've said so little, though, is because there's a good rule of thumb, which Charlie (Charlie Kirk) followed. Do not feed the trolls. Focus on the mission. Reviving America, uplifting young people, making heaven crowded.
