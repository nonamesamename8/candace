**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, so no matter how many times you keep pretending there's nothing there at the Egyptian planes—the whole internet understands that there's something there at the Egyptian planes—especially because you keep pretending like it's not weird. Like, you're just like, "It's not weird." No, this is normal. It's totally fine that these Egyptian planes—and also, by the way, today it broke the Saudi king was on this plane at some point, 2023. We'll get to that later. And you guys are like, "This is totally normal." This is just what happens at UVU. People just lay over into Wilmington, do things. It's just so foolish. You guys have got to stop the gaslighting if you think your organization is going to survive. I mean, some of that stuff is just untrue. Saying that I went after somebody for wearing a green hoodie is not true at all.
