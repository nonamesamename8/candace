## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I think the entire world would like to see this discussion. I think you can do it in Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s honor. We'll sit there. You pick a place and time. We could have done this today, by the way. You didn't have to read all that, okay? We all have tech. We could have done a live stream. We could schedule a live stream. We can raise money for Turning Point USA if you promise to answer every question that I have, okay? And it's not hard. It's not difficult if you are telling the truth to answer questions. When you are emoting so much and you're upset at the inquiry and you're playing this game like you're David Hogg in Hawaii—"I survived Parkland, so how dare you question my authority on anything?"— not a good long-term strategy.
