## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So you notice that's a little—that's like a Snopes tactic. When he says the quote, it's actually not a full quotation. I never said that, obviously, in the context that he put it in—that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s friends, quote, "had to know he was going to be murdered." Did I say the sentence "had to know he was going to be murdered"? Perhaps, but we're going to need to hear the full sentence, because you're trying to context it in a way that is just untrue, and I don't think it's necessary. If you're willing to have a conversation, then you needn't lie about anything that I've said. People have watched the show. They know exactly what I've said, and I tend to stand by what I've said, and I do stand by everything that I've said. Keep going.
