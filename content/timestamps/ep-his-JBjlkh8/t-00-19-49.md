## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Okay, conflating people that are trying to figure out who murdered Charlie (Charlie Kirk) with, like, Antifa is actually objectively funny. That's an unforced error. They should not have included that in the statement. Somebody in that room was like, "Should we say that? Should we not?" And somebody said, "No, we shouldn't say that." And then somebody else in the room said, "No, we should. Let's keep it in." That second person was wrong. That should have been struck from the statement. It's very silly. Okay. It's very silly to attack your own audiences who are concerned, and your own donors who are concerned, and say you're Antifa. If you don't accept this absurd fed slop—if you're not going to drink the fed slop—then you are Antifa. Just not a good idea whatsoever, okay? That is not what's happening here. You are not the victim. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is, actually. He's dead. And to pretend like you are too aggrieved to be able to answer the questions makes entirely no sense.
