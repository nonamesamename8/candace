## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It really is a marker of the times that we live in that you guys truly feel this way. Angie Lynn writes, "TPUSA will lie about everything as they have been doing. Do not trust this for one second. You and your family's safety, money—everything is compromised. Team Candace. Christ is king." James Gray writes, "The TPUSA response seemed fake, calculated, scared. That guy's body language was just completely off, and he was literally speaking from a script." Yeah, he's speaking from a script, but I will say the thing that felt genuine was at the very end when he said, "I owe everything to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." That's when he went off script. I don't know that they remember or know how to be authentic like that anymore. They're gonna find out, because I'm very authentic, and us having a face-to-face—I think it's the best way to answer this.
