## Transcript

**Blake Neff:**
> She has suggested that Michael McCoy, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s chief of staff, knew Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would be murdered, was happy that he died, and stayed silent because he was told he would be the next Charlie (Charlie Kirk). She has suggested Michael is not his real name. It is. I have seen his birth certificate myself. She has called it suspicious that Mikey (Mikey McCoy)'s wife, who works at Turning Point, helped plan the campus tour event where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was murdered, which she didn't, by the way. She doesn't work on campus events.
