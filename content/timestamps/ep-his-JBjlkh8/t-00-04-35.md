## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> She has suggested that Michael McCoy, Charlie's chief of staff, knew Charlie would be murdered, was happy that he died, and stayed silent because he was told he would be the next Charlie. She has suggested Michael is not his real name. It is. I have seen his birth certificate myself. She has called it suspicious that Mikey's wife, who works at Turning Point, helped plan the campus tour event where Charlie was murdered, which she didn't, by the way. She doesn't work on campus events.

## Claims Made

- [factual] She has suggested Michael is not his real name. It is. I have seen his birth certificate myself.
  - *Follow-up:* Verification through public records or official documents.
