## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> If you haven't tried Riverbend Ranch steaks, it is time that you did, because I've never had a better steak in my entire life. For the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. And they only use the top 1 or 2% of the entire Angus population as their breeding stock, producing beef that has much more flavor and tenderness than your average Angus beef. Now, each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. All Riverbend Ranch cattle were born and raised here in the USA. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. And the beef is processed right at their ranch in their award-winning USDA-inspected processing facility. So you avoid the costly middlemen because the beef is sent directly from their ranch to your home.
