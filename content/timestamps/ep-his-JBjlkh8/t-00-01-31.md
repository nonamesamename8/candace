## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> What can I say other than we went max? Pause, reflect. I'm proud of everybody. I'm proud of the world—every single person who was in my inbox giving me tips, the people inside of Turning Point USA who were leaking, the donors that wrote public letters, or donors that didn't write public letters but sent us messages encouraging us to keep going. Today feels like a win, because guess what? It forced Turning Point USA to finally respond, and that was the entire point, okay? That has been the point of refusing to let up even one second in this investigation. They wanted to simply be able to eulogize Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at a big memorial event, and then they wanted us to simply move on, and we didn't do that.
