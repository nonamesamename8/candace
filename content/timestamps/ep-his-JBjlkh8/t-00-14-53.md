## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Okay, so immorality, like financial impropriety, does not necessarily mean that you committed true financial fraud. There's definitely financial impropriety at the company. I would say that if you are representing yourself as a charity and what you're actually doing is evaporating millions of dollars into various LLCs that have your name on it, that would be financial impropriety. Like, you could say I'm a contractor on this LLC and that LLC, I'm not doing anything illegal, but it's inappropriate, it's improper. Most people are not able to read those forms and won't understand what's happening to the $80 million.
