## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Regarding Tyler Bowyer, I'm so glad we're going to do this live-streamed, because I'm happy to present to you the exact name of the intern. And I didn't say that he abused him. I didn't say it was not consensual. I said that he likes younger boys. I don't mean like younger as in they're not of the legal age. I'm just saying they're a lot younger than him. And yeah, I can give you the exact name of the intern that he hooked up with. That person was not at Turning Point USA. But I can also give you more than that as well—as people that are currently working for Turning Point USA who said that Tyler Bowyer—and these are young men—tried to hook up with them after some events. So I'm glad we're going to live-stream that. Keep going.
