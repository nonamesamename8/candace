## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> In fact, I had been so strategic that I had been holding on to certain information, hoping that you would acquiesce to have a public conversation, because I wanna look you in the eye and I wanna challenge you to lie to me, because I care deeply about what happened to Charlie on that day. I don't think we're getting the truth. And I do believe that because you are not forthcoming about the information that you have about Charlie texting you guys and saying that he thought he was going to be assassinated that very next day, okay? The day that he died, Charlie knew that he thinks he was going to be killed tomorrow, and you guys are sitting on that information. So I'm the right person, yeah. I'm the right person to sit across from you and to ask you questions, right? Some things that you told me on that day, they're not adding up.

## Claims Made

- [factual] Charlie texting you guys and saying that he thought he was going to be assassinated that very next day
  - *Follow-up:* Release or verification of Charlie Kirk's texts
