You should be ashamed to sit across from people who did everything they could to stop Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s rise—breaking bread with them and refusing to have a conversation with me when you know that I cared about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Have you no shame? We're gonna find out. You can pick the place. You can pick the time. I say we do it tomorrow. We don't need to plan for this. We don't need lawyers in between us—lawyer statement. It's not how I roll, okay? I don't care about any of that.
