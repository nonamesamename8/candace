## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Instead, you're mentioning the Egyptian planes for the fourth time, so I would like to recommit everybody that is watching this to figuring out what the hell is going on with the Egyptian planes, because they're nervous about them, okay? So many times they're just trying to give the vibe that this is so crazy. No, they are fearful. The Egyptian planes hold the key, and that is obvious even in Blake Neff's statement. But yeah, I am not a troll, okay? And people followed what felt to them as authenticity. And it was not you. They were not getting that from Charlie's closest friends. Why is that? They weren't getting that from Charlie's most loved pastors. Why is that? Don't blame me for the bad energy that you exuded, okay?
