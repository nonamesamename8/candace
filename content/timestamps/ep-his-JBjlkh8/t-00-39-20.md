## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, she is apparently not allowed to own a gun because of various psychotic events that required her hospitalization. But due to her commitment to Zionism—which in a Zionist defense seems like a psychopathology is a prerequisite—the media is now trying to mainstream her and make us think that she's like a serious person. So our government—the Pentagon—decided to credential her at this time. She's a part of the new press corps that we can trust. Laura has probably been one of the more prominent gaslighters when it comes to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. She hated Charlie (Charlie Kirk) when he was alive and now wants everyone to honor him by not prodding the narrative surrounding his death.
