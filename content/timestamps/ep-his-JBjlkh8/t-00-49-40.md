## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And now, of course—especially as we have learned about Delaware and the DuPont-French connection, and the French Foreign Legion non-answer that we're getting, just gaslighting that we are getting—it feels like an even more relevant and rational question to be asking, and somehow made even more interesting now that we know—or that we've learned—and thanks to the internet sleuths and the YouTubers that put this together—that an hour and a half before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated in Utah, Donald Trump (Donald Trump) and Emmanuel Macron had a phone call that has been recorded in Emmanuel Macron's public calendar, which has been released. You can see that he had the phone call with Donald Trump (Donald Trump) at 6—sorry, this would be 6:45, obviously, p.m. in French time. That's 10:45 a.m. in Utah time. 10:45 a.m. Utah time is when they had this phone call. And look, that could be nothing.
