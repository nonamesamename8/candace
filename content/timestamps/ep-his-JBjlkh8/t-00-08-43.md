## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> When you say "suggested," it means that they are interpreting my words. What I said is another fact. They did not issue him first aid when he fell down. There was nobody who pulled out any gauze and tried to stop the bleeding. And they've admitted to that. In a sit-down with Sean Ryan, Brian Harpole said, "It was because of the severity of the injury." I'm sorry again that we noticed something that stood out as unusual, given the expertise and the amount of money that he was paying that was supposed to be an elite team. She has raised suspicions about the head of our technical team because he took an SD card out of a camera.
