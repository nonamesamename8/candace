## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> After everything that we've been through over the past five years, the number of people that are getting the flu shot is at a record low. Yay. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is quote-unquote "moderately effective" at best—and that's not even accounting for the vaccine injuries. There is a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company. If you wake up with a sore throat or you have a runny nose, you can address those symptoms right away with a doctor-prescribed kit that contains ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, generic Tamiflu, generic Z-Pak—much more. It's like having an urgent care clinic in your home. I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line at an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold.
