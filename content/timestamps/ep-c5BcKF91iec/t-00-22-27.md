## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He then sends me a video, and I guess this was supposed to work as some sort of an alibi. I don't know if he thought that I thought that he shot Charlie. I certainly did not think that he was involved in pulling a trigger and killing Charlie Kirk. I actually don't know why this video—I don't know what this video could have done that he sent me other than to make me feel even more uncomfortable. Because the video he sent me is quite shocking. It's also the reason that I knew that Tyler Bowyer was lying when he tweeted, "And this guy was commanded by the police to take down the cameras." He's lying because I have every minute of what this guy was doing—thanks to him having sent it to me, okay?
