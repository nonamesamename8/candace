## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> First, for your daily hydration, there's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light, absorbs quickly, and doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling. They've combined that incredible grass-fed tallow with soothing aloe vera—I love aloe vera—and jojoba oil. It's perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind. Then for the problem areas—for the really dry, cracked skin—they have the Buzzy Tallow Balm. It's an ultra-rich balm that uses tallow and beeswax to create a protective barrier. It locks in moisture. It shields your skin from the elements and allows it to heal. This is skin care the way that it was meant to be—which is simple, pure, powerfully effective. It's a focus on skin-loving ingredients made right here in the USA. So go to nimiskincare.com, explore their tallow line, and don't forget to use my code CANDACE10 at checkout, and you'll get 10% off your order.
