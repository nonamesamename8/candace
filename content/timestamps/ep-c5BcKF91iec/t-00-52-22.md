## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I think you—and Amal—I know what that says. It was a dark time, but in hindsight, it's clearly what was happening. Amal, it actually—I think it all started with Kanye tweeting me. I think handlers were sent out to manage—to first and foremost break apart me and Charlie and then to manage us. And I'll speak more about that this week, but I spoke to my husband about it, and I see it so clearly now what happened— and those messages between me and Charlie leading up to that week that he tweeted us. It was actually Scott Adams, who did a video that I'll never forget when that happened. And he said like it ripped a hole in the universe—this tweet—and it was never supposed to happen. I'm going to dig that up, find it, and speak more about what my experience was—where I do genuinely believe that handlers were sent out. And I got lucky that I had this overwhelming spiritual feeling that needed to go to the UK, and I met my husband.
