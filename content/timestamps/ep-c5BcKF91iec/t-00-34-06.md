## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You would think he would have a shred of humility. You would think he would apologize for lying about Charlie's position on Israel, but he didn't. He just sort of doubled down. He sort of "Israeled" down, if you will. And it sort of gave me an idea for a little miniseries—a little recurring miniseries that we'll probably have on this show—an HBO miniseries, by the way, executively produced by me. I wanna show it to you guys now. It's a trailer that we put together. I sure hope you guys like it. Take a listen. How Charlie Kirk was actually feeling about the pressure he was receiving from pro-Israel Zionist donors to Turning Point USA.
