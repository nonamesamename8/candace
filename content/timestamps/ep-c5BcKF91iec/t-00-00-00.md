## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys. Happy Monday. I am back. I know you guys missed me because I definitely missed you more. And I feel so much better after getting out to the mountains. I've now, I think, officially accepted that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is not coming back. And somehow it took me longer to get there. It took me longer to accept that fact than it did many others. Some people accepted it within just a matter of days. His quote-unquote closest friends, his closest political allies, the White House—they all seemed kind of ready to move on so much faster than I was. And now it's looking like some people even may have accepted Charlie's death within minutes. There was a video that is currently circulating of his chief of staff, Mikey McCoy.
