## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So we decided to slow this clip down, and we're gonna watch this clip slowed down so you can see that it is exactly 834 milliseconds from the time that you hear the shot. That is how long it takes for Mikey McCoy to put the phone to his ear. Now why is that precise timing so important? Because there's no dialing. Mikey didn't have time to dial, okay? You can't dial and put your phone to your ear in 0.834 seconds. The next time that you're gonna see Mikey McCoy, as we just showed you, is in just under two and a half seconds on the other side of the tent. He's on a phone call.
