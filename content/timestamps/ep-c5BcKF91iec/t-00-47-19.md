The beauty industry kind of convinced us that we need complex formulas to achieve healthy skin, but the secret to healthy skin is actually a lot simpler. That's why I was very interested when I found Nimi Skin Care. Nimi is doing something radical.

Nimi has two products from their tallow line that you should definitely know about.
