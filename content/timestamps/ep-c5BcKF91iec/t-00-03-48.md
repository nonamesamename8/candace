## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's now been 47 days since my friend Charlie Kirk was executed in front of the world because that's what it was—a public execution. And call me crazy. Many people do. But I was so clearly deluded in the immediate aftermath of his death that I was operating under this delusion. I mean, I truly believed that I would be fighting for answers to what actually happened on 9/10, alongside Charlie's inner circle. I thought the band maybe was going to get back together. We were all going to maybe be on a group chat: me, Tyler Bowyer, Andrew Kolvet, Stacey Sheridan even.
