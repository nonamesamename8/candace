**SPEAKER_2:**
> As a father, I just—I wanna protect my son. And I thought, "I got a plan for you, son." He said, "Dad, that's not Charlie's plan." And you know what? I'm looking at my son who's 24 years old. Justin's the chief CFO—chief financial officer—and Mikey's the chief of staff. And I'm watching. The minute Charlie was shot, he called me. Says, "Dad, Charlie's been shot in the neck.
