## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He is now infamous for just being such a deceitful little creature. The text message exchange: Josh Hammer caught hand in the cookie jar. I'm talking way in the cookie jar. No other way to say it, right? Charlie gets killed. He, on the same day, starts pushing his book. Charlie's last words were, "Buy my book. Buy Josh Hammer's book." He had the night before—oh, he never even flinched on Israel. He loved Israel so much. And then I just waited because we're fishing now. And I knew they would do this. I knew liars have to lie fast and first. And he did. He lied. He lied over and over and over again about his position on Israel. And when he got caught, you would think that he would have a shred of decency.
