## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So here is where I was. I went to Wyoming to breathe, to hike, to listen to way too much Kanye West music. I absolutely love the mountains. I am a mountain person, so to speak.

I then visited Wyoming many times thereafter over the years. And the last time I went to Wyoming, I was with Charlie Kirk. He was the last person I visited with, and it was for, ironically, Foster Friess's funeral—who was a big-time donor to Turning Point USA, still is, I believe.
