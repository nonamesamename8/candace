## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I said to him, "Oh, I know what happens after. We all get to see Charlie Kirk die from a different angle. We've seen him die from a thousand different angles. Like, what is actually changing if Google hacks you?" Weird—a weird thing to say. I also asked him who he was on the phone with after Charlie got shot. And he told me—and I kid you not— he was on the phone with the ops that were back in Arizona watching. And I said, "What ops? We don't have people back in Arizona watching when we do college campus events. Is that something new?" He said, "Yes, it is new. In fact, this was the first time we were doing it." He said there were two people—two ops watching it back in Arizona.
