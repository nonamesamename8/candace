## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And so I want you guys to know another fun fact about Charlie Kirk. He hated fishing. He absolutely loved the mountains. He loved hiking. He was quite the athlete, but he hated fishing. It just was not his thing. And the same way that golf is just not my thing, fishing was not his. And this photo that I'm about to show you makes me laugh because we were in British Columbia fishing. And here's a photo of me and Charlie. And I was so excited about this catch. Charlie's eyes are closed here. And as soon as—I think it was Don Jr.— it might've been Corey Lewandowski—hit flash, took the picture. Charlie just went, "I don't know why you guys like this," because he was too hyperactive. He always wanted to be planning and doing a million things at once. And fishing—fishing takes time. You got to set the bait.
