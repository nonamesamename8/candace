## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Every minute of what he was doing before he took those cameras down. And there are only four minutes, by the way, before he takes those cameras down. So he's next to—and he is in front of—Mikey McCoy when Charlie gets shot. Now to his credit, he actually did see Charlie get shot. He saw—like a split second—sees Charlie bleeding and runs. And doesn't run very far. He just runs a couple of yards away. Now I should mention that the camera guy—he too was also brought into the company by Tyler Bowyer, okay? And if you have worked with Charlie for this long—over a decade— and you watch Charlie Kirk get shot, what do you do?
