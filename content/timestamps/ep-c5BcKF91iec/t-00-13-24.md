## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I can tell you that it is one minute and 45 seconds approximately before that shot goes off. And we can watch that here. I see Mikey's on his phone here. And you're gonna see he pulls it up, and he starts to cover his ear again. Now, could be unrelated. Again, we're taking a guess here. That's what made the most sense to us because we couldn't justify it in any other way. And I wanna be clear: we're not here to make assumptions, okay? And we wouldn't have to make any assumptions if Turning Point USA could just tell the truth. They could just be open, and they could be honest about everything.
