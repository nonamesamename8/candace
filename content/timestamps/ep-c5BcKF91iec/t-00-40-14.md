## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I don't know. I just felt like I needed to share that because it is in part why the moment that Charlie got shot, I just knew he was betrayed spiritually. In the same way that Charlie knew he was going to die young, I knew that this was a part of something bigger. And so I wanted to say to you guys—to the people that betrayed Charlie— I would recommend that you come clean, okay? I would recommend that you come clean because Charlie said some other things, and I look at these things now, and I think, "Wow, it's almost prophetic, right? It's almost prophecy." And I can tell you that this is a story that will have a happy ending—a tragedy that will have a happy ending.
