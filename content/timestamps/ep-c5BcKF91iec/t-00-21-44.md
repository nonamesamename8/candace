## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And he told me that the reason that they were doing it was because—you know, Candace (Candace Owens)—he said, "Charlie—he was so ambitious, and it wasn't fast enough that it was all being live-streamed. He wanted people to live-cut the clips so that they could be the first people to get it on the internet. He didn't want to—he's like, not even a second to be wasted. So live-streaming to everybody can watch, but they were racing some people to get the clips out faster than anybody else because Charlie's ambitious." Now I got a little suspicious, and sensing he could sense that I was now growing increasingly suspicious with every random thing that he was saying, he sent me a video I didn't ask for. I wanted to see the footage.
