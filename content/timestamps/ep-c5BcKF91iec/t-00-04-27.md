## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If you're wondering who Stacey Sheridan is, by the way, she's the one who's holding the camera when Charlie's casket is being escorted off of Air Force Two. She's like the chief money person, essentially, at Turning Point USA. She was brought in to reel in the big donors. I remember exactly when that happened. All of those people, by the way, were actually brought in by Tyler Bowyer. He's a very important character in this story, but we're gonna get into all of that tomorrow. The point that I'm making here is that I had assumed—clearly, wrongly—that we'd all maybe be on a group chat, communicating, raising hell, and demanding answers from the feds, from the police, from the White House, even. Certainly, at the very least, pointing out the very many holes in this story.
