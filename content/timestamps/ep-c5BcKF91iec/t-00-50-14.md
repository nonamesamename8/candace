## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Ireland Baldwin wrote, "The most disgusting, hateful, cancerous human being I've ever come across." And that's amazing considering Alec Baldwin is her father. Roseanne Barr wrote, "Monster. If I see this B-I-T-C-H, I'll knock her the F out." Keeping it classy. Eminem wrote, "Dirtbag in a skirt." I don't even feel like I wear that many skirts, so that's impressive. JoJo Siwa—that's my favorite one. "Candace and I do not F with each other." "I would have you on my show anytime. I always tell you that. And I love that you look like you're a lot happier than you were a few years ago." Ben Shapiro—notoriously on that table—said her faux sophistication has been ridiculous. So I'm keeping it faux sophisticated. And Chrissy Teigen wrote, "Go the F away already, you dumb soulless panderer."
