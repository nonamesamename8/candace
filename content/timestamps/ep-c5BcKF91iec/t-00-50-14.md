## Transcript

> Ireland Baldwin wrote, "The most disgusting, hateful, cancerous human being I've ever come across." And that's amazing considering Alec Baldwin is her father. Roseanne Barr wrote, "Monster.

JoJo Siwa—that's my favorite one. "Candace and I do not F with each other." "I would have you on my show anytime. I always tell you that. And I love that you look like you're a lot happier than you were a few years ago." Ben Shapiro—notoriously on that table—said her faux sophistication has been ridiculous.
