## Transcript

So it was the least traumatizing footage of all. Why be so secretive about it? He then told me that he needed to speak with Turning Point lawyers first to see about releasing the footage. I said, "Okay, fine." I let him take a couple of days off, and then we got back on the phone, and I said, "Look, that's kind of a BS excuse too because you run your own company, and the footage is owned by you." He then said, "Okay, yeah, I do own the footage. I just wanted—you know—just coordinate, check, whatever." Okay. Kind of a lie number two-ish. Then he said something that really bothered me.
