## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Thank you, Candace, for always sharing the truth. God bless you." Thank you, Amanda. Kiki Mack writes, "Candace, thank you so much for helping remove the wool from my eyes and bringing me back to church. Never stop fighting for truth. You are setting an amazing example for girls in the future. We love you, sister. Christ is King." Thank you so much, Kiki. And I do think women are a big part of this. I think we were kind of—and we get into this in this book—but the feminist movement? To know where that comes from. There's a chapter called "Beyond the Pale"—the Pale of Settlement of Russia who brought over that feminist movement. It is good for you to know where that came from because I think we all were doing feminism. I was when I was younger—like, "I'm a feminist," thinking it was like girl power, Spice Girls—and it was never that. Never ever that. Amal writes, "I hate to be morbid, but God truly saved you by removing you from DW. I'm so grateful that you're in a most fort by God Almighty."
