## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> 216 Western U.S. ranches. Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones or antibiotics. Every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to the Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures. When you purchase from Riverbend Ranch, you're not only supporting the 64 cowboys and their families who work on the ranch, but you're also supporting the over 260 other U.S. ranches and the hundreds of American families who work on those ranches. It's born in the USA, raised in the USA, and processed here in the USA. Their meat is aged to perfection for 21 days. And then it's shipped directly from their ranch to your home. This is not your average black Angus beef. This is more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef I've ever tasted.
