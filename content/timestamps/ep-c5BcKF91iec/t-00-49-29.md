## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So we don't know—no, but we know. We have that back up in stock. We just added that today. And finally, for those of you guys who pre-ordered the book, Make Him a Sandwich is out. Why real women don't need fake feminism. It is so amazing to hold this book. Also, I want to tell you—they said, "You know, you're supposed to go out when you do a book and ask people to write something nice about you—like, 'Yeah, this is amazing, and I love her,' da-da-da-da—Ian Carroll or something." And I just thought it would be so much more fun to go on the internet and to look at all the comments that have been said by famous people about me. So we've got Cardi B, who wrote a review. She said, "I honestly feel sorry for you." This is a review of my character over the years. "Candace Owens is a fraud"—from Lance Bass.
