## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We don't know—no, but we know—has become my favorite phrase. Look: Charlie didn't know—no, but he knew—that he was gonna die young from the moment that he started Turning Point, as he said. But he knew. And he was right. So go with your gut. Believe in your dreams, right? And when people try to mock you and tell you not to listen to them—not to trust your gut—know that those people are working for the devil, literally, okay? They want you to think that this life is it, and this life is not it. So get right with God and tell the truth, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
