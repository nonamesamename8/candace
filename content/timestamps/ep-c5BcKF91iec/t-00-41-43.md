## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's why I've chosen to be on the side of goodness and truth, no matter what the cost is. I've picked my side. I don't care about any of you. I can't wait to read your articles after this. Okay. That's breakfast for me. That inspires me now. Can't wait to read your loony tweets. I can't wait for you to live off things that I've said. I cannot wait because you know what? On a hike that Charlie and I were on in Wyoming one time, we were discussing the death penalty. Like, he was asking—like, "What's your position on the death penalty?" And I told him, I've always been against it. And typically that's a theological conversation. Christians go back and forth on it: Do you have a right to take a life? I'm on the side that no, we don't have a right to take a life.
