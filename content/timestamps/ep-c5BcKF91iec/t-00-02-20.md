## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Charlie, I was thinking out there—remembering [he] paid for my flight to Wyoming. I had to get there very quickly because I was doing Joe Rogan's podcast, which was huge. I didn't even know what the Joe Rogan podcast was at that moment. That's how I was so not politically inclined at all. And he's like, "This is the biggest podcast. You got to do this." I completely bombed it, by the way. I was so nervous. I think I said "um" like 3000 times. But then I had to very quickly get over to Wyoming because Kanye had invited me to his album release party. And again, ironically, where he held that album release party would be where years later Foster Friess would have his funeral. And so Wyoming felt fitting. I fished while I was out there.
