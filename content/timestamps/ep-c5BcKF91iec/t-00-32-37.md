## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's so obvious what's coming down the pipeline that they think, "Oh, it's not appropriate to share private messages unless we do it. Unless we do it.

And I think it was actually Pastor McCoy's speech: "Charlie wanted me to lead the next movement. Charlie told me, 'I'm America's pastor,' he said." Yeah, I'm sure he did. I'm sure he did. I'm sure he called you America's pastor. And so, yeah, I will be doing whatever I want to do until the truth is told about what happened on 9/10. We should start with Josh Hammer, by the way, because he really has now become the king of defying no stereotypes— where we last left off, obviously.
