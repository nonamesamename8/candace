## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And the thing that struck me as wrong was that he lied to me. I don't know why he was lying to me, but a lot of the things that he said didn't make sense. And I'm gonna speak more thoroughly about what it was that he said because, obviously, I recorded the phone call. I, of course, asked him why he took down the cameras so quickly. I asked him to, first and foremost, simply show me the footage because that's all I wanted to do. I'm thinking again, we're all going to get the band back together and solve this murder. And it got weird. It got really weird. I said, "I just want to see the footage so I can debunk. I know that you don't want to put more footage out there. That's fine. But just show me the footage so I can debunk all these internet conspiracies that you were hiding something."
