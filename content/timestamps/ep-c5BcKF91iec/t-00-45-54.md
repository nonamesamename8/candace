## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I simply open the kit, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and get back to life. This kit is literally a lifesaver with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So go to twc.health/Candace today and use code Candace at checkout, and you'll save $48. Get it now before cold and flu season kicks into high gear. That's twc.health/Candace. Use code CANDACE, and you'll get $48 off. Kits available to U.S. residents only. Also, I want to remind you guys about American Financing because the cost of everything is still out of control. Many of us are relying on credit cards to cover the essentials. If that debt is piling up for you, you should know that you're obviously not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt.
