## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like, you can ask Comet to type, to click, to search, to scroll. It can even help you plan your weeknight dinners. It can—in just a couple of taps—get a personalized meal plan for you based on your family's preferences. Comet orders the groceries for me, and it gets them delivered right to my door. Comet can shop for you, make reservations, book travel, summarize articles or videos, send emails, schedule meetings, and a lot more to make your life easier. So go and take back your time online. Download Perplexity's new web browser called Comet, and let it work for you—not the other way around. Check it out at pplx.ai/Candace. That's pplx.ai/Candace. And you guys already know the biggest health secret that's not being talked about is that everything begins in your gut.
