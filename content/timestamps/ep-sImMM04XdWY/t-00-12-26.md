## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then I was upset about the phone call because I was pregnant, and then I felt bad, and I was like, "Okay, let me think about it," because I don't want people in Russia to be killed because I won't stop speaking about Brigitte if the Ukraine peace deal is actually at the center of this. And he says, "Okay." And then I tried to say, "I will circle back tomorrow," or maybe I said "tonight." "Call if you want to chat at all." And we did; we chatted. The next day, you can see he starts with, "The White House just asked for your number, FYI. I think POTUS might call you." And that's not what happened. On February 25th, actually, Sergio Gor called me and asked me to stop speaking about Brigitte. And it felt more like an order than a request. And I did not respond in kind to that. February 26th. President Donald Trump calls me and asks me to stop speaking about Brigitte. Now, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s in the middle of this.
