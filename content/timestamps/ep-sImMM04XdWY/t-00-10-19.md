## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So what was up with the cease-and-desist? I think my suspicion is they knew that I was moving to interview Xavier Poussard, which I then did. As you can see on the timeline, on December 21st, I interview Xavier Poussard in London. We did not release it, right? We fast forward; we receive after he forwards it to our actual attorney and we receive the communication. And it actually just makes me angry because I'm pregnant. Now we're in 2025, and I decide that actually I'm going to turn this into an entire season because who are you, French first man, to tell us that we can't speak about the story, which is incredibly interesting?
