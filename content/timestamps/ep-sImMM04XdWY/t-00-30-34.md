## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Just $28 will help her to see the life that's growing inside of her, and it will provide her with truth that our culture does not. So don't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. You can be clear, and you can be unapologetically pro-life. You can give $28. You can give 10 times that if you want. This is the line that we have to stand on. We have to stand for truth and what is right and save lives from abortion, standing firm in the gospel. preborn.org/candace to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also, I want to tell you guys about Beekeeper's Naturals because this holiday season may be full of joy, travel, and togetherness, but it also happens to overlap with peak cold and flu season between crowded stores, packed schedules, late nights, and extra stress. Our immune systems are working overtime just when we need them the most. That's why I'm so thankful for Beekeeper's Naturals and their amazing Propolis Throat Spray. If you haven't heard of propolis, it's this natural immune-supporting substance that bees make to protect their hives.
