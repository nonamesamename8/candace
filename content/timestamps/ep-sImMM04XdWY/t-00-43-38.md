## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> What is going on? How dare they call anything that we are covering a conspiracy theory? The conspiracy theory—I'll tell you what it is right now. I don't want you guys to be conspiracy theorists. The conspiracy theory is that Tyler Robinson, who did not attend UVU, had never been on UVU campus, packed up his car that day, jumped onto a rooftop, figured out how to like jump around like Spider-Man and just knew exactly where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would be seated—despite having never been there—took a shot—one shot with .30-06 that got stopped because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) eats spinach. And then he swallowed it actually because it actually ricocheted down into his stomach. He then makes a hasty retreat into a Dairy Queen where he texts every minute of what he did to his lover. And then despite going home to his lover— he decides the next day to still text his lover more about his dad. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, he's home, but they're still texting more because—like—that's what you should do as opposed to just talking to him face-to-face. And he wanted to get away with it. And he expresses that.
