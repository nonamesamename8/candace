## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> BTT leaves from Paris, and it's go time, right? This plane is now going to stay for six days, and then it's gonna go to Wilmington, Delaware. As you guys know, it's gonna stay in Wilmington, Delaware, before departing on September 11th after Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. I find this now to be very interesting, okay? Very interesting as to whether or not on that Egyptian—quote-unquote "Egyptian"—plane, there could have been foreigners that are not from Egypt. And I think that's pretty obvious that these people were not from Egypt, okay? I really don't think this was an Egyptian-filled plane, whether or not they had Egyptian passports or Egyptian names is a whole other story, but people at the state level print IDs, right?
