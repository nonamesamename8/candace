## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You can head to beekeepersnaturals.com/candace or enter code Candace, and you'll get 30% off site-wide. This is their biggest sale of the year. Their best sellers always sell out once the Black Friday sale opens to the public. So take advantage of my code and shop the sale early.

I gotta tell you guys, by the time we're done with this list of verifiable Turning Point lies, it's gonna look like a CVS receipt. You know what I mean? It's just getting longer and longer, and these misrepresentations are, of course, lies. So Brian Harpole obviously sat down with Sean Ryan, and he tried to explain how things went wrong and how it wasn't fair and woe is them—millions of dollars that we received—but this is actually the fault of UVU police, right? It's actually the fault of this Chief Long. I had a lead on this for a few weeks from within Turning Point USA.
