## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. I know that I say that every episode is going to be explosive, but the lies and the intentional misrepresentations that are being delivered by Turning Point USA and their affiliates are really reaching a fever pitch because we can confirm that Brian Harpole lied badly to Sean Ryan in an interview that one of the heads of security gave the other day. And I'm going to explain to you how we know that. I'm starting to think that we should believe that nothing they've told us is real. Plus, I don't think we can reasonably ignore that odd French company in Delaware.
