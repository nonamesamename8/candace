## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) offers to take Turning Point to the next level financially. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) declines that offer, okay? Fast forward to the 17th; BBT flies again. It does its Nebraska route. Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s speaking on August 23rd. It again goes through to Wilmington, and it stays one night on August 23rd in Wilmington before heading back to Cairo. On September 3rd, Brigitte Macron is basically opening up Paris Design Week, and she's photographed with the Minister of Culture. We have that, and then drops off. On the 4th, we have the BTT flight departing from Paris. Now, I'm going to tell you what's really interesting about that September 3rd date that I forgot to mention before we get to September 4th. President Zelensky is in town also, though.
