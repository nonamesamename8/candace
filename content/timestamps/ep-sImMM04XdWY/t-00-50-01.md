**Candace Owens:**
> Adrave writes: "Thank you for not giving up and showing no mercy to the elite. We support you." Thank you guys. Ms. Mint Julips writes: "You plus your unseen squad equals fire, and you are appreciated. The FBI has no integrity. That's why they never tried to recruit you. If I had a niece like you, I'd be crazy proud." Thank you so much for saying that. And no, I've never been recruited by the government. And I feel really dumb for thinking that things could be resolved in government. Like I said, if there is any silver lining in the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination, it's that I think it taught all of us a lesson about our faith that we could somehow fix it in this system. All of it's happening at once. The Epstein files, the sort of collapse of Hollywood, the stories that we are learning and watching the elites protect Jeffrey Epstein—his victims speaking out and saying presidents—Republican and Democrat—and all of them worked to cover this—lets us know that we gotta stop pointing fingers at one another. Elizabeth Jones writes: "Do you think Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination could be a message to Trump or Kash to stay in line?"
