## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now they are violating the illusion and just hoping that money is going to fix this. Money's not gonna fix this, okay? Killing people more is actually only going to catalyze the understanding that we're all having that there was something very dangerous and something deep and dark that is going on. And the themes that were in this Brigitte story are now in this Charlie (Charlie Kirk) story. So many people involved here having a history of child sex abuse. It's just not normal. How many times does this come up in the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) story? Whether you're talking about George Zinn or the person that jumped up and screamed or the pastors, the Calvary Chapel that for whatever reason kept getting into these scandals that we went over the other day.
