## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Anyways, we'll be right back and respond to some of your questions and comments. Now, in all the time that I've been endorsing my wireless company, PureTalk, I have never seen an offer like this. Never. Right now, you can get unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited data with a 30-gig hotspot for just $29.95 a month for life. This is PureTalk's top-tier plan, which is normally $65 a month, and right now through December 7th, you can get all of that for just $29.95 a month. You're saving over 50% a month every month for life, and it's all on their crazy-fast 5G network. This offer is extremely short-lived, of course, so do not wait. Go to puretalk.com/owens for PureTalk's best unlimited plan for just $29.95 a month for life. Make the switch in as little as 10 minutes. You can keep your phone, keep your number, and you can start saving with their unlimited-for-life plan. Again, that's puretalk.com/owens to switch to my wireless company, which is PureTalk. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing because the Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that is good news for American homeowners. If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than right now to get your finances in order.
