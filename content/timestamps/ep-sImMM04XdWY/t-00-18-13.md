## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> By the way, I'm gonna show you this. So odd—like we were so surprised when we got this. Yeah, they depart on the 26th from Wilmington heading back to Cairo. They released it in that period of time that they're suing me. On July 27th, I'm showing you this private communication between my legal team. We were very confused about why this lawsuit was being filed in Delaware. Not putting anything together. Obviously, I didn't know about Satis. Nothing. This is my lawyer, and he says, "Here's the PDF. It's massive." We're likely going to try to file a motion to dismiss to stay the case on the grounds that it's inconvenient to litigate in Delaware because you're in Tennessee. Your companies in Delaware do not defame anyone. The witnesses are in Tennessee. The Macrons are not citizens of Delaware. Thus, there's no connection to Delaware.
