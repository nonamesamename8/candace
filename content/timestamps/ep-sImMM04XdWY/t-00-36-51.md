## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He should have said, "This text message happened between Dan Flood and Jeff Long," and here's what it was pertaining to—or he should have showed more, but he couldn't show more. And, you know, Sean Ryan got played. He did. And he should be upset that he got played because they're basically using him to, uh, just propagandize the situation and pretend that they're somehow the victims. Something else that is very strange that I was told early on when all of these leaks were coming is that not only did Turning Point not walk the campus when they got there—I'm referring to the security—but also the only thing that Dan Flood apparently cared about was making sure that their SUVs had clear access behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—in and out access. So they were not concerned about any other rooftops. They were not concerned about walking to make sure that they had access to other rooftops—obviously—or to make sure that they could see what points it was that the people could just walk onto the courtyard. They weren't concerned about any of that. All they cared about, for whatever reason, was the Hall of Flags—controlled access in the Hall of Flags. And I'm wondering if that reason is because— this is really interesting. But I told you—it's kind of strange that there were only two videos of people really that saw the alleged shooter on the roof that sprinted off of Lozier. I found that to be quite strange.
