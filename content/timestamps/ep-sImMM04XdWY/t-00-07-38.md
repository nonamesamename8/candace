## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So we're gonna bring that up here because I like timelines. It makes things neat, right? So we are in 2024, right? March 13th, I do that first episode regarding Brigitte Macron. March 19th, just six days later, I'm fired from the Daily Wire. I thought it was 10; it's actually six days later I get fired from the Daily Wire. Then, in mid-November, I began communicating with Xavier Poussard regarding the potential to interview him during an upcoming trip to London. Xavier Poussard is the person who wrote the "Becoming Brigitte" book. He has never been sued for defamation, and I was only going to interview him one time because he had never been on camera.
