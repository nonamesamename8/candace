## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That was in March of 2024. It was on March 13th, 2024, that I did the very first ever episode on Brigitte Macron, right? And then wham, I am fired within 10 days. It's a pretty quick turnaround. Charlie (Charlie Kirk), of course, was a staunch defender of mine immediately when I got fired, publicly and privately. He had my back, and then suddenly donors start to squeeze him and tell him that I can no longer hit the stage at Turning Point's Amfest. They want me gone from the Turning Point roster. I bring my new independent show back in June, and the timeline—actually, when I start to put these things together—is interesting.
