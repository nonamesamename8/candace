## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Of course, you have to ask questions to pursue truth. To get to the truth, you cannot just accept blanket narratives from people who are not authorities—like, I mean, like—who are just deeming themselves authorities and saying, "Well, listen to me." I guess we should just listen to Kash Patel because he's Kash Patel. That's ridiculous, obviously. If you choose to trust, you should also verify. And they are now trying to tell you that that process of verification is satanic, which couldn't be further from the truth. M. Poulice writes: "A gang of demented—" he's quoting me here— "A gang of demented psychopaths rule over us, and their solution to being caught doing psychopathic things is to murder us." I had to rewind that last episode. "Candace, your investigation is uncovering so much that would never see the light of day. Stay safe." Yeah. I think there was something about the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination that made a lot of us want to be brave because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was about as safe socks as it gets. You know, he really was. And they assassinated him anyways. So how can we feel safe?
