## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Like, what are we doing in Delaware? We should dismiss in Delaware and say that they have to file where you are—like where they claim that they have been defamed is here in Tennessee. That's so interesting to me in retrospect that we didn't understand why this was happening in Delaware. Anyways, moving on to August 1st—same week—Tucker (Tucker Carlson) releases an episode with me. And what goes viral from that episode is that we are discussing the Brigitte case. Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is interested; he's watched the series; he believes that Brigitte Macron was born a man—or born a male, rather—and that goes viral, okay? It just goes viral; gets more people speaking about it. So you can see a lot of stuff is happening at this time. Then what we have is in very early August; we know that that is when Turning Point is beginning to scout this location for their events. The school is telling them, "This is not a great place for you to host this because there's no traffic control here."
