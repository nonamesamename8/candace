## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I thought that would be a great get, and I still believe that Brigitte Macron was born a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux. Suddenly, on December 3rd, before I interview him, I receive the first ever cease-and-desist letter from Brigitte Macron and her lawyers. And the funny thing is I didn't receive it. They sent it to a really strange inbox that was not monitored, right? This is only—and this is on December 3rd—you can see, please see attached the time-sensitive legal correspondence sent on behalf of our clients, President Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron. We urge you to provide this correspondence to legal counsel promptly. They sent it to the Club Candace info.
