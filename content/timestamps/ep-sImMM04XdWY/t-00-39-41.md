## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Why isn't Dan Flood speaking? Has Dan Flood been fired from Turning Point USA? Was this actually just a propagandist mission to sit down with Sean Ryan and to lie and misrepresent? Everybody's instincts were correct about that interview. We are still being told lies by Turning Point. Now, beyond that, this is crazy. This broke in Utah. So, the story goes—and I told you that the story was BS—but what the feds told us was that, you know, grandpa's gun was missing, and then a friend called, and, you know, the dad—the dad—Tyler Robinson's dad recognized his own son, and then turned his son in. And I told you that was a lie. That's not how things went down. And I was called a liar, and no one believed that I had sources.
