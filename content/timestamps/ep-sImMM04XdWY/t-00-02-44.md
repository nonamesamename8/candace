## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I mean, I am talking maybe 72 hours max after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was killed, and he was also upset on the phone, but he said something, and it's hitting differently the more that I think about it. He said, and I quote, "Candace, it was supposed to be you." It was supposed to be you. Now at the time, I dismissed this as some sort of bargaining, right? That's an actual stage of grief. You do bargain. You wish that it was this person. You could trade it. Maybe you wish that it was yourself. And to be honest, I did go through that phase of bargaining with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Like, why didn't it happen to somebody else? This is a good person who had his whole life ahead of him. I mean, I told you that even my father went through that stage of grief.
