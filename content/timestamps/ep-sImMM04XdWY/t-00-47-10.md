## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> If you'd like to buy my new book "Make Him a Sandwich," you can head to MakeHimASandwich.com for our regularly priced books. And then we have signed copies that are also available on the CandaceOwens.com website. By the way, tomorrow book club will be at 6 p.m. Eastern because today is my son's birthday. And I did not calculate that when I said to bump it to Thursday. So it will be tomorrow, and we will continue reading "Sigmund Freud and the Jewish Mystical Tradition." Okay, top comment from yesterday. Angela wrote: "To all those working in government that still have morals and are willing to leak information involving corruption—God bless you. Thank you for helping us get justice and not tormenting us." Carl writes: "Candace, thanks for what you are doing to expose all this evil. What can we do besides watching your show, buying your book, etc.? Christ is king. Thanks." Well, take that to mean what it is, which is that truth will win; truth will prevail; truth is king. And I am telling you guys that it's not enough to just know the truth; you have to speak it. Speaking the truth—I just know that that is significant.
