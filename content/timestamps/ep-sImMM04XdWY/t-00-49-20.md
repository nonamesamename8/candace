## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> How can everybody at home feel safe if Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who always tried to make it work, was always everybody's friend, was somehow assassinated in broad daylight and his friends are lying about it? I don't know; that doesn't feel good. I don't feel safe at all. Certainly being quiet isn't gonna make anybody safe, which is why we have been sharing everything as a form of insurance. It's just the information that we have; we share across with so many other people, and we've empowered other people to know what's going on behind the scenes too. VBVC writes: "Just know that Ron Paul has used his platform to speak about it. His friend Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk—questioning the official narrative—and if dark forces are responsible, a 9/10/2025, no one is as loud as you, but Ron is a real one too." I think you mean 9/10. He don't know—no—but he has always known. Yeah, he's another person that I should probably get some stuff out to—send him another insurance package as I'm now terming it. So they know everything that's going on behind the scenes and threats that are being received because that's what it's going to take. We have to decentralize intelligence.
