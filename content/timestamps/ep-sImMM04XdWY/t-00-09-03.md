## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I was totally—a random box sent it to—so we didn't get it. We go back to our timeline. That's December 3rd. And seven days later is when it's announced that Satis—that's when it's publicly announced that Satis, that French company, has inked a deal in Wilmington, Delaware, for a hangar. Okay, there's suddenly a French company, and the CEO who knows Emmanuel Macron—we've confirmed that—decides they're gonna sign a two-year lease for an airport hangar to do what? To paint planes. I'm not kidding. Elsewhere in that article, it tells us that it's a French multinational company that specializes in the painting of aircraft, and they plan to open for business in a hangar not far from Wilmington Airport come the new year.
