## Transcript

**Tucker Carlson:**
> How did Bill Ackman get $9 billion? Bill Ackman—a pretty impressive guy? I know Bill Ackman. No. Bill Ackman's like well-connected and super-aggressive. That's it. And I think, you know, well-connected, super-aggressive people deserve a fair living like everybody else, but if you're accruing $9 billion just because you're willing to do anything? I don't know why we have to pretend that's good. How did Epstein get four Gulfstreams? How did he get an island, a massive ranch in New Mexico, the biggest house in New York? Like, what is that? Like, at some point, the basic economics really matter, and they matter because not that it's bad that rich people are getting richer—it's bad that everyone else is getting poorer. And it's especially bad the young people can't afford homes.
