## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So I feel like these questions I have now are quite valid. Andrew, by the way, was not the only person who called me on that day and reached out to my family on that day with this warning, immediately cautioning me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to keep our mouths shut, telling us that we should lay low because there was a quote-unquote "list" going around. Another person was a very well-known woman who happens to be married to a CIA contractor. Same exact message. "You and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson." But, of course, we cannot tell you who we are getting this information from. I'm starting to realize as I consider who the sources are and their closeness to the military. And now that we've gotten into the story and realize that virtually everybody there that day has these military ties, that that threat may have been coming from the government actually.
