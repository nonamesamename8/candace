## Transcript

**Brian Harpole:**
> On Monday before— this correspondence went to Chief Long. "Hello, Chief Long. We received this message today from the student group. There is a student roof access pretty close to where CK will be set up at the Utah Valley, the Sorensen Center. It has a couple of staircases that go up to walkways on the roofs." He comes back— for edification, the Sorensen Center was the building in front of the Locke Center— and so he comes back, and he says, "You want access to the roof?" And came back and said, "I was told students have access above us. If this is true, it would be nice to either have it controlled access or allow one of my guys to be there as well, if possible." He comes back, and his last correspondence was, "I got you covered." What else am I to do? When a command-level person from an accredited police department says, "I've got this area."
