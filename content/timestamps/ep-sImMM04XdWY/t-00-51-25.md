## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I think he's a part of the corruption, plain and simple. Black Fatigue writes: "Candace, and for those who are curious, go on Google and type in .30-06 damage, then click on the images, and now ask yourself if you think that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot with .30-06. Viewer discretion advised." Yeah, somebody who recently got shot accidentally by a .30-06 on a hunting trip sent me a photo to our tips box, and it was shocking. I mean, absolutely shocking. He described the damage that was done and just said, "In case you want to share with your viewers— in case they actually think that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s neck somehow stopped this." And I am declining to share that, but I think we can confirm that there was no miracle-bending bullet from the Lozier Center. A smaller weapon was used. Crazy Chris writes: "Love the comfort shirt. Feels like I'm chilling with my sister. Love you." Thank you so much. I did decide to go a little chill today. Renee writes: "I wonder if our president's plane ever landed there in Delaware, where we know that Biden was living in Delaware." He lives in Delaware. He's from Delaware. But I have—I do not think that Trump would have been described as a dignitary.
