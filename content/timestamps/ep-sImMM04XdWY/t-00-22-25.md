## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Of course, obviously, Jeffrey Epstein had a Saudi Arabian—totally different identification—multiple passports and different names. I am very curious about how that timeline is coming together because we were getting very close to something as we had started on September 8th, by the way, our "Becoming Brigitte" season two. And we were looking at how unusual it was that a dog was barking a bit too loud—you know, a thief that nobody was pursuing was running. And that was us discussing the MKUltra program and Brigitte Macron strangely and Emmanuel mentioning MKUltra in the lawsuit to us 18 times struck us as odd as we were trying to determine whether or not it could have been Brigitte Macron that was involved in that Stanford experiment—this prisoner 2093 that was being protected. We didn't know why this prisoner was being protected.
