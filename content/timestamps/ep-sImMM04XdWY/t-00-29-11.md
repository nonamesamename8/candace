## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We should see—we are receiving a bunch of tips about that company, and we are going to chase down those leads because it's very difficult—once I put that in a timeline for me—to simply ignore the France angle. Obviously, France would know. They should be able to just help us out. I'm sure they should be able to reach out to France and say, "Hey, you purchased this hangar." I mean, you decided to lease this hangar for two years—a very short time—to paint some planes. Could you tell us who landed in Wilmington, Delaware, and we're shuttled over to 920 King? I think that would be a good start. Anyways, we'll be right back, and I'll tell you about Brian Harpole's big lie when we come out of a few sponsors.
