## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> On September 17th, 2025, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby held a press conference. "Our job was not to interview; our job was just to get him here." After Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s alleged shooter was taken into custody in Washington County less than two days after the shooting— "Within the hour, my friend drove Tyler and his parents to my office where he was greeted by plainclothes detectives." After learning of this, I submitted a public records request to obtain any video of Tyler Robinson walking into the jail facility. Washington County responded saying there were no records responsive to the request as Robinson did not go to the jail area. A request for any holding room video was denied. A few weeks later, I re-upped the request on a more generalized scale for surveillance video showing Tyler Robinson walking into the sheriff's office.
