## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> We sent somebody there. There seemed to be more. And what really terrifies me is that if my inclination that Xavier Poussard's messages have been being read and tracked for longer than I even realized—and that's the reason they initially sent that cease-and-desist in December—was to ward me off sitting down with Xavier Poussard—then what we hadn't yet presented to the audience, but what we were investigating on the back end, if they were aware of that— it really makes me wonder if we were on the right track. And it was something that was so sinister, you know, involving maybe another step of the MKUltra program being used to foster serial killers and to give serial killers new identities and allowing them to run in countries. That was kind of conversations that I was having in the background with Xavier. And we thought that we had perhaps identified Brigitte Macron at Stanford University—a possibility is what I would say; we were maybe at 50-50%—and then suddenly Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk gets assassinated, and it totally throws us off of the scent entirely because we're trying to figure out what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk).
