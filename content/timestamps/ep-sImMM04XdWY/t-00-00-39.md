Because I know that many of you guys were wondering whether or not Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination was meant to distract us from the Brigitte Macron investigation. And rightfully so; that is a fair question. Because as you guys know, it was Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk that called me and told me that they wanted me to stop speaking about Brigitte.
