## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Communications are happening between me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) about Brigitte, okay? On July 1st—and by the way, the series is over, and I said I'll agree to be quiet about this for a while because it's no longer relevant, and I don't want Christian men to be slaughtered in Ukraine because I'm not keeping my mouth shut. Now, on July 1st, Macron sends another legal threat. On July 18th, this is where things get really interesting. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk hosts Tucker (Tucker Carlson) at Satis. This brings in the Tucker (Tucker Carlson) element, right? Tucker (Tucker Carlson), he tells Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to go max: call out Israel, Jeffrey Epstein, just go max. And guess what? Tucker (Tucker Carlson) really did go max.
