## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. We know that too many people are vilified for standing up for truth, but we also know that a lot of people are feeling tremendously courageous in these times. I'm certainly done playing defense. I don't water down what I believe to be palatable because silence is not kindness; it's consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds the topic of the lives that are lost before they even take their first breath. Now, if we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to always act like that. That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with real action. We can do this with truth, and we can do this with love. For just $28, you can give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion.
