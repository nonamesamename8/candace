## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Jumping back into this timeline. That's on the 17th; that—that email comes; that we premiere that sit-down interview with Xavier Poussard. A couple of days later, on February 24th, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) reaches out, and he tells me that the White House is asking me to stop speaking about Brigitte. And he tells me that it is related to the peace deal in Ukraine. That is ostensibly the reason. On the same day, February 24th—that's how quickly the phone call happened. This is the day that Donald Trump meets with Emmanuel Macron. Do we have that, by the way, the text message between me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Here we go. Yeah, this is February 24th. I'm showing you guys this now. "Hey, I have something to tell you from the White House. They asked me to call you. I'm just the messenger here, but it's important." I say, "Okay, I'm around. Call me." Then we have the phone call.
