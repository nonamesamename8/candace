## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And then people who have no talent are suddenly everywhere. Billboards. We're being told this is the most beautiful person, the smartest person; this person has what it takes to have a makeup brand—whatever it is—and they have no objective talent. That is not something that they would want messaged to Generation Z, Generation Coming Up, who's recognizing that something's not fair, that perhaps this whole idea that we live in a meritocracy is one big illusion. Anyways, back to our timeline, right? Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson says that, and we then have on July 18th that the request from Turning Point's UVU chapter—which we've not been able to independently verify, but that's what the local news said; that they saw it with their own eyes, but we didn't see it. That's when the request comes in for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to speak at UVU, very late in the day—never happens this way, okay? Like I told you, they are always working at least a semester behind on requests, but this one's happening quickly.
