## Transcript

**Megyn Kelly:**
> I found a video of me, Tucker (Tucker Carlson), and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) speaking backstage right before Tucker (Tucker Carlson) went out. Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and I were talking. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) came over and interrupted for just a second. And you can hear him on this tape, which I've listened to many times. It's very clear on my phone, less clear here—probably as he would play it. But he says to Tucker (Tucker Carlson), "Go max." He interrupts the conversation because he has to say to Tucker (Tucker Carlson) something. And what was so important to him to tell Tucker (Tucker Carlson) was, "Go, go max." Here it is. It's quick.
