## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The people who tried—with all of the money in the world—to artificially direct the markets toward them after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died are losing, okay? The people who sold T-shirts, who got on stage and said they were Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s favorite pastor, America's pastor—"I'm gonna take over for Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." People who use their connections, their wealth to get themselves almost invited to be a part of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s legacy—people that didn't even support Charlie (Charlie Kirk) while he was alive, the people who rushed to lie about me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s relationship as close as we were. You guys are losing. I want you to know that because the market turns out the market is smarter than you are. I go back to that Taylor Lorenz tweet early on.
