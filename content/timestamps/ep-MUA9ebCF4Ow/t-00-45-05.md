## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I want to know who killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and what's in the Epstein files. I think the same people are behind all of the greatest problems in the last 100 years. It's the source of all the corruption, wars, and even much of the division in our own country. Candace (Candace Owens) is absolutely doing the Lord's work, and I'm not even very religious." I could not agree more with you. It's actually the most important thing. That's why I said I'm not even voting until I know this because it is the undoing of everything. It's like we've just all just been veiled, and we just had not realized that we're now piercing through, and we're realizing that these monsters rule over us. Also, I see somebody in the live chat on YouTube wrote, "It looks like Mikey McCoy went to Oaks Christian in Thousand Oaks." That is correct. And the part that you're missing is that Rob McCoy ran that school. He ran Little Oaks. It's like a boarding school—Little Oaks.
