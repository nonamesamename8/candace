## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So this is not your average Black Angus beef. This is more flavorful and more tender than even the best Angus beef that I've ever tasted. Right now, when you head over to RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code Candace at checkout, you'll get $20 off your first order. Trust me, you're going to be so impressed. So visit RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code Candace at checkout. Also, I wanna tell you guys about Paleovalley because something that my team and I are always craving are their snack beef sticks—specifically the ones that Paleovalley makes using 100% grass-fed beef sourced from small-scale regenerative American farms, so you can feel good about what you're eating and what you're supporting. They've stripped out all the junk, so there are no preservatives. There's no gluten, soy, sugar, dairy, or GMOs. It's just clean, nutrient-dense fuel the way that food was intended to be.
