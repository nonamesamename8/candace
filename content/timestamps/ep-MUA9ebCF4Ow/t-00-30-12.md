## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Utah Valley Hospital is owned by IHC, and they run on a system called Epic—which many of you guys emailed me about. Look, I recognize the system. It's Epic. They had recently implemented Epic. They are not interlinked. These two hospitals do not speak to each other. If a patient has never been to Timpanogos Hospital but they have been to Utah Valley, their info would not come up at all in Timpanogos' system. So we don't know why that is. We don't know why this anomaly occurred where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had a file and when nurses were notified not to touch the file. We can't make sense of that. It's very strange. We're gonna move on from that. I just wanted to follow up and tell you that. If you know something, obviously email us.
