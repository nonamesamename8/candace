## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys. Happy Wednesday. I don't know what these people thought. I don't know what they thought. I think they thought Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would get assassinated. They would very quickly bury him in a yarmulke and then convince the world that he was actually besties with Ben Shapiro and Josh Hammer. He didn't even know Candace (Candace Owens). His last words before he died were, "Honor the Sabbath and buy Josh Hammer's book." Yeah. And also, he had just written this Romeo and Juliet letter to Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi). I feel like that was kind of the plan, but look, the best laid plans—they can fall apart. And I can tell you guys, this one is falling apart.
