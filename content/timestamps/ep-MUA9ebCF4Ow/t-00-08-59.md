## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Video that she shared was incredibly interesting because you will recall that after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, there was basically just me, Tucker (Tucker Carlson), and Megyn (Megyn Kelly) that were trying to say, "Hey, something was going on, and he was feeling a lot of peer pressure in the weeks leading up to his death." And Zionists were claiming that's all a lie. And Tucker (Tucker Carlson) was like, "No, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) asked me explicitly in July to go on stage and to go after Israel, trying to drag us into the Iran war." And I was talking to him about Jeffrey Epstein, and I was saying to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), "I won't do it." And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wanted me to do it, right? And the Zionists said that he was lying.
