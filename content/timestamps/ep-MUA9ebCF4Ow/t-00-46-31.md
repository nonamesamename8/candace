## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anyway, and like I said, I want to know who went to school with Mikey and the Erickson brothers. Other comments we have: Angie—"We need Go Max merch. Team Candace for life." Honestly, that's actually a great idea. Because we are going max now. We are going max. I love that. I love that he said "Go max." It's such a Charlie (Charlie Kirk) thing to say. Brittany Watson writes, "The Charlie (Charlie Kirk) betrayal and assassination is shaping up to be the scandal of our lifetime. And you are leading the charge of investigating and in question-asking. The world will owe you a debt of gratitude soon and very soon." Thanks for all. I totally agree that this is a scandal of our lifetime. And they're just trying to gaslight us to pretend like their behavior is normal—using every emotionally manipulative tactic to make us not look further.
