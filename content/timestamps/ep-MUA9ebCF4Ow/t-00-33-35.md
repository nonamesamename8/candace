## Transcript

**SPEAKER_7:**
> So we get there. We pray. We get out of the car. There's a whole bunch of TPUSA leaders there that wanna pose for pictures. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) graciously poses for pictures. He posed for a picture with me, and we'll show this picture here. This is me, Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and in the middle is Butch Hibbs. That's the brother of Jack Hibbs—Pastor Jack Hibbs. And he came to the event, wanted to meet us both, so we took a picture. This picture was taken maybe 20 minutes before the assassin struck.
