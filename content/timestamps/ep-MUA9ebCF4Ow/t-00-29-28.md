## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> It may appear open-ended, but I'm tracking down everything on the side. I am very organized in the background here. And it was regarding why Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had a medical file at Utah Valley Hospital despite the fact that he went to Timpanogos, right? I think you guys have emailed me and said that I'm pronouncing that wrong. I'm just gonna rock with Timpanogos. Now, we had wondered if perhaps the two hospitals shared information because that's a plausibility if you're using the same tech or maybe you're within the same healthcare system. We can now confirm that those two hospitals do not. They do not share information. Timpanogos Hospital is owned by HCA, which uses a charting system called VDI.

## Claims Made

- [factual] Timpanogos Hospital (HCA, VDI system) and Utah Valley Hospital (IHC, Epic system) do not share patient information
  - *Follow-up:* Hospital ownership and EHR system records
