## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, it's an inside joke. I'm in on it. Don't be dumb rights: "Israel isn't even our ally. No treaty to help if attacked. Didn't spot one IDF soldier during my time in Iraq or Afghanistan. Yeah, they don't have enough bodies. They need us. So they play psychological games with us so that we convince our sons to go die for them. They get land. They get free insurance.

If you're white, you're told it's your fault—it's your problem. If you're Black, you're told basically that you should be aspiring towards ebonics and hip-hop culture, and pretty much you're set up on the pipeline to prison pretty young. And both sides are told—Black and white people are told—you're not allowed to say anything bad about Israel or ruin your life.
