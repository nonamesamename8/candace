## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This is when I get in trouble whenever we're in the OT. I gotta stop, okay? It's nice. Just to say our show—Some Good News—is now available in Spanish, Portuguese, and French. So we have the links to those specific channels below. If you would prefer to hear me speak in French, in Spanish, and Portuguese, AI tools now allow us to do that to reach more people. If you guys would like to support us and the show, you will love my new book. Go to MakeHimASandwich.com. Holidays are around the corner. You can get that. We are also selling signed copies, so you can get that. I can't think of anything else. Obviously, you can support the show by just going to candaceowens.com and buying some of our gear—our Standards cup. This one has been a hot seller. And beyond that, I saw some of you guys asking about the Egyptian planes.
