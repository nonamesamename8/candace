## Transcript

**Joshua:**
> My name is Joshua. My question is: during a recent stop, you had Ben Shapiro as a guest, and he had made some claims about Candace (Candace Owens) saying that she had said certain things online. And when he made those claims, you looked visibly uncomfortable because you know you hadn't heard that and couldn't verify that. So my question is: why did you look so uncomfortable in that moment? And have you researched the claims that he made since? Thank you for that.
