## Transcript

**SPEAKER_3:**
> Yeah, no. He said that Candace (Candace Owens) has been claiming Erika Kirk was behind the murder of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), which I had not heard. And I was taken aback because that seems like something I would have heard. It's so crazy. And I have since learned it is not true. Candace (Candace Owens) has not made that claim. And in fact, I've now seen several clips of Candace (Candace Owens) specifically defending Erika Kirk and saying she would never make a claim like that about Erika and that she is open-minded to other people at Turning Point. That's obvious. She's been making that point. I had heard that point. But she's specifically been defending Erika Kirk. And she's been saying she does not think that of Erika. And in fact, if you read her comments, she's under pressure to make comments about Erika. And so far, what I've seen, she hasn't.
