## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

People just being insulting. I wake up. I'm called the N-word. Big deal. The internet is optional, Alexis Wilkins. It's optional, Kash Patel. This lawsuit is pathetic. You should be forced to step aside, but you know, it's probably not going to happen because a lot of things that are going on in this administration have been embarrassing.
