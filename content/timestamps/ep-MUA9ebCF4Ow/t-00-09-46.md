## Transcript

**Tucker Carlson:**
> Before that speech that I gave in July, we had a conversation about this backstage right before I went on. And I was fulminating and getting all red in the face—like I often do, to my shame—and I was mad thinking about this and thinking about the effort by the neocons in the United States to draw us into another forever war with Iran. Not a defense of Iran, of course. It's merely an acknowledgement that we've done this before. This happened in Iraq, which we entered into at the behest of those same foreign policy strategists, and it didn't work.
