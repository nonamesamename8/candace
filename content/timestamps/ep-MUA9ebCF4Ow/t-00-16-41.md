## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's a lie. Rob McCoy told that lie. Number six is Terrell, the AV guy, was told to remove the cameras by police. That's not true. I have every second of his moves. That offender would be Tyler Bowyer, okay? He lied. Number seven: Terrell moved the SD cards because people were stealing hats. Question mark. Andrew Kolvet: "What if you were scared about people stealing? Maybe remove the cameras? Very expensive cameras would be the thing that they would steal." What are they gonna do with your SD card? They're gonna resell that? Like, that doesn't make sense. Those are pretty cheap, right? Lie number eight: Ben Shapiro and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never had any bad blood between them.
