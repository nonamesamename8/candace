## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Butch Sr. was in the Navy. What he did in the Navy is unclear, but I'm interested. I'm just really interested. Also, something that I'm just gonna say on the side here is too many people that are involved in this Utah story I met through PragerU. Like, Jack Hibbs was somebody that Marissa flagged for me that she wanted me to have on my show. Like, she'd say like certain guests. The guy who runs—or did run—Operation Underground before he got into a scandal also was introduced to me by Marissa Strait. It's just—there's a lot that in the back of my mind I'm going, "This is interesting."
