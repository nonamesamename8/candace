Lie number three is that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s neck stopped a .30-06 bullet because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ate salad. He had strong bones. It was a modern-day Christian miracle. That's a lie. The offender is Andrew Colvett. Another lie: Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never blinked in his support for Israel.
