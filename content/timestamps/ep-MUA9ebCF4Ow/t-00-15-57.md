## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That's a lie, told by Pastor Rob McCoy. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a committed evangelical who only liked Catholic architecture. That's a lie, told and reinforced by Alex Clark and Andrew Kolvet. Lie number three is that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s neck stopped a .30-06 bullet because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ate salad. He had strong bones. It was a modern-day Christian miracle. That's a lie. The offender is Andrew Kolvet. Another lie: Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never blinked in his support for Israel. Offender: Josh Hammer, Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi), insert Zionist here—many Zionists, Christian Zionist influencers as well. That turned out to be a big lie, an unnecessary lie. Lie number five: the magnificent Mikey McCoy called his dad first.
