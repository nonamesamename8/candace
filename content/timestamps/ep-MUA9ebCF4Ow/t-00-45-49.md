## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I found that out. I guess Rob McCoy—he's actually even more amazing. He's had so many hats. Calvary Chapel outright purchased—for whatever reason—outright purchased the Christian Academy in 2009, I believe it was. I saw an article about it because the teachers were suing Rob because he fired them, and then Rob was suing them saying, "Well, I fired you because you weren't Christian enough and he didn't come to church on Sundays." It was this whole thing. And he filed in federal court, and the lawsuit didn't go through. I mean, he didn't win the lawsuit. I don't know who won the lawsuit. I didn't really get that far into it. But yeah, I'm interested in his interest in this Christian school.
