## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Yeah, like I said, they tried to bury Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in a yarmulke, and we were telling you no—he had a change of heart towards the end. And I was telling you that Turning Point had captured that. They were all miked. Okay, so Turning Point captured that, and they could have easily released it to give me a little bit of backup. But of course, that wasn't going to come from them. Well, just my luck and Tucker's (Tucker Carlson) luck that Megyn (Megyn Kelly) actually caught very quickly. Maybe it looks like maybe her assistant's backstage. I don't know the backstory here, but she was in that discussion, which I had not heard before. And she reveals very quickly—you were going to hear Charlie (Charlie Kirk) say that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) should go for it. So this is what Megyn (Megyn Kelly) released on her show yesterday. And you should go watch the full episode. Take a listen.
