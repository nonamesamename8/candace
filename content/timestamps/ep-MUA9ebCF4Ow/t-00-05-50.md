> And I'll tell you right now, Megyn (Megyn Kelly) was not done. And I will say this: even if I remove myself from a situation, it is actually the most disrespectful thing that you can do to someone that you purport to be friends with or friendly with.

And then this person starts coming after me and questioning my moral compass. Really process that. That's just not—that's just not cool beyond anything else. So I was pretty dumbfounded when Dave Rubin weighed in on the matter, and he called what Ben did—effectively trying to humiliate Megyn (Megyn Kelly) on her own stage— he referred to it as almost an act of bravery.
