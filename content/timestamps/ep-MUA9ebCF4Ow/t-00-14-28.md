## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

Why did she tweet that? Well, I have an answer for that now, Taylor—now that I'm seeing straight—because it's becoming very clear to me that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a product to everybody else. He was not a human being. He was a product that they felt that they had manufactured. That is my honest opinion, and I am entitled to that opinion, okay? And not only do they think that they had manufactured him, they felt that he was now malfunctioning. He was malfunctioning. And we're not gonna let this go.
