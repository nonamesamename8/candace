## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like, "Oh, what about these people? They're hurting. They're grieving." Keep the same effing energy you had when you were like, "Let's move on. Let's raise money." Stop acting like you were so aggrieved. If you can just move on and say, "I'm going to be the new person. I'm going to do speeches. I'm going to carry on"—and I'm speaking obviously here about Rob McCoy and Mikey McCoy—then you don't get to flip and go, "These people are too aggrieved." It doesn't work for me, okay? It doesn't work for me. I feel like Taylor Lorenz—like, once I came back from Wyoming, I then started paying attention to everyone's behavior, and I was like, "Why would I feel like I was the only one grieving? Like, what's up with the Turning Point employees, hey?" And by the way, obviously when I say like everyone at Turning Point, I clearly do not mean every single person at Turning Point because all of these leaks are coming from people that are at Turning Point.
