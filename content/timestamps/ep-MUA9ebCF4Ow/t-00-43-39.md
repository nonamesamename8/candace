## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Choose a wireless company that shares your values. And with Pure Talk—talk, text, and plenty of 5G data for just $25 a month—you could also be saving a lot of money. Head to puretalk.com/owens to make the switch today. Again, that's puretalk.com/owens and switch to America's wireless company, Pure Talk. Also, I want to tell you guys about American Financing because the Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that's great news for American homeowners. If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything feels so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. With rates dropping, now is the time to pay off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They're saving people just like you an average of $800 a month.
