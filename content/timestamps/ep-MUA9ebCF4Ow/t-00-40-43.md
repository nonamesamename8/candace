## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Other than people saying she works for Marissa Strait, PragerU—who, you know, she's formerly of the IDF Intelligence Unit. I worked for PragerU. I'm not a Mossad honeypot person, so that's not evidence. But there is evidence that she comes from a Freemason family in California. Like, dad was in the Freemason California Freemasons, and grandpa was pretty high up in the California Freemasons. And you know, Kash Patel drops in 33rd—hours like it means something. That's actually more interesting than the Mossad honeypot thing. Mom works in aerospace. We're not like—she's not just like some cutesy country singer that has no connections. Like, let's make that clear. She's not. She doesn't have no connections. Letting you guys know that.
