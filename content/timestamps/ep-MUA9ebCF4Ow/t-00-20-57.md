## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Turning Point insisted on having the event outside despite UVU saying they did not—they communicated to them—they did not think the outside was the best idea because of safety reasons. So my question now is: which specific Turning Point employees went down and picked that venue outside? I want to know. In fact, I need to know, and I will know, right? We're just—if you know, send me a tip—but we're gonna find out, okay? What's the events department looking like that does that? I know, by the way, that Mikey McCoy's wife is one of the events directors. Now, I'm not saying that she does campus events because there's different departments. She might do the bigger events. But was she at all involved in planning this event? I want to know. She may not have been. I need to know, and I will know.
