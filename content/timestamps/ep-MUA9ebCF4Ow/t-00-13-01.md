## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Because Tucker (Tucker Carlson) told the truth. He had a conversation with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) about everything, and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wanted him to go hard. Now Megyn (Megyn Kelly)'s adding to it. He even interrupted right before he hit the stage and said, "Go max, go max." Because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was done with these donors. He was done with them. He really was. And I can tell you another story about which donor was waiting for him once Tucker (Tucker Carlson) got off stage and yelled at Charlie (Charlie Kirk). That was a female Jewish donor. And I will be outing her later because I don't care about anything right now. Anyways, point being is we were telling the truth, and we have been facing so much peer pressure, so much nastiness for just trying to get out the true narrative about where Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s headspace was at before he died. And my favorite part of all of this now is watching them lose.
