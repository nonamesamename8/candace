## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Something else that I want to say—because somebody may have more information that will make it easier for me—is that we randomly received a tip from somebody who knew Pastor Rob McCoy from Thousand Oaks, California. And they were speaking about just kind of the area and how tight-knit it is in the church. And they said one of the things that's really weird is some of us have been speaking, and we had never heard of a Mikey McCoy—like his son, Mikey McCoy. So I followed that tip pretty lightly. This is by no means like a deep search, but somebody on the inside of Turning Point told me that Mikey—or Michael, rather—is not his first name. It's a middle name, right? And I just want to know what his real name is because I am not letting go of this like Mikey investigation.
