## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> This is the line that we should defend and stand on: standing for truth, standing for what is right, and saving lives from abortion—standing firm in the gospel. Again, it is preborn.org/Candace to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also want to tell you guys about Cozy Earth, because you work hard, you fight for your family, your values, and your future. So when the workday ends, your five to nine should be about one thing, which is comfort. That's why I love Cozy Earth. Cozy Earth is on a mission to make your evenings and every moment that you spend at home the most comfortable part of your day. Their pajamas and loungewear are made from premium, responsibly sourced viscose bamboo. They're soft, breathable, and temperature regulating, which is why I can't go a night without using them. Cozy Earth offers more than just clothing. They have perfected their bubble cuddle blanket. Their blanket offers a combination of comfort and style with its distinctively textured bubble design, intricately woven from ultra-soft fibers.
