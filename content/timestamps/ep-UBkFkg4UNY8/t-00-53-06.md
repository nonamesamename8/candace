## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment giving you the peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high interest debt, free up your cash flow and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There are no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, 800-795-1210.
