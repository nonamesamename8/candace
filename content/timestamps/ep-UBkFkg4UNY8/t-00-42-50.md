## Transcript

**Andrew Kolvet:**
> There's this great clip. When we were in Myrtle Beach and he got asked if, you know, from somebody in the audience, if he was going to, you know, debate Candace (Candace Owens) or, you know, disavow Tucker (Tucker Carlson), and Tucker—and Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s answer I thought was amazing. I remember he came off stage. He was like, "Do you like that one?" He would always ask that for reassurance. He always loved, like, "Did you see that? Do I look good? Was that a good clip? Do you think that'll go viral?" And I remember saying, like, yeah, I thought it was amazing. It was morally so crystal clear.
