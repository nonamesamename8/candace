And according to the sources at Turning Point, it was a... rather young company—meaning that the company hasn't been around for very long—that came out in a really big way in terms of sponsorship for this tour. And that's common sense, given the fact that WireFi—you will notice in the clips of the event—is the backdrop advertiser that's behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So maybe this person came because it's his first event of the season and they are the major sponsors.
