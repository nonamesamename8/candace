## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> First, I want to throw to some of our sponsors. Preborn — I've watched too many people who I am close to be vilified for standing up for truth. I've felt the sting of injustice, but I've also felt something else, which is courage. I think most of us are done playing defense. We don't want to water down what we believe to be palatable, because silence is not kindness, it's actually just consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds lives that are being ended before they even take their first breath. If we are going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like that. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For $28, that is what it costs to give an ultrasound, a free ultrasound, to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion. Just $28 will help her see the life that is growing inside of her and give her truth that the culture won't. So you shouldn't sit this one out. You shouldn't wait for permission.
