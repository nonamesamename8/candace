## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> She says a lot of stuff that sometimes I don't agree with, but that's what makes our relationship and our friendship interesting. My advice to all of you, you might not like somebody, but never tell somebody like me to stop being friends with somebody on an interpersonal level just because of disagreement. It's bad, it's what the left does, and we should rise above it as conservatives. Thank you so much. Charlie was a very loyal friend, and I'm going to continue to be a loyal friend to Charlie. I just, I can't stand it. I cannot stand to see the lies that are being told, the people that are intentionally taking things that I say out of context, who that were trying to pretend that Charlie and I weren't friends. It is maddening, but I know that God never gives any person more than they can handle, and I can handle it. And I am handling it.
