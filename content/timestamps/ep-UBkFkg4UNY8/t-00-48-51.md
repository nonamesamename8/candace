## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> There's no reason to give a baby that's almost just born hepatitis B. So I would say, wait till the baby is 12 years old and formed and take hepatitis B. And I think if you do those things, it's going to be a whole different — it's going to be a revolution in a positive sense in the country. I want to say this, the reason the government is coming out and saying this, if you have not been following the news, parents are pulling their kids out of school. I really, if you want to talk about a true turning point, and I said this a few episodes ago, I hope that what happens is that the world wakes up to the fact that the evil is taking place in the classroom.
