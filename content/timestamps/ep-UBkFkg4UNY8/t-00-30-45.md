## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now it was kind of billed, I think people were expecting, but actually Alex Clark never did say that, that Erica Kirk was going to be the one to answer questions pertaining to Charlie. and to clear up some rumors about his personal life.

I feel like it's intentionally misrepresenting what was said. Also, she was going to answer, did he take $150 million from Israel? Again, not something that we said on this show. And again, like I told you, they're going to address the SD cards.
