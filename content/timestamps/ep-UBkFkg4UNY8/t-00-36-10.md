## Transcript

**Andrew Kolvet:**
> As far as I know, no. I had never heard anything like that. Everyone I've asked has said the same thing. And by the way, just for what it's worth, it doesn't matter the amount that would have been coming down. We would have said no. And there's evidence that that is true. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would not accept foreign money. Exactly. We only took American money. There was money sent to us—like, practically in multiple instances where they're trying to cram it down our bank account— and we said no. We canceled, like, money wires and things. No foreign money, and also no handouts from the government. During the pandemic, he refused to do mass layoffs like everybody else in the country was doing. Said no to the—whatever that check was. What was that that they were handing out? Stimulus check. Yeah, the PPE loans, right? I always get PPP and PPE mixed up.
