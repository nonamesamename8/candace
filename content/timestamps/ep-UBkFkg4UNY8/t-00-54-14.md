## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And then on the right, you're supposed to go, trans. It's a trans person. We've talked about this and da-da-da-da-da. I just knew spiritually, as soon as I found out that Charlie got hit, that this was bigger than that. I just knew, and I maintain that, and I think now everyone who maybe were going to accept the Fed slop now appreciates that everything they're telling us makes entirely no sense. And they're lying — like, they are lying about a lot. And there's only one reason to lie. It's because you have something to hide. So I say just be transparent. I don't trust people that don't just release and speak about everything if they're being deemed suspicious. Like, transparency and honesty — it makes everything easier. That's why, like I said, I have no qualms about anything that I've said on the show, because I don't lie.
