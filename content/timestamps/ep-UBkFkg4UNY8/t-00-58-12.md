## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And that says that's from Michelle. Maybe it's Michelle and Chris. I don't know if that's another path that we could pursue. I feel like I thought it was the feds who did that? I could be incorrect. A feeling is not a fact. So I will explore that. That's a good question. MC writes, "There is a call on the police scanner after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got shot, saying they were looking for someone wearing jeans, a black shirt, a black mask, and a black vest, carrying a long rifle." I heard that. I need to go over that scanner. And then they took that scanner—when they realized that 3,000 people had suddenly tuned in—they decided to privatize everything. But that is true, which is why we naturally have to ask the question: why did the public never hear that description if you only had one eyewitness testimony as to what that person was wearing? And we know that you have clear footage.
