So I took her phone, and the kids in the car with me—because they were closer down by my sister—had seen it really close up, and they saw how much Charlie (Charlie Kirk) bled. And we're all trying to process that. So I have an hour and a half in a car with my nieces and my two daughters, and I'm trying to help them through what we just saw. And they said, "Why did he bleed like that?" And I said, "There's an artery here.
