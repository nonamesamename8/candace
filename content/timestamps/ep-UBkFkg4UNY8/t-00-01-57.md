## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I also want you guys to know that he was not wearing a bulletproof vest. I was able to verify that, and there does seem to be a backstory there. Somebody had reached out who had been providing vests for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and then no longer was providing vests for him. We're looking into that, but I wanted you to know those two facts. All right. Now, jumping into what I wanted to discuss today. We thought we should go back and re-examine all of the witnesses, okay? The people who spoke out to the press in the immediate aftermath of the killing. Obviously, that's what brought us to Caldera Engineering, the man who owned a couple of houses on that block. And we found out that Caldera Engineering—a lot of the employees live on that block.
