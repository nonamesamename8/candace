## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, so to update you and to remind you, I had mentioned that, first and foremost, Tiffany Barker is a part of a very political family, a very connected family in the region. The internet sleuths just were on it. Apparently there's a whole Reddit feed, and they were able to determine that not only is she connected to a big political family that is high up in the LDS church, but she also forgot to mention—and maybe there wasn't time to mention, to be fair—that they knew Charlie (Charlie Kirk), that the daughter had sung at Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s event. So it would have been something that I think I would have said, but again, sort of in the chaos, maybe in the next morning while the manhunt is going on, and in this sort of short stint of speaking to Good Morning America, you didn't have time to give those details.
