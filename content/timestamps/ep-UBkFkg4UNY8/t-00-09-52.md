## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> George Zinn was arrested in the same area, almost in the exact spot where Charlie's SUV departs. which to me, if you think somebody is the killer, you probably wouldn't send them in the direction of someone that they just shot. So I wanted to sort of prod that narrative a little bit further. So first I want you guys, in case you don't understand the layout of this particular, if we're calling it a stadium, that he was sitting, amphitheater that Charlie was sitting, there is a tent, okay? And we're coming inward here. You can see that kind of half hexagon that's sitting there. Where that dot is, is where Charlie is sitting. And you can see there's like a bridge walkway.
