## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now, I was very clear and I am still kind of shocked by the reaction from the evangelical community. It was totally just it didn't make any sense to me, A, because Erica's a cradle Catholic. I said Charlie was attending the mass because he was. I said Charlie was playing praying the rosary because he was. And I said that as a Catholic, of course, I was egging him to take the next step. Who wouldn't? Of course, you want if you Whatever your faith is, if you're evangelical and someone's thinking about converting, you're going to want to egg them on. That totally makes sense. And it wasn't said in an evil capacity. I said the joke that I said to Charlie, take the next step. You're too smart to be a Protestant. That's a descriptor of our relationship. We were like brother and sister.
