## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Yeah, that's it. Not a big deal. Anyways, then they get to the second portion of something that I didn't say. Nobody said the number 150 million, or I didn't say the number. Tucker (Tucker Carlson) didn't. I don't know where the 150 million number came from. If I'm being honest, I said 150 million was what Benjamin Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu) spent on Operation Mockingpastor. Now, the way they're going to answer this question about whether or not Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was offered money—Israeli money—is interesting. Take a listen.
