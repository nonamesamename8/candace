## Transcript

> Her sister ran as lieutenant governor alongside Phil Lehman and actually Good Morning America reached out to Phil Lehman and somehow that is how instead of her, Phil Lehman or her sister, they ended up with her sister's children and her because they were at the event. Now regarding her, obviously you heard her explanation for why they mentioned the artery. I wanted to see if they even recorded that footage of Charlie or if they were close enough to see that. And my answer to that would be no on the basis of the footage that she gave me. She has not yet provided any footage that would suggest that her nieces saw that graphic or were able, anything that was that descriptive.
