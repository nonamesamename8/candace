## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then he gets there, and I'm not sure what the intention is. I don't know if it's just, like, obviously you're shocked. Maybe you're trying to be helpful—who knows? The security guard just kind of shoos him away immediately. And then what the guy does is he sort of just stands up, and he takes out—like, walks to the side and takes out a cell phone. So I'm going to show you that. That's—he's right there in the blue shirt. And, like, he —I don't—sends a text. As I'm watching the footage, it goes on a little bit longer. Like, sends a text, takes a photo—not entirely clear what's being done there—but it just sort of stood out to me, like, in the middle of the chaos, seeing that. And I would really like to know who that is, because we had received a ton of messages from current employees at Turning Point that had mentioned that company.
