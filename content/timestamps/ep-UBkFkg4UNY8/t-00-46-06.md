## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Pray for her. Just pray for her, because it is a huge burden to have. And she'll get through it. She will get through it because she has faith in the Lord. I also want to get to this story because I want to tell you guys we are winning in a very big way—a lot. I think the waking up, the awakening that's happening right now—left and right coming together. And I do want to shout out my lefties here, because I felt like I was one of the only people on the right who was anti-vax before it was cool. Like, I didn't—none of my kids were vaccinated, and people thought it was wacky. But before I got there, the lefty moms—left-stream moms—were actually the ones that were, like, very on it with, like, what are these products? And yeah, that was like a weird place. I didn't kind of fit in in conservative land, being, like, vocally anti-vax, and took a huge risk in doing our "Shot in the Dark" series that's available on our website. I think it's the most important series for any parent to watch.
