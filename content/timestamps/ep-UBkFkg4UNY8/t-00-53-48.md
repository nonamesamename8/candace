## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The question I have is why now from an LGBTQ person Charlie has remained consistent there. It just makes no sense. His public views on the genocide and Netanyahu, however, are the things that changed before his assassination. Yeah, I never accepted the Fed Slop. That's what I call it, just Fed Slop. The whole message is, like I said, MAGA, my dad's extra MAGA. That's supposed to make people that are on the left go, oh my gosh, see? It's because of MAGA dad. It's like so ridiculous. And then on the right, you're supposed to go trans. It's a trans person. We've talked about this and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. I just knew spiritually as soon as I found out that Charlie got hit that this was bigger than that.
