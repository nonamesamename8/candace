## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I am grateful that my husband has that business mind. I just don't actually even care to have that business mind — more than anything else, not that I couldn't learn it. But I know with a company at that size, Erica is going to really need to have someone who is very much in her corner. It breaks my heart that she doesn't have Charlie. Charlie would be exactly the kind of person. It's the beauty of a partnership, and they had a beautiful partnership. But I worry, I really do worry, and I just wanted to express that openly to you guys. I'm concerned about that for some reason, and I guess the best thing to do is just ask everybody to pray for Erica. Pray that she has the clarity to understand and have people around her who are being honest with her, because I would not want to be in her position right now.
