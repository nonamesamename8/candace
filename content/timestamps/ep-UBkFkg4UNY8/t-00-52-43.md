## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> If that debt is piling up, you're not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends in American Financing, but maybe hesitated because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. Well, there is good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment, giving you the peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There are no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, 800-795-1210.
