## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And we found out that Caldera Engineering, a lot of the employees live on that block. And then of course, I wanna be clear, it doesn't make these people guilty of anything, but I thought it was interesting that I kept seeing this theme that none of these individuals were students of UVU. I guess that's just coincidental. Just to go back, we had already discussed Tiffany Barker and that early morning GMA interview, Good Morning America interview that she did with her nieces. So I'm gonna show you that again to jog your memory because we have an update. Take a listen. We're joined now by Tiffany Barker and her nieces, Elle Steele and Mia Grant, who were all in the audience yesterday afternoon. Thank you for joining us this morning.
