## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> Take a listen. We're joined now by Tiffany Barker and her nieces, Elle Steel and Mia Grant, who were all in the audience yesterday afternoon. Thank you for joining us this morning. I know it's been a difficult day for all of you right now. Tiffany, let me begin with you. Just tell us what you remember about the scene yesterday. It was horrific. There was one shot that rang out, and everybody instantly looked around and then fell to the ground. People saw Charlie (Charlie Kirk) instantly get shot in the neck, and everybody fell to the ground. And then people started running and got run over, and I was with my family. We had 16 of us there, so five adults and like 11 children, and we instantly got separated.
