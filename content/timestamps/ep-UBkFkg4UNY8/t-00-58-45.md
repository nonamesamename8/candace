## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I heard that I need to go over that scanner and then they took that scanner when they realized that 3000 people had suddenly tuned in, they decided to privatize everything but that is true, which is why We naturally have to ask the question, why did the public never hear that description if you only had one eyewitness testimony as to what that person was wearing? And we know that you have clear footage. Obviously you have tons of clear footage. Why didn't you release it? Was it because we were gonna see somebody in tactical gear? that looked foreign or we were going to be able to identify the person further and realize that it wasn't Tyler Robinson, I maintain that Tyler Robinson is one piece of this and a lot more people are involved.
