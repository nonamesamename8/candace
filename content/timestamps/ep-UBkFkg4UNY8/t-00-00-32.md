## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We noticed that a lot of the eyewitnesses and the people that were sharing those videos weren't exactly random college students from UVU, but rather people that either had strong ties to the government or to Turning Point USA altogether. So what gives? Also, later on, we're going to discuss Andrew Kolvet (Andrew Kolvet), the PR agent, close friend of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who sat down with Alex Clark (Alex Clark) to answer questions pertaining to whether or not Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was converting to Catholicism and whether or not he was offered $150 million from Israel. Except I literally do not know who said either of those things, but we'll see how he responded.
