## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> I remember that we were like 15 feet away, and I thought, like, the shot was like a firecracker or something. It just didn't seem real. After that we went, like, behind where Charlie Kirk was, and then we were meeting up at the tennis courts and trying to find everyone and get everyone together, and Charlie Kirk was such a good guy. I'm gonna miss him so much. I've always watched all of his videos and I can't imagine what you went through yesterday. Thanks for sharing your stories this morning.
