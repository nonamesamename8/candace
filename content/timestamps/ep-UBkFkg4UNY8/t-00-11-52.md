## Transcript

> But I found it again odd that George Zinn is arrested in the exact same area that they just took Charlie and it's fast, right? And it's especially fast because we then found footage of George Zinn after the shot rings out and we're gonna watch this. He's gonna get up and people are dispersing everywhere and he kind of calmly gets up and starts making his way down that stadium. You can see that here. We have the light on him. And his pants fall down by themselves. You can see that his pants did not like we were kind of under working under the assumption that his pants fell down because I don't know that the police were pulling him. But that's actually incorrect. They just fall down all by themselves.
