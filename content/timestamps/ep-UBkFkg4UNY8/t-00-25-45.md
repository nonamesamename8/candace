## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Of course, I don't have access to any autopsy reports like you might, but if they found small shards of copper rather than one large copper coated lead slug, that's the gun and bullet I would expect was used. So I wanted to share that because I know that a part of this entire thing was our upset at kind of being taken for a ride by the FBI. It makes no sense to me that they wouldn't share those details immediately while this manhunt was taking place. We got every other name and basically every other description and we're told nothing like what this person who says that he was an eyewitness, he was the eyewitness to this.
