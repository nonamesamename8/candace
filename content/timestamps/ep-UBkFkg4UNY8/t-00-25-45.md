## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> It makes no sense to me that they wouldn't share those details immediately while this manhunt was taking place. We got every other name and basically every other description, and we're told nothing like what this person who says that he was an eyewitness—he was the eyewitness to this— and that he went right into all this information. Why wouldn't you share the eyewitness report that you received that completely counters the narrative? And I would say, again, assuming this guy's story checks out—and it seems to me that it did, and he sent us the data and we looked at the metadata—that he was the person who took that video. It doesn't make sense to me.
