## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

And I'm sure there are lawyers involved as well. He went onto the Alex Clark podcast. Now it was kind of billed—I think people were expecting—but actually Alex Clark never did say that—that Erika Kirk was going to be the one to answer questions pertaining to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and to clear up some rumors about his personal life.
