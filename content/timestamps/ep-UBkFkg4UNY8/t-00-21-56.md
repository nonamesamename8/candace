## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> What he said to me completely betrays the narrative of what the FBI has put out. I am working to quadruple confirm exactly who this individual is. But he was very much—and maybe this is a poor way of saying it— a straight shooter. Said, yes, you know, I have a training— I don't want to give too many identifying details here, but this person himself has a lot of experience with guns and knows guns and, you know, helps to train people in that sort of a capacity. And said that they observed that individual. The FBI saying that the shooter dropped onto the roof at 12:15

## Claims Made

- [factual] Shooter arrived on roof earliest at 12:22, wore tactical gear and face mask, not jeans; used smaller rifle than FBI found; looked like highly trained foreign agent; sprinted away after shot; metadata from 12:22-12:23
  - *Follow-up:* Metadata verification, comparison to official FBI description and autopsy/ballistics
