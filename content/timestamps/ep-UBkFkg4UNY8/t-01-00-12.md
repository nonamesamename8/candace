## Transcript

> Because I have found that my son really loves Mass, the portions of Mass where he knows what's going on. So I'm like, well, we need to do more of that. And obviously, we go to the Latin Mass, which makes it a bit trickier for him. But I'm like, well, why not? Can they learn a Latin prayer? So I wanted to get involved because I'm still a young Catholic student in many ways and teach them that, because it would be, you know, also an opportunity for me to learn as if I was a preschooler. We are still working on that and I will definitively share all that information publicly because I want to inspire moms to take their kids out of schools, all of them. I want you, if you're listening and you're on the fence and you're like, I know spiritually I shouldn't be sending them there, there is a communist underground in this school. What they want your kids to do is to do drugs.
