## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And yep, we're coming inward right there, where you can see the mouse pointing—right there is where the SUVs were waiting, the SUV that carried Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So they just went backwards from where the tent was, okay? And that underpass is right here. You can see a clear image of it, and you can actually see now we're in that underpass and are sitting—we are kind of where that SUV was. And you can see the back of the tent that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was in. We were able to determine that it was approximately 40 seconds from the time that the shot rang off to when the security brings Charlie (Charlie Kirk) into the waiting SUV. So they moved very quickly from shots to getting him into the SUV, obviously trying to save his life.
