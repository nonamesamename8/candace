## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And recently, she told me that her hair hurts. And I said, sweetie, I don't think that's a thing. And then she just sort of went, "Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Okay, we'll move on from that anyways." Yeah, it is another thing that always gets you through really tough times, obviously, is you just be around children. They are such a light. They really are such a light in this world. And I want everyone to have kids, and I want them to have lots of them, because I know the government doesn't want us to have any. They want to make our tribes smaller because they want to rule over us. And anyways, we'll have more for you tomorrow. Thank you guys so much.
