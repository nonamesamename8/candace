## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You can be just as bold and as clear and as unapologetically pro-life by heading to preborn.org/Candice right now. You give $28. You can also give 10 times that if you want to. This is the line that we should defend and stand on: standing for truth, standing for what is right, and saving lives from abortion, standing firm in the gospel. Again, it is preborn.org/Candice to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also want to tell you guys about Cozy Earth, because you work hard, you fight for your family, your values, and your future. So when the workday ends, your five to nine should be about one thing, which is comfort. That's why I love Cozy Earth. Cozy Earth is on a mission to make your evenings and every moment that you spend at home the most comfortable part of your day.
