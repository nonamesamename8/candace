## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Charlie built that company. And I... I don't know why, but it just sickens me to hear any lies or misrepresentations. It just makes me so angry. But I know that that's something that I have to deal with, my choice emotion. I guess that's my vice, is I always have to pull myself back consciously from wanting vengeance. And I don't want vengeance right now. I just want Christ. Christ is King because Christ is truth. And I want the truth about what happened. And we're not getting it at that moment. Miriam writes, "British Muslim here. Love the work you're doing and I so stand by the point that this is good versus evil, slaves versus the elites. Yes, you are amazing and I keep you and your family in my prayers."
