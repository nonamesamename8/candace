## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Again, things are moving unbelievably quickly, and I have now watched that footage from many angles. And there's another thing that happens in the immediate aftermath that stands out to me. There is what I assume must be a donor, a sponsor of some description, or an employee of a donor/sponsor. And he tries to get close to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) after the shots are fired, but not in, like, a rescue way. There was already, like, a team of men that fly in.
