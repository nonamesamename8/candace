## Transcript

**SPEAKER_3:**
> When we get in the car, we're stuck in the parking lot for like an hour and a half. My niece that was sitting right behind me in this car filmed Charlie getting shot. She was filming him speaking, and then she said, "Tiff, I have it on video." And I said, "Give me your phone. I don't want you to watch it. Give me the phone." So I took her phone, and the kids in the car with me, because they were closer down by my sister, had seen it really close up, and they saw how much Charlie bled. And we're all trying to process that. So I have an hour and a half in a car with my nieces and my two daughters, and I'm trying to help them through what we just saw. And they said, "Why did he bleed like that?" And I said, "There's an artery here. Maybe they hit an artery." I didn't know. We didn't know anything. And we're trying to get information.
