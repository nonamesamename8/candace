## Transcript

**Charlie Kirk (archival):**
> She's a great friend, you know. Look, I don't agree with everything Candace (Candace Owens) says, but you know what I don't do? I don't stop being friends with people just because people morally blackmail me. I don't do that, and you shouldn't either. Look, I have different views on things as Candace (Candace Owens). I have different views on Israel than Candace (Candace Owens). I have different views on a lot of geopolitics. But honestly, I traveled the country with Candace (Candace Owens). I went to her wedding. I saw her meet her husband. I went to Israel with Candace (Candace Owens), which is a fun story I'll tell you at some point. But what I don't like is when people demand, you must stop being friends with somebody. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's a left-wing tactic. Don't do that. I'm not saying you do that, but other people do that. We should never resort to that. In fact, if you believe what I believe, shouldn't you want me to be friends with people that don't agree with us? Shouldn't you want me to also be a tool of influence?
