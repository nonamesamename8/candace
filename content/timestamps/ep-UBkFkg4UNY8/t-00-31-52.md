## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> whatever your faith is, if you're evangelical and someone's thinking about converting, you're going to want to egg them on. That totally makes sense. And it wasn't said in an evil capacity. I said the joke that I said to Charlie, "Take the next step. You're too smart to be a Protestant." That's a descriptor of our relationship. We were like brother and sister. It's said in humor and in jest. Hey, guys, I was Protestant like five minutes ago. And so I felt like people were looking for reasons to be offended, and wanted somebody to come out and slap that down and say, no, he wasn't attending the Mass and, you know, kind of caging this like it was a war for Charlie. It's like, no, he never took the first step in converting. But I think going to the Mass and praying the Rosary, obviously, it's going to get Catholics excited.
