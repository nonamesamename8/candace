## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That is the point of this. I did an interview earlier with a journalist, and she kind of said, what do you think, you know—podcasting getting big—what does it signify? It signifies that we don't believe the establishment anymore. And the establishment seems to be growing more radical, and they want to control speech as if that's going to make us believe them more. It's a nonsense—a terrible idea. Mary Kelly writes, "I love you, Candace (Candace Owens). You are my Joan of Arc. Prayers for you and your family. Flame of Love Rosaries." Thank you so much for that. Chris writes, "Do we know who paid for the crime scene demolition? The pavers that were so quickly put down. Normally universities don't have expendable cash. Our rosaries are with you in prayer and Mass." Thank you so much. John 12:23—he ends that with, "We love you."
