## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a very loyal friend, and I'm going to continue to be a loyal friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I just—I can't stand it. I cannot stand to see the lies that are being told, the people that are intentionally taking things that I say out of context—who were trying to pretend that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I weren't friends. It is maddening, but I know that God never gives any person more than they can handle, and I can handle it. And I am handling it. And I want to get to the bottom of what was going on, because I know he was under a tremendous amount of pressure. And like I said, I am hopeful that Erika (Erika Kirk) will speak out more thoroughly. I know she's got so much to worry about right now. I mean, chairman, CEO, and still has to be a mother.
