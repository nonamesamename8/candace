## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Again, not because I think her or her nieces had anything to do with the assassination, but because they were eyewitnesses. And I first and foremost wanted to know why Good Morning America reached out to them. It didn't seem to me that any of the videos she put out would have inspired a producer to reach out and say, "Can you be our eyewitness, provide eyewitness testimony to what took place?" And she intimated to me that actually it was a political connection. That was the reason it happened. Her sister ran as lieutenant governor alongside Phil Lyman, and actually Good Morning America reached out to Phil Lyman, and somehow that is how—instead of her, Phil Lyman or her sister—they ended up with her sister's children and her, because they were at the event.
