## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And now they're like, hey, what if we lax up? Not one inch—not our kids. All right, guys, before we get into some of your comments, I want to tell you about Sauna Space, because when you are a mother with kids and you have a nonstop schedule, you're still expected to look good, feel good, and function without losing your mind. And that is why I am obsessed with Sauna Space. You've seen those red light panels that are trendy, but this is totally different. It's the Glow Infrared Therapy Light from Sauna Space. It helps with screen fatigue, and it's amazing for your skin. In the morning, it's like natural sunlight—warm, comforting—and it resets your body clock. And at night, it helps you relax and get ready for a seriously deep sleep. You can even use it as a pain relief on the sore muscles or cramps if you have them. And the real game changer is their Fire Light Sauna. It's portable and it's powerful.
