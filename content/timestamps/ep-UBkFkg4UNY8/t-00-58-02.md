## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Thank you so much for that. Chris writes, do we know who paid for the crime scene demolition? The pavers that were so quickly put down. Normally universities don't have expendable cash. Our rosaries are with you in prayer and mass. Thank you so much. John 12, 23, he ends that with, we love you. And that says that's from Michelle. Maybe it's Michelle and Chris. I don't know if that's another path that we could pursue. Feel like I thought it was the feds who did that? I could be incorrect. A feeling is not a fact. So I will explore that. That's a good question. MC writes, there is a call on the police scanner after Charlie got shot saying they were looking for someone wearing jeans, a black shirt, a black mask, and a black vest carrying a long rifle.
