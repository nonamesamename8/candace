## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All of this takes place in under two minutes. Not the vibe that I got, obviously, when you are behind your cell phone and you're getting all of these updates and you're trying to follow all the X accounts to see who has the newest information. I certainly was not under the impression that it all took—that all took place in just two minutes. So then that photo starts circulating online. You know which photo I'm talking about. It's George Zinn, and he's bent down, and he is in handcuffs, and that goes viral. And so I wanted to get to the bottom of that—who actually shared that photo of George Zinn in handcuffs. And I was able to determine that that was somebody who lived in Utah, who advertises with Turning Point USA. And when he did some press about it, he didn't mention that connection to Turning Point USA, but he for sure advertises with them or has advertised in the past.
