## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I said, do you know who took the video? And he said, no, I don't know who took the video. And when I asked the person who sent it to me to tell me who did—because I have all of these journalists, including yourself, reaching out to me, trying to get to the bottom of it—he just stopped answering me. I said, so your friend who sent you this video just stops answering you, and he then sends me a screenshot of a conversation that they're having on an app that I don't recognize, right? So we are prodding that, and he has been responsive, so I'm sure he'll tell me what app this is. And sure enough, the person says, well, there were two people actually who took that footage—which obviously is impossible—but there are two people that were involved in taking that footage, and he sends him two numbers. And those two numbers were both Chicago-based.
