## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I know that that will kind of, it will change with time. I know that you're never a year on, however you feel a year on, it will be better. And so I hold onto that. Carl writes, my wife and I love your show Gang Gang. Thanks for always asking questions. You've opened a lot of people's eyes up to the obvious lying that is going on around us. That is the point of this. I did an interview earlier with a journalist and she kind of said, what do you think, you know, podcasting getting big, what does it signify? It signifies that we don't believe the establishment anymore. and the establishment seems to be growing more radical and they want to control speech as if that's going to make us believe them more. It's a nonsense, a terrible idea. Mary Kelly writes, I love you, Candice. You are my Joan of Arc. Prayers for you and your family. Flame of love, Rosaries.
