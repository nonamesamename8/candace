**SPEAKER_1:**
> You can figure it out. That's what I wanna say to you guys. You can figure it out. They make you think you can't. We are in their matrix. Let's get out of the psychopathic matrix.

Not one inch, not our kids. All right, guys, before we get into some of your comments, I want to tell you about Sauna Space because when you are a mother with kids and you have a nonstop schedule, you're still expected to look good, feel good, and function without losing your mind. And that is why I am obsessed with Sauna Space. You've seen those red light panels that are trendy, but this is totally different. It's the Glow Infrared Therapy Light from Sauna Space. It helps with screen fatigue and it's amazing for your skin. In the morning, It's like natural sunlight, warm, comforting, and it resets your body clock.
