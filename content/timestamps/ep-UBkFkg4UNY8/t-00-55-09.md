## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Jenna V. writes, thank you for fighting so hard for that precious human being, Charlie Kirk. He was amazing. I mean, I could say it a thousand times. There truly would not be me without Charlie. And I know that I held his head up during tough times, you know, when you are climbing and fighting through politics, that early phase. You're unknown. You go through a lot of really tough times and you're tired. And similarly, he held my head up during a lot of tough times. And like I said, reading the messages of me, yeah, while we were sick, tired, we just always made it work. And he built that company. Charlie built that company. And I... I don't know why, but it just sickens me to hear any lies or misrepresentations. It just makes me so angry.
