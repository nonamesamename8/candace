## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) always said he felt like he was a time traveler. And this is a conversation: I would say, "I'm an alien." I just messaged him from across the globe. And he said, "I think I'm a time traveler. This is my home." He felt like Earth was his planet. But I think you found me and time traveled with me. Like—the kind of friendship where you can talk about being a time traveler and feeling like an alien—as I've always felt like it—because I don't get it. I don't get the rules of this planet. I don't get the betrayal, the backstabbing, the people that dance for money. It's never made sense to me. From the time I was a kid, I just felt out of place. And I am out of place in politics. I will tell you that because this is what it's all about, right? Selling your soul to the devil. I don't want to do that.
