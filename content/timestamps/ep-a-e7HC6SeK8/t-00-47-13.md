## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Apparently Tyler Bowyer (Tyler Bowyer) has a younger brother who—for 10 years—has worked in dental sales until Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, because a unique opportunity presented itself at Turning Point USA where Tyler (Tyler Bowyer) had begun telling people that TPUSA plans to roll out a program to build houses for first-time home buyers. They're gonna use Turning Point USA's position and audience to market this idea of new homes, and the marketing pitch is that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) preached to young Christians about how school and universities was a waste of time and that it was a waste of money and that they should get married early and they should start their lives and they should have kids.
