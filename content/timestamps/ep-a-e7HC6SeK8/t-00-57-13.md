## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> for an eternity, okay? It's gonna be like nothing you could possibly imagine. This life is short. Charlie's was shorter, a short end, but this life is short relative to eternity, and that is real. And I commit myself to truth, and I just decided that I'm gonna stay on the side of truth and I am going to keep enduring these attacks and stand with the people. Seven Sheets writes, it feels like you're the only close friend really mourning him. I've been there. I'm so sorry for your loss. Please stay strong. Thank you. I appreciate that. Yacra writes, many blessings, Candace, from Anton Daniels and the Bag Chasers. Keep fighting the good fight. Snowy writes, integrity, courage, intelligence, articulate, as beautiful inside as outside.
