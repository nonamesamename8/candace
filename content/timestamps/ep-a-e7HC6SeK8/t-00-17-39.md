## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> to Turning Point USA from UVU—UVU's chapter—for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to have this event. That's very late in the day already, but again, we see no proof of this. We do know that right after that, our Egyptian yellow plane flies to Lincoln, Nebraska, and two days later, it is announced in Nebraska that they're going to be doing a trade and investment trip with Egypt. There was some private off-record meeting that took place to make this come to fruition, and there were international professionals that were there, per the media. But who were these professionals that met with Secretary of State Bob Evnen? Why is this meeting somehow off-record?
