## Transcript

We are going to get Trump elected, and we're going to get people to stop talking about racism and sexism and to understand—like—family is a priority. And I realize now, and... I know Charlie (Charlie Kirk) realizes now that we did not see the evil that was around us. And I'm gonna miss that youth. Do you know what I mean?
