## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Candace (Candace Owens) from the eyes of a 79-year-old." Thank you. I love meeting your generation because I do think that that was the last generation that had real values. You know—America lost its way when we decided that we would do anything for money—which is what Benjamin Netanyahu said on camera. You know—"America is something you can move very easily with money." Not this American—so there's that. And Amir writes, "I voted for my taxpayer funds to go from the CIA towards the Candace (Candace Owens) Intelligence Agency for all of her investigative work because at this point she is one of the rare public figures that are actually fighting for truth." Sadly—I mean—I just really thought there would be more allies. And there are some. Like I said, there are some good feds. There is an underground movement that is happening.
