## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I think we are in the rest right now. We are approaching that future right now. And I didn't feel it then in 2018, but I feel it now. I've been telling you guys: I have been having a lot of dreams. And the dread that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) felt in 2018, I have been feeling. I felt it leading up to Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination. I pulled my children out of school. I was having these dreams and visions about bees and organization that was happening in America. I have a sense of dread that a lot of these events that are happening—these inexplicable events like the Malibu fires, sort of coastal events, the Texas floods—that this is not happening by accident, okay?
