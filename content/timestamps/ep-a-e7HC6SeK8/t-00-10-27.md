## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> She was killed by three hired hands. And as Dominick Dunne reported in Vanity Fair, the money traced back to the DuPont family. It appeared that Lisa Dean, who is a DuPont, didn't approve of her drug-addicted son dating a drug-addicted Vegas sex worker. So she and her husband, Christopher Mosley, had her killed. Both John DuPont and Mosley died in prison. Okay, great, cool. France, France in the story. We've got an alleged murder for hire. I guess not an alleged murder. It's not alleged, it's just murder for hire. We've got incest.
