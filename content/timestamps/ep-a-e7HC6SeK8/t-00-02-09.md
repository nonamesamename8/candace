## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> "I believe that the purpose of Macron's (Emmanuel Macron's) lawsuit was that it was supposed to go nowhere because Candace (Candace Owens) was supposed to have been assassinated before the case got to court." Then they could forever claim that Candace was lying, which is evident by the fact that they were suing her for, quote-unquote, "defamation," before someone had killed her. "This was their plan, but I pray that it has now been foiled." I had never considered that, and that hit really deeply, and that is a dark thought. And I think now I am wondering. I have a lot of questions. Everything feels different in this post-Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk world. Where to begin? How about we should talk about the founding of America? Because, man, those Catholic priests that I was telling you about—they were unbelievably correct.
