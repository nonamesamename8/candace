## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> False flag attack—get the media going—"We have to respond"—and then we just sort of take land. Yeah, that's what we do. Now, France had said in a statement on that morning—on April 14th—that "France's red line had been crossed." So this was a story which Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said, "This is not the thing that's coming, but this is a preview of the thing that's coming." Missiles, false flag attacks, chemicals, and the Middle East—America, France, and Israel. It is something. It is something, right? This was the vibe of something that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) felt was going to happen in the future. Something Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—I just always say—"I told you that the rest is future."
