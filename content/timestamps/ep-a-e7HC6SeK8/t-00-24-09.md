## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Then we have the first public sign that went out on August 27th. August 27th, that's so late in the day to begin promoting an event.

On the 29th, we have Operation Bright Star, which commences—that joint operation that we told you about, which is biennial between Egypt and the United States military and other countries that are coming together.
