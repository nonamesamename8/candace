## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Then we have the first public sign that went out on August 27th. August 27th—that's so late in the day to begin promoting an event. TPUSA, UVU, and a local BYU chapter share a graphic announcing that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is coming to UVU, but there are no location details mentioned on that graphic—so still not full details, but at least the first announcement goes out. On the 29th, we have Operation Bright Star, which commences—that joint operation that we told you about, which is biennial between Egypt and the United States military and other countries that are coming together. And it is being reported that it is going to run through to September 10th.
