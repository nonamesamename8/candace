## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> He didn't just say that he was gonna die. He didn't just say that Turning Point was going to be the death of him. But he also wrote this. This is on April 13th. He wrote this: Hero-ish like tonight is what I have foreseen.

America, France, Israel, the Middle East, Syria, Russia, and this is the Syria before Israel and the United States overthrew Assad.
