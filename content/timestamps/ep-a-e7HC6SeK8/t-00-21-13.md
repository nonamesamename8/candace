> But I don't know if he said, I only want to do that going forward. But I do know that Turning Point USA insisted upon that. The person that was orchestrating that event, Macy, Macy Crofts, was saying, like, this is what Charlie wants, and that could be true. August 2nd is when we have our French Legionnaires arriving in America for a three-week training session in California, which is going to end on the 25th. And then, a couple of days later, we have that Hamptons retreat, which Charlie Kirk himself described as an intervention, as an Israel intervention.
