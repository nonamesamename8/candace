## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

My mouth was wide when you dropped the name DuPont. I cried tonight. I love you, and I love Charlie (Charlie Kirk) from the get-go. A big part of my everyday was ripped from me when they killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." "You are true blue when the turn is out and impossible to deny."
