## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And you need real friends in this world. You actually need real friends—friends that are going to stand up when everyone is lying about everything—about what happened to you on that day. And we've discovered more, by the way—but, you know—it's only Tuesday. So we'll give you more. We'll give you more tomorrow. Anyways, you guys—to get to some housekeeping: some great news. My book, Make Him a Sandwich, is not just available on the Make Him a Sandwich website—which is MakeHimASandwich.com—but now it is available on Amazon. So you can get that; you can go to Amazon.com, and you can now get that delivered directly to you. I think, by the way, George put a note that it says that it's not in stock. That's not true. It just means Amazon hasn't received our shipment yet.
