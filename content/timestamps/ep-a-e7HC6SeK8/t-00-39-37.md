## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I'm gonna miss that young experience. I'm gonna miss Charlie (Charlie Kirk) going on dates and the girl that he liked and me always being the wing woman and him asking. This text message is one of my favorite text messages between me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) when he was getting ready to go on a date, and, you know, he didn't date many people. And he was just kind of in love with this girl. And he was asking me, "Should I wear this?" And this is the text message. It's so sweet. He said, "Do I have to change this shirt?" And I wrote back, "Yes—and throw it away if you can, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." And he writes, "Okay." And he's wearing a Turning Point—early shirt that somebody, I think, gave to him. It's stitched on. Is it stitched on?
