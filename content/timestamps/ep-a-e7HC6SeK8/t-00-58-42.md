## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> But there's not nearly enough for the amount that we pay our taxes. I'll tell you that for free. Joy writes, this is deep. I've been watching Ken Burns' The Revolution. The French connection is long with America. It is. And silly us for thinking they just kind of did us a favor and said, sayonara, right? No way. Of course, that's not how it happened to us. Silly Americans. Anyways, you guys, we're gonna jump into book club. Support the show. You can do that in a variety of ways. Like I said, buying gear. We've got new kit available on the website, which we're excited about. And you can, of course, buy the book, which is available on Amazon. And we're gonna keep pushing. Today was definitely an episode where I feel like we went max for Charlie. So we'll see you tomorrow.
