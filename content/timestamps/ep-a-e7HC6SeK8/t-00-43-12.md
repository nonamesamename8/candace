## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> What was going on was the United States and France were carrying out a series of military strikes involving aircraft and these ship-based missiles against multiple government sites in Syria. And the official reason that we were told was because the Syrian government had apparently chemically gassed their own citizens—something which Assad had strenuously denied. In effect—if Assad was telling the truth, and I believe he was because I think there's a war on Christians that's happening—then the West and the United States were implicated in part by a false flag attack to justify a larger military justification. That's kind of something the West does a lot, right?
