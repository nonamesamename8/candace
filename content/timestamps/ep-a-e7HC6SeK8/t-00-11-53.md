## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We've got a couple of blocks here, and we told you yesterday: we've got this FBI suite in this building that's actually owned by the Wilmington Trust at 500 Delaware Avenue. We've got Brigitte's lawyers at 919 North Market Street. Also in that building happens to be Stacey Sheridan's registered agent. That's Stacey Sheridan of Turning Point USA. We're going to talk about her in a second. We've got the Wilmington Trust actual location, which is at 1100 North Market. We told you about this crane—this red crane—at 1100 North King Street, and that's Bridge Complex, which is supposed to house Insight headquarters, and they've got a French CEO.
