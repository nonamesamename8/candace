## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> But he never really taught them how or what they should do next. So they are planning to leverage Turning Point USA's position with young Christians as a captive audience to sell—to build and sell—houses. Okay, that's what the person told me, and I checked that out. They presented some proof of that conversation happening. And I think that's interesting. I think we should share that. And I know that I'm sure that that's probably what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would— He apparently had a 15–20 year plan according to Frank Turek. Or was it Rob McCoy? Rob McCoy said that, I think. I think they all said it—honestly—but Rob McCoy did say that. He kept this in his notebooks.
