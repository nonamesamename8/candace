## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Richards, again, accused of raping two of his own children, was instead released on a $60,000 bail and eventually copped a plea deal that involved him admitting that he had abused his children but received that lesser charge, a fourth-degree rape. Okay. Now, the article goes on to tell us that this is hardly the first time that the DuPont family has found itself the focus of unsavory headlines. John DuPont shot Olympic wrestler David Schultz dead in the driveway of the family's mansion in 1996. Two years later, the decomposing body of a Las Vegas prostitute was found stuffed in the air conditioner of a seedy motel.
