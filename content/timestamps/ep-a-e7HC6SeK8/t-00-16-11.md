## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And now would be the appropriate time for us to get back into that timeline because there is an important question that we forgot to ask. So let's jump into our timeline, beginning with the inflection point, which was that Tucker Carlson speech. Now, I want to say this. On that July 11th when Tucker Carlson gave that speech, I did—and I hope I'm not betraying anything too private here—but I asked Tucker about that speech. I was like, what inspired you? I went back and watched it, and he's going hard, and he's talking about where's all this money coming from, and, you know, is this even a meritocracy? Why are people that are not impressive billionaires? What's happening in this country? I asked Tucker, what made you say that? And he said, I had no plan to say it.
