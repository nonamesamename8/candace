## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> But the one I'm speaking about is Cloverstone Ventures. Stacey, by the way, is the senior advancement director at Turning Point USA. She was brought in specifically by Tyler Bowyer to raise money and to take Turning Point to the next level. And regarding Tyler Bowyer, now we could say— maybe a couple of weeks ago—that he's a criminal, but actually Donald Trump pardoned him. He pardoned Tyler Bowyer a couple of weeks ago. So we can't—that's actually not real. He's been pardoned. But he is always up to no good, I can tell you that. And he brings in this Stacey Sheridan. I gotta tell you, I did not like her at all. Just the vibe was off. I did not like her, and I expressed that to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to his face when she was hired. That's when I kind of notoriously said to him, "You can't go down this path with money, okay?
