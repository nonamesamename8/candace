What's the—what is the structure here of these contracts that even people that are in PR—people that are like running PR departments—are getting tips on the basis of donations? I don't know how this is working, but we need to figure out how this is working. I think— I think it's really important that we learn the truth about what happened. Who's Pierre? Is it Pierre du Pont? And has Turning Point been paid? Obviously it wouldn't be on this year's taxes. You're not going to find those on this year's taxes, but they would be on next year's.
