## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And it tells us that Robert Richards the Fourth was in 2009 convicted of raping his three-year-old daughter, seven years after she—who was just five—told relatives that she didn't want her father to be touching her anymore. Then it says, in an alarming twist, the judge who sentenced the heir to the DuPont fortune let him off with no jail time, arguing that the six-foot-four Richards will not fare well in prison. That was the argument that the lawyer made, and the courts in Delaware found that to be valid. So instead of sentencing him to prison for raping a toddler, it goes on and tells us that Judge Jan Jordan rules that Richards would benefit from treatment instead.
