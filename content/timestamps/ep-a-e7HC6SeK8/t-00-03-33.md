## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> A war that had been sort of waging across Europe for centuries had then spilled into America. It was largely a spiritual war. It was really a theological war. That's what I'm starting to realize. That's why America never really had an appetite for Orthodox or Catholicism because the Catholics and the Orthodox have kept history. They know what was going on in Europe—not the fake history that's packaged and sold to Americans. They know what the Freemasons were up to—Freemasons who caused all of those revolutions against really the Christian empire across Europe. The idea, really—I now think—is to keep Americans fat, dumb, drugged, and propagandized, right?
