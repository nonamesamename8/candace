## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And there's one more thing that came in regarding Andrew Kolvet. A very close family friend of Andrew Kolvet had messaged me early on. And I—again—was not tracking any of this at the time, but they had said that they felt that Andrew Kolvet was acting weird. And I'm sure that's not a big deal. I think we were all acting weird because he was assassinated. But moreover, they had mentioned that specifically Andrew had told them that when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said no to Benjamin Netanyahu, he lost out on millions. Now, I'm going to say allegedly because this is a tip, but I have that tip in writing. I'm not lying to you. And I thought to myself, "That is so weird."
