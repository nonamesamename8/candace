## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Is it ironed on? I don't know. But I was like, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk), burn it." Obviously burn that shirt. And it makes me—yeah—it's the stuff that makes me cry and makes me sad because he just was so young. You know, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was so young, and he was such a good person. And I'm also going to miss the young conversations that you have when you're vibing with someone and you're speaking about things that you don't understand as you were coming up in politics. I always felt like an alien. We would have these discussions with donors, and we'd have discussions with people or people would do stuff, and I would just tell him all the time, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I'm an alien. I am new on this planet. I don't understand this. I don't understand double speak. You know—contracts and people threatening to sue. It doesn't make sense to me. I'm an alien."
