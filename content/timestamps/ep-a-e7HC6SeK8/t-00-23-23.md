## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Charlie says no, and almost immediately, 10 days later, we got our next point, is that our planes come back out and they're flying to Lincoln. Again, they're going to Omaha. They're going to Wilmington. They stay for one night. Charlie speaks in South Carolina. We have our yellow planes then returning on the 24th, again always through Wilmington, to Egypt. We then have our French Legionnaires have completed their training. And on August 24th–27th, Operation Valhalla takes place between civilians and military men in Minnesota at Camp Ripley.
