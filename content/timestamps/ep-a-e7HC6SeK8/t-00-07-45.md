## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Critics have since noted that such treatment is usually offered only to drug addicts or those in possession of child pornography—not convicted rapists. And the details of the case became public this month when Richards' ex-wife sued him for damages related to the abuse of their daughter. Here is how the News Journal describes the convicted rapist. In this case, quote, "Richards, who is unemployed and supported by a trust fund, owns a 5,800-square-foot mansion in Greenville that he bought for $1.8 million in 2005." He also lists a home in the exclusive North Shores neighborhood near Rehoboth Beach, according to the state's sex abuse registry.
