## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. Happy Tuesday. I'm gonna ask you a question. It's actually a riddle that we're all familiar with. What came first, the chicken or the egg? That's what's on my mind. That's what's on my mind really all day because yesterday we were explaining to you guys this sort of random coincidence—maybe not a coincidence— of the FBI seemingly choosing to work in offices that are kind of being run by, like, French royalty, in essence, right? These old French American families. Now, why would our FBI do that? Surely they would have been aware that they were choosing to work in buildings that might potentially have some foreign interests. But then you know what? It clicked. The chicken came before the egg. Of course. Don't be ridiculous. That's the answer to the riddle.
