> Now, this type of theft doesn't happen by breaking down your doors and stealing your stuff. It happens with just a one-page document that has a forged signature that can get filed at the county. And if your title, which is the legal record of ownership, gets transferred out of your name, criminals can then use your ownership to drain your equity or even sell your property. And you won't even know about it until you start getting collection notices and foreclosure notices in the mail. That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock, so that you can protect your equity and find out today if you're already a victim.

That is 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes.
