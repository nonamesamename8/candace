## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Tells us that his great-grandfather is the DuPont family patriarch, Irénée du Pont, and his father is Robert H. Richards, a retired partner in the Richards, Layton & Finger law firm.

No, until literally yesterday, because Richards didn't sound to me like DuPont. So I had not put two and two together as I was doing this episode talking about the DuPont family. I hadn't realized that the people that are filing paperwork for me
