## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> LOL to the American history that's taught to us in the public schools. The French helped to establish the United States. They came over and they helped us win our big independence from the big bad Brits. And then what? They just left us alone. It was just an act of charity. Like, we're good. We want nothing in return. We just want you guys to be free. Does that make sense to you? Come on. Turns out, actually—and you may have known this; maybe I'm just American ignorant—but our FBI was founded by the French. In theory, the FBI really is in France's building over in Wilmington. If you think about it for a long time—and I have now been thinking about this for a long time. So welcome back to Candace.
