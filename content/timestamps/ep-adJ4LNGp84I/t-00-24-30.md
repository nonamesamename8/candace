Also telling you guys about Paleo Valley. I love them. Something that my team and I are always craving are healthy beef sticks, specifically the ones from my friends over at Paleo Valley. Paleo Valley makes their meat sticks with 100% grass-fed beef, of course, sourced from small-scale regenerative American farms, so that you can feel good about what you're eating and what you're supporting. They have stripped out all of the junk. There's no preservatives, gluten, soy, sugar, dairy, or GMOs, just clean, nutrient-dense fuel, the way food was meant to be. So whether you're road-tripping, you're working late, you're running around with the kids, these sticks will deliver you high protein energy without the crash.
