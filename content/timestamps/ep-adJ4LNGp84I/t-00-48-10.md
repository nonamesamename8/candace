## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I was like, they're just gonna see what you wanna hide and go straight there. So you're basically taking on the process of filtering for them. That's my conspiracy theory. One of many that I have, as you guys know, because you listen to the show. Lily writes, first they made a false statement about Candace (Candace Owens) not being friends with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). They pushed through their minions in the media. Now they planted a fake letter in the same New York Post and their minions. Candace (Candace Owens) must be up to something. Yeah, I know who had access to Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) laptop. And I have questions about that, but I'm going to wait for the financial report to come out, which I'm not handling. And I got question marks about a couple of people over at Turning Point USA. And yeah, I think we should definitely be speaking about these shady pastors. I hope this is the year of the shady pastor.
