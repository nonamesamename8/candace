## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> He writes, if you can't separate yourself from Candace (Candace Owens), many of us are going to separate ourselves from you. She didn't mention anything about me. He says, we do not have to align with everyone that claims to be of the right when their motives and history are as shady as hers. Megyn Kelly and I have no attachment to the idea that he's demanding that she, what, make a statement against me. It's insane. She replies, she holds the line. She says, look at this. No, I have no obligation to, quote unquote, separate myself from anyone. I run my own media company and my own show. That show is where I express my own opinions and I will decide what and what not to opine on. If you need me to condemn Candace (Candace Owens) or Tucker (Tucker Carlson) for their opinions in order to listen to me, then I may not be for you.
