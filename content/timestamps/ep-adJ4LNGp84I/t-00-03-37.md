## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You can see that here. George Zin writes, "Rare to find a more caring man with uncompromising goals to make Utah great for generations than Phil Lyman, not a politician who can be pampered. Phil has a knowledge of urban and rural Utah from every corner and community. Utah is in desperate need of true leadership and representation and Phil has the passion and the values to be a great governor. He needs our support." Now, I'm not sure what to make of that. I did want to use Wayback Machine to see whether or not that was a new entry. Maybe somebody is trolling there. And no, they are not. That entry has been there at least since—and I'm gonna show you this on Wayback—at least since June 6th, 2024.
