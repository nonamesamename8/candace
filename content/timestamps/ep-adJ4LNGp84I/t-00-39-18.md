## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If she doesn't do what they say, watch that space, you guys. Watch that space. Okay, I want to make sure that I get to some of your comments because a lot of you guys have been writing in. I first want to throw it to PureTalk because our society works because of the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment. Every day, Americans should be able to speak openly about honesty, family, traditional values, without any retribution. And that's a principle that PureTalk proudly supports. They sponsor my show, which allows me to stand strong behind the microphone every day and share the truth with you. If you want to support brands that defend freedom and pro-American values, I encourage you to switch your wireless service to PureTalk. You're going to get great 5G coverage and an extremely reliable and secure network. And with plans from just $25 a month, you'll save a ton of money.
