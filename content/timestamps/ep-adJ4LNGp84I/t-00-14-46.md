## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I basically just stayed focused and said, Phil, okay, we showed your footage. He's very upset about cousin versus nephew thing. It's all irrelevant. If you're saying you actually want to help us catch the killer, right? If that's really where your heart was, if that's really why you injected yourself so much into this story, why wouldn't you, knowing how deeply I care about this, walk over while you're in the neighborhood popping by, walk over to your aunt, grandma, cousins, I don't care whose house, and say, hey, you said there was an accomplice, that there was a woman, okay, that might've been an accomplice. Do you mind letting me see the raw footage so that I can hand it over to Candace (Candace Owens)?
