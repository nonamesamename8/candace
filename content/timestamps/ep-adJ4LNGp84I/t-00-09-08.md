## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The doorbell cam footage had more." This is what the person told us. She said, the shooter is then seen changing his clothes, and he is with a woman, she told me. Then she gives me a name, and that name was another Lyman family member, and that's when my spidey senses started tingling. I'm like, okay, this is a lot of Lymans now. I want to be very clear and fair to Phil Lyman. He has been forthcoming about the fact that his family owned that property. Like, they own everything there. That is not mysterious. He's not hiding that fact. UVU in many ways purchased the university from his family, right? The acreage from his family for that university.
