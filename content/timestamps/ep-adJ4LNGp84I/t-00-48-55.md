## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> After Operation Mockingpastor, learning why they can say, we don't take money from Israel, but they take money from an agent of Israel or an organization like the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, which, if you go to their website, it's basically like, hey, Christians, here's what you can do for Jews. There's nothing that's spoken about what Christians are going through. And they flood money into that and they get you to say that it's like a fellowship program. But then they have you, like, gathering pastors and paying off people. I mean, it's an ugly business. And I think it's about to all get exposed. I think it was a bad idea to kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk). That's what I think. I think the devil overplayed his hand because that's what the devil does. The devil is arrogant. The devil has no friends.
