## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I think everybody was moved by Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. The people that held that space were willing to oblige it. So that tracks with me. That seems accurate. I just wanted to help you guys with that information. Also, another thing that I came across, and this is regarding Phil Lyman's campaign website. You guys were asking me if we came across that. Yes, I did come across that, and I actually in the short run didn't think much of it because I thought, okay, well, he was running a campaign and he has a website and maybe people were writing in reviews and saying he was a great person. But yes, we were aware that George Zin is one of just 20 people that is a featured endorsement. He endorses Phil Lyman's character.
