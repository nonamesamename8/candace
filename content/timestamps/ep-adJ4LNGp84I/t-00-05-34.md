## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Also, I told you there was a new CEO and therefore a new lead surgeon, Andrew Zenger, over at the hospital, the regional hospital that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was taken to, although that was not the nearest hospital from the university, and it also ranked extremely low in terms of the best-equipped hospital, if you will, to deal with the sort of trauma that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was suffering from, a neck wound, obviously. So it's very strange. I think it would be interesting to learn whether or not that new CEO and surgeon worked on Charlie (Charlie Kirk). That's something that I would like to find out. If you know that information, please send it to us at tips@candaceowens.com. Okay.
