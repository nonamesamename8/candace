## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> In fact, how about just giving me any of the footage that your family rushed to give to TMZ? Why did they rush to give it to TMZ? By the way, you definitely said you were at your cousin's house and that you hadn't seen the footage. You were watching it live with Kayleigh McEnany on Fox News. That's what you said during that segment, right? This is the first time I'm seeing this footage. So apparently, your cousin, close enough to go to their house, but your cousin decides to give the footage to TMZ before you can even see it. Okay, maybe the feds gave it. That's another assumption. That's the only two options. Either your cousin gave it to TMZ, or the feds gave a portion of it to TMZ, which begs the question, why were we not told about the woman? Who was the woman?
