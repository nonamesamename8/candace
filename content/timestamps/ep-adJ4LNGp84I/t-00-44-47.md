## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> on the topics of Israel, Mossad, and Palestine? They all have hinted and danced around calling you anti-Jewish, genetically speaking, and excessive in their videos. I would debate PBD. I would debate Ben Shapiro. I wouldn't debate Brandon Tatum because I love Brandon Tatum like a brother, and nobody wins in that scenario. I've just known him, like, I know Brandon. I came up with him and Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I just know him as, like, a human being. And there are some things that to me are just, like, are bigger than politics. And so any conversation or debate that I'm going to have with Brandon will be treated in the same way like the debates that I would have had with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You know, Charlie and I never threw each other under any buses publicly. And when we did disagree, we had those disagreements privately. And so I would say the same about Brandon Tatum.
