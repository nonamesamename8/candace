## Transcript

**Deborah Lee:**
> So something I would like to raise, which was actually my first published paper, was how you and the Likud party are cut from the same ideological cloth as Trump (Donald Trump) and the GOP in America. And so specifically with Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, who was a big mentor of mine, who was my first mentor in this space. Evangelicals, from all my research, evangelicals are the reason that Israel has been supported in the public sphere outside of just Jews. So with Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) assassination and with the kind of trajectory that we see with Candace (Candace Owens) and Tucker (Tucker Carlson), I guess I'm curious about what's another game plan if we lose evangelical support for the state of Israel? What's our backup plan to be strong outside of the diaspora?
