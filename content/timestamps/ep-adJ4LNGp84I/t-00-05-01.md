## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> 9/10 was everybody's first day on the job, meaning that there were a lot of these recent and brand new hires in Utah that would all kind of come across and have to deal with this case. Kash Patel, I told you, cleaned house at the State Bureau. He then installs a person that has a long tenure in DC, Robert Bowles. His first case is Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Why would he wanna uproot and move his family to Utah after having roots in Virginia for so long? I don't know, but that's the circumstance.
