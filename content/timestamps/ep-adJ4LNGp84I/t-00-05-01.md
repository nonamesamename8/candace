## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> 9/10 was everybody's first day on the job, meaning that there were a lot of these recent and brand new hires in Utah that would all kind of come across and have to deal with this case. Kash Patel, I told you, cleaned house at the State Bureau. He then installs a person that has a long tenure in DC, Robert Bowles. His first case is Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination.
