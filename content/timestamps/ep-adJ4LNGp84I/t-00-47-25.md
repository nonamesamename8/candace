## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Marzi writes, this just in: the FBI just cut ties with the ADL after Turning Point USA criticism. They share a building—just, FBI and ADL share a building. They're one and the same. I hope you guys know that. They share a building, I think, in Connecticut. Also, Israel is taking over ExpressVPN and other VPN websites. I always had a conspiracy about that. I used to read ads for them, ExpressVPN, when I was working for Daily Wire. And in back of my mind, I was like, it would make sense that they would train us to actually filter. There's so much data. So they're like, actually, why don't you pretend that this VPN hides things and so that we know exactly where to look? And once I found that it was started by an Israeli billionaire, I was like, yeah, no, that's gonna be a spying thing. That's how I felt, at least.
