The venue was indeed secured in quick order, but that was because they had help from the White House, and Turning Point did not book that venue back in May, so we can formally debunk that. I was told that the White House stepped in and put in a personal phone call to the event coordinator. And they actually did already have an event that was scheduled. And the White House simply asked those people if they would be willing to move or reschedule their event. It was apparently supposed to be an RV show, actually. And obviously, given the nature of the tragedy, it was globally traumatizing to everybody.
