## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Maybe that emptied SUBTT left in the morning, and three hours after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated—or maybe it's the next day. I'm sorry. Marcus corrected me in my ear: three days after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated—that's when the rest of the passengers left. So we have two tail numbers, and they're gonna be color-coordinated to make it really easy for you, okay? Tail number SUBND. That's a Gulfstream 4. It's about 12 to 16 passengers. And tail number SUBTT. That's gonna be our main one. That's our Falcon 7X. Again, holds about 12 to 16 passengers.
