## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So NAR is somehow going to be relevant. Again, we are at an early phase in this investigation. Let's jump back into our timeline here, okay? So he is announced that he is going to be heading up. Rob McCoy is obviously now the co-chair of TPUSA Faith. He brings on Sean Feucht, presumably. And on February 28th, Sean Feucht is announced that he's going to be heading up the Kingdom to the Capitol Tour. So he becomes the face of this Turning Point USA Faith Tour. So, and of course, the first event that they do—as I just mentioned to you—that plane gets to St. Louis, Missouri. And sure enough, Sean Feucht is there. TPUSA Faith is there.
