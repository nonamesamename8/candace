## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He's ousted from the board of his own company. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) publicly announces his support for what he perceives—like the rest of the world perceived—was a bit of a hostile takeover. Okay? February 21st, we now have BND, okay? It flies into St. Louis, Missouri, and it lands at 2:38 p.m., and it's gonna stay until May. The blue one you're gonna see stays longer when it arrives, and then the yellow one will come behind it. BTT will come behind it, okay? So on February 25th, BTT comes in. And BTT—again, they're both flying from Cairo every time, typically through Paris—and it then lands in St. Louis, Missouri.
