## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Joel Osteen—like the plumber was fixing a toilet and found like a million bucks in the wall. Do you remember this story? Megachurch pastor Joel Osteen—his church. I think it was—I gotta pull it up if you can find it, Skylar. The plumber is like, "Hey, I'm here to fix the toilet," and finds that actually there's like almost a million dollars of cash in one of the walls. And I think Joel Osteen issued a statement and was like, "Oh, well, you know, we are very surprised to see this." "It's very strange. This is in the walls of our church. That's amazing." God has blessed us greatly for supporting Israel. I'm joking—he didn't say that—but I think the excuse that he gave. Here it is: the plumber doing repairs—November 10th—at the megachurch, blah, blah, blah. There was a loose toilet in the wall. We removed the tile, and boom—500 envelopes fell out of the wall.
