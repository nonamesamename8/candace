## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You recognize something is wrong. That's why you're watching this show. You are recognizing that the people around Charlie (Charlie Kirk) are not acting in the way that they should be acting—that their emotionality is not meeting the moment of violence that we all witnessed. Instead, they're turning on me. They're making videos about me for investigating. They're lying to you about where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was on his faith journey. That's hush-hush. The Catholic thing must stay hush-hush. Why? It's all kind of adding up, right? They're attacking Tucker (Tucker Carlson) because he's attacking Christian Zionism. They're angry at Charlie (Charlie Kirk) because it's looking like he might get off the Christian Zionist reservation—because that's what it is, okay? That's a plantation. And what they are mining is your emotion.
