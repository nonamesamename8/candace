## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Joke's on you if you think Turning Point USA is a Christian organization. It's a Mormon one, okay? And Tyler Bowyer said to me backstage: there was something going on with like Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Nick Fuentes. I can't recall. This is again 2024. And I said to him, "Why don't you just have Charlie (Charlie Kirk) debate Nick? Like the common-sense thing to me is just like have the debate, right? It's not a big—it's like all of this." I think Nick had maybe come actually to the conference with like some people because he was doing that for a little bit. And I was like, "Why don't you just like debate them? Like, I don't know—I'm like pro-conversation." And Tyler said to me, "Turning Point USA will never—will just always be pro-Israel. Like we're just never not gonna be pro-Israel." Didn't think anything of it at the time, but in retrospect, it's kind of a weird thing to say. Like, what do you mean it will never be anti-Israel? What do you mean it will always be pro-Israel?
