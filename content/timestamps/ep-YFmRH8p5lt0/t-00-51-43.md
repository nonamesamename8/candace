## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I think what we have an understanding of is an apparatus that wasn't about anything but faith, okay? I think actually when I now look at the picture—and I'm learning more about Rob McCoy and knowing that he was the co-chair in 2024 or maybe in 2023 of Turning Point USA— they believe—and this is why the Christian Zionism thing becomes so important—that they can hijack our emotions and tell us that it's our biblical duty to support the state of Israel because I think the state of Israel is probably involved in what is happening at the border, in what is happening overseas. It is definitively involved in all these wars. I mean, everywhere you look, Israel pops up. It doesn't matter if you're talking about Congo. They'll be like, "Well, look at what the Christians are being slaughtered in Congo."
