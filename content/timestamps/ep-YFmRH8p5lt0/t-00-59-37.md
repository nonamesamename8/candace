## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They would have had information. I was wondering why he was in Salt Lake City, but apparently he had an interview with Restaurantology Summit. So you can ignore that tidbit. Comments from stars saying, "Making sure I send a super chat today since the Zionists want to call you vermin for having so many supporters of truth. We love you, Candace. God bless you and your family and your whole team." Thank you so much. Jill writes, "I'm so disappointed in my pastor, Jack Hibbs. He was so close with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and yet he hasn't said nearly enough in my opinion." Well, Joe continues: "Christian Zionist loyalty to Jews and Israel seems to have replaced loyalty to God, the church, and the truth." Yeah, well, look—he's another big pastor. I can tell you about Jack Hibbs. He was one that—he was another person that PragerU was pushing to me—wanted me to interview him. I may have even interviewed him. I can't remember.
