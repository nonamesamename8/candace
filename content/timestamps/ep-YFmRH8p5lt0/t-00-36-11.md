> Okay? And maybe they were going to see if they could fix them. You know how every episode of Intervention ends. They ask you if you want to go to rehab because they love you. Okay? They read the letters. "Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I remember you. You were so brave." You were so brave, and you loved Israel, and you understood that your job is to be a good little goy and do what we say. I miss you. Do you want to go to rehab? But that phone call wasn't coming in from mom or dad. It was coming in from Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu). And that's kind of terrifying, actually.
