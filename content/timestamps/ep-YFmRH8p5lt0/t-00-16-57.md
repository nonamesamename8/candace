## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Going back to Rob McCoy and him having bad luck—this person tells me that he knew the shooter's mother, was his pastor or something. Happy to correct that. But then also got close to the victim's family, and the victim's family got upset with him. Anyways, just put that in your back pocket. I just thought that I should mention that—like he's got some luck, or bad luck rather, okay? March 27th—like I said—is when we have that trans shooting at Covenant Elementary School in Nashville. And then we go back into our timeline. You can see on April 1st, we have that plane—we're gonna call it the yellow plane for the sake of this timeline. The yellow plane flies from Cairo—always via Paris—to St. Louis again, and it lands in Missouri. And guess what?
