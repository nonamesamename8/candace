## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I just don't like it. I don't like it. The vibes don't feel right. What was going on? Why was Turning Point—you know—what was their campus doing? Why are people at Turning Point saying they don't know where the money's coming from? Why is no one seeming to be grieving him in the right way? Why does it feel to me like a hostile takeover of a company? That's how I personally feel. Okay, that's how I feel. I feel like this is a hostile takeover of a company. And I feel that the company became bigger than Charlie (Charlie Kirk) because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was too ambitious, and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) trusted people, and he trusted that people were in it for the right reasons. And what I have learned in politics is people are hardly ever in it for the right reasons, truly. If you are getting into politics, you think you're gonna meet good people—you're out of your mind.
