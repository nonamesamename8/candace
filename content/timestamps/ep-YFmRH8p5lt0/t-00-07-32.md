## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's the furthest that we can go back on FlightRadar. Now we're going to go into 2023. And I have included notes that I think might be relevant to the story. So in 2023, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—I went back on his X feed—and he is hitting hard on Ukraine. I mean, like, he's tweeting out photos of Zelensky half-naked 'cause you know, he used to be an actor. Obviously he's a homosexual male. He's basically demanding—keep this up the whole time, guys. I want them to be able to look through this. He's basically demanding that we pull out of the Ukrainian war. He's accusing Ukraine and Zelensky of corruption, of financial fraud, of money laundering.
