## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You go back, and he's just basically declared war on the Ukrainian war—figuratively speaking, okay? And he's not siding on Team Ukraine. He's not pro-Russia, but he's not... I think that's relevant, obviously, because—yeah—when you talk about money laundering around Ukraine and Romania, you're actually stepping on the heels of America, right?

January 10th to 19th—I'm going to also say that I think this is relevant. Rob McCoy hosts the first-ever Turning Point USA Faith Pastors Tour of Israel. He's guiding a group of pastors through Jerusalem.
