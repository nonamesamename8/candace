## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So I started last night, and I said, "Okay, maybe that was a coincidence. Let me actually—since I presented that timeline for you every time I came to America—see if it was always near Charlie (Charlie Kirk), or if it was always near some big Turning Point event, if something was going on with Turning Point." And the answer, you guys—if you thought once was maybe, twice was a coincidence, three times we have a conspiracy—we're at about every single time that we could go back on this plane, and we're not done, obviously. There was something happening at Turning Point USA that was neighboring, okay—in the same city. So I'm gonna take you through this timeline. This is so shocking to me. And I've color-coordinated this timeline. I'm sure there are going to be some errors.
