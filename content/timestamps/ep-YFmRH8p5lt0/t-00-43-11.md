## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You guys can let me know. But this plane flew from Scottsdale and then landed in Salt Lake City at 9:23 a.m. local time. And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) gets shot at 12:23, and this plane scrambles, and it leaves Salt Lake City and it heads to Scottsdale at one o'clock p.m. So that's pretty quick, but coming from Salt Lake City doesn't make sense to me. So I'm thinking this had somebody, but why did they go to Salt Lake City? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Okay.
