## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) rushed—raced out of the gate—to establish Charlie (Charlie Kirk) as like Israel's top goy, and he said probably too much. He said he called him two weeks ago, and he invited him to Israel. And the part that he left out was Charlie (Charlie Kirk) declined. So when he got the phone call to go to figurative rehab, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said, "No, I'm good." Actually, Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) offered to fund Turning Point to the next level. Okay. Andrew Kolvet should be able to confirm that. Yes or no. Don't dance around it. I don't like the dancing him and Alex did. "Oh, this this bowl." It's a yes. Okay. Take it to the next level with what money, though? Actually, it is relevant, and it is true that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not know where the money was coming from. That's why he established DOGE.
