## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The beauty industry was telling all of us that we needed all these complex formulas to achieve healthy skin. And obviously that's not true. The real secret is, of course, simple. That's why I love Nimi Skincare. Nimi is doing something that seems quite radical by building one of the most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth—which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils—which means that your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Nimi has two products from their tallow line that you should definitely know about. First, for your daily hydration, there's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is gonna be your go-to moisturizer. It's light; it absorbs quickly; and it does not leave you with that greasy feeling. They combine that with soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil.
