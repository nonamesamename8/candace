## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You got it. You got it. I would like to know if you are a Turning Point USA insider and you are watching this show: who started that chapter? That is very relevant to my research right now. Who started the Lincoln, Nebraska chapter? Because I can't find that. I've looked through. I've tried to see who was the first person. Typically, I think to start a charter chapter, you have to apply, so there's got to be some students. And maybe you're in Lincoln, Nebraska, and you can ask around: who said, "Hey, let's start this chapter in Lincoln, Nebraska all by ourselves. We're not going to be regional anymore"? I need to know who that is. Okay. So that happens, and then on February 14th, our plane departs back for Cairo.
