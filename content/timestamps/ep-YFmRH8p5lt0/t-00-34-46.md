## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> They are very angry. Josh Hammer is angry. Seth Dillon is angry. Far be it from them to ever tell the truth about that. These people were gonna lie. "Oh, he never blinked.

Just nine days later, it goes through Omaha, Nebraska at 11:37 a.m. It departs, and it heads over to Lincoln, Nebraska, and it stays there for six days.
