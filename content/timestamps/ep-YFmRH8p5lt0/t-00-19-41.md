## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Literally every time this plane is here, I can pin a TPUSA Faith event that's happening—which is like some luck, right? February. Now we're going now into 2024. I guess actually let's start with January. And January 3, 2024—Mikey McCoy's promoted to the chief of staff of Turning Point USA. I have the internal email, so that is a fact. He gets the promotion. Now you can see, I guess, the McCoys are much more involved in Turning Point USA. I did not know them, so this has to be the year that they got super involved because I'm gonna do my last speech for them in June of 2024. Anyways, he gets promoted to chief of staff. And then on February 8th, Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) campus tour is publicly announced. I'm doing it with him.
