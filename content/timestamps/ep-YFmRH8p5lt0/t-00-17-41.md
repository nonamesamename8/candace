## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> April 2nd, TPUSA Faith— co-chaired by Rob McCoy—kicks off their tour with an event headed by Sean Feucht in Jefferson City, Missouri the very next day while this plane is here. Okay. Let's keep going. Okay. April 6th, it leaves, and it always goes through Delaware when it leaves and goes back to Cairo. Okay. Now I am just kind of putting down for you here again other places where Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) here, where he is, because I know that I'm going to—this is going to build into my timeline. You know, I'm looking in, and Sean Feucht is in Israel related to some more Faith stuff. I don't know if Turning Point sponsors that trip or not. That's why I put a note there.
