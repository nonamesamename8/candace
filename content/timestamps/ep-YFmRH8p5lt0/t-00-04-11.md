## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> As you know, because I am relying on you guys for tips—I'm grateful that I have a platform, but I don't exist without you guys— I'm always checking the comments to see if I got something wrong, if I made a mistake, if there's something that I missed. And somebody I just happened to catch gave a live comment right after the show. I was looking at your comments, and he said, "Oh, Candace, that plane we covered, the tail number SUBTT—just so you know—like a year earlier, that plane was in Utah at the same time as Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." In 2023, I was like, "Oh, that's pretty ironic if that's true." I was like, it's probably not true—except it actually was true.
