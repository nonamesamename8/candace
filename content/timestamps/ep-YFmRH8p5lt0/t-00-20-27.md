## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> On February 9th... our plane comes in. Our Egyptian military plane comes in. This time it is headed to Nebraska, and it lands in Nebraska and then flies straight to Lincoln, Nebraska. It lands in Omaha—pardon—and then flies straight over to Lincoln, and it stays in Lincoln for a mysterious five days. Now I'm racking my brains. I couldn't find anything going on with Turning Point, but I was like, I bet there's something going on in Turning Point in Lincoln, Nebraska, because that's a pretty precise location for this plane to go to. And lo and behold, Turning Point USA on February 11th—while this is going on— starts a chapter in Lincoln, Nebraska. I'm not kidding. Here's the post. Now, to be clear—because people will go out and say, "Oh, they already had events at the University of Nebraska"—
