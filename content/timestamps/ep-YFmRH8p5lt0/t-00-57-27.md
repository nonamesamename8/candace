## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Most Americans are putting these expenses on credit cards, and the credit card rates are insane right now—in the 20s or even the 30s. American Financing can show you how to use your home's equity to pay off that debt with rates in the low fives. Their salary-based mortgage consultants are helping homeowners just like you restructure their loans and save money every month. All without any upfront fees. Their customers are saving an average of about $800 a month—which is like a $10,000 raise annually without even having to change jobs. So call American Financing today and start saving. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or you can visit americanfinancing.net/Owens. Again, that's americanfinancing.net/Owens. And of course, I always tell you about Nimi Skincare. I love them.
