## Transcript

> So let me know when you get uncomfortable and you realize this is not—these are not coincidences, okay? This is a conspiracy. This plane is following Turning Point USA Faith and Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—and/or Charlie (Charlie Kirk). By the way, at those TPUSA Faith events, it's possible Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was speaking. I just can't find it. It's very difficult to search Charlie (Charlie Kirk) right now and to go back. So I'm going to continue to build this timeline, but you're getting the picture here. Let's keep going. So yes, that plane comes in here. And then I have here on April 9th that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is in Omaha, Nebraska, speaking at the Lord of Hosts Church. So he's doing TPUSA Faith stuff in general. And then we get our blue—our blue plane comes in. Our blue plane— remember—is the one that whenever it's here, it's going to sit for a little bit.
