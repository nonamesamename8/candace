## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> But they were like, "Pastor Jack Hibbs. Pastor Jack Hibbs." And now I look at that, and I'm thinking that's part of an operation. That's likely part of an operation. All these people that they wanted me to platform: Lila Rose, Jack Hibbs, Tim Ballard. I look back on that stuff, and I'm reflecting, and I realize that—like I said—I had handlers, and they were directing me to do things. I never really questioned the things they were directing me to do until today. So Jack Hibbs was also a part of like a Turning Point USA Faith event. And I am looking at Turning Point USA Faith sideways—especially because like he doesn't even care about the allegations against Sean Feucht. And what are they doing? It doesn't matter. We're just gonna keep on continuing working with him—Rob McCoy. Alpaca Renee writes, "God bless you, Candace. You're a warrior for such a time as this.
