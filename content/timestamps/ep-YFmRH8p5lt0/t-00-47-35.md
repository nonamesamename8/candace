## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I never again covered it because, you know, feelings are not facts. But given the picture that we now have of his father and what his father is involved in—and the fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was kind of veering from what I think was a predetermined course for Turning Point USA—I have a lot of questions. Also, another person who wrote us was telling me the story about Tyler Bowyer's involvement in like Maricopa County politics in general—like what did he do before in Arizona? And yeah, it's just the kind of stories that he said. He approached him several times about embezzlement—you know, not Charlie. Tyler (Tyler Bowyer) was hooking up with young interns—young male interns or young male workers. And he didn't even care.
