## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I wanna say it leaves at seven o'clock in the morning. Oh no, that's the other tail number—just kidding—the G5 plane. Okay, switch that. This is why he needs to bring this in. Tail number N102DZ. We'll have it up in a second. N102DZ—we're interested in because at 7:12 a.m. in the morning in Scottsdale—so that's local time in Scottsdale—it flies from Scottsdale to Salt Lake City. So instantly I was like, "Oh, this could be Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) plane." But then like, why would Charlie (Charlie Kirk) fly into Salt Lake City? No, he would fly into Provo, obviously, because Salt Lake City is like 60 miles away. You don't fly private so that you can then take a 60-mile car unless there's some reason that you would have to—like the airport was closed. And I don't think that's true. Maybe it is.
