## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, we are gonna take a break here quickly, and then we'll be right back. All right, you guys. I'm going to take a brief pause here to tell you guys about PreBorn. You guys know that I love them and the work that they are doing because I think we all recognize in this moment that silence is not kindness. Silence is consent. And right now, the greatest silence is surrounding the topic of abortion—the lives that are lost before they are even allowed to take their first breath. Going to call ourselves defenders of life, we should act like it. That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love. For just $28—that's what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion. Just $28 helps her to see the life that's growing inside of her—gives her the truth that our culture does not. So you shouldn't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. You can be bold. You can be clear.
