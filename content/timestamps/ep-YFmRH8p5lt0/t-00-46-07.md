## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You can grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company. If you wake up with a sore throat or a runny nose, you can address those symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit that contains ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, a generic Z-pack, and there's a lot more in there too. It's like having an urgent care clinic in your own home. You can use that Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company. And I do it simply because I refuse to be trapped in line at the emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance for catching a simple cold. You can just open the kit when you get it, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and you can get right back to life. The kit is literally a lifesaver with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So head to twc.health/Candace today and use code CANDACE, and you'll save $48.
