## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> What's going on here? We then know that three days later—bringing that back up—on September 13th, our blue plane—which trails—is going to leave through Canada, as it always does. It's going to leave Provo. That's going to go through Canada, through Paris, and back home to Cairo— three days following Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Did that plane perhaps have the rest of the people that were left behind? What is going on? I wanna know. One more thing that I want to mention to you—and Skylar, I actually didn't tell you.
