## Transcript

> You can be unapologetically pro-life by heading to preborn.org/Candace right now. Give $28. You can even give 10 times that if you'd like to. This is the line that we should all hold, and it's time to stand on it—standing for truth and what is right by saving lives from abortion and standing firm in the gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace. Provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also want to tell you guys about The Wellness Company because it is officially cold and flu season, which means that it's also flu shot season. And after everything that we have been through over the last five years, the number of people that are actually getting the flu shot is at a record low. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective—whatever that means. And that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries, of course. There is a much better way to stay healthy.
