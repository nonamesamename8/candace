## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I was like, "This lie will not stand." And he's telling Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to go hard in the paint. Now, I know for a fact that when Tucker (Tucker Carlson) came off stage, one donor immediately—a woman who I have not named yet—instantly started yelling at Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) then gets the full donor squeeze. "You are not allowed to be anti-Israel." This feels like a good time to mention that the last time that I spoke at Turning Point USA's conference in 2024, there was this random sidebar conversation that I had with Tyler Bowyer. Tyler Bowyer is the king of shady at Turning Point USA. He is the one—like I said—that has—he has hired every person around Charlie (Charlie Kirk).
