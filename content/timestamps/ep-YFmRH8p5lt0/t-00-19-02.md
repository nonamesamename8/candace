## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I don't know, but I'm putting it in there because once again, we have this plane in here, and we've got another TPUSA Faith event that is happening right around the corner. It's about—I think—just under two hours to get from Wichita, Kansas to Topeka where the TPUSA Faith Kingdom to the Capitol Tour continues. Okay. April 3rd, BND is in here doing—it does a test flight. I think I might've dropped this blue thing. Oh yeah, it's been here the whole time. That's right. This plane stays here a long time. So it's been here from February 21st, and then it's going to head out, and it just leaves on May 9th, okay? That's gonna end 2023.
