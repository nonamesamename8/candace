## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at that is speaking in Sacramento on April 13th. Yellow plane again comes in. This time it flies to Kansas. Cairo to Kansas. And on April 23rd, Sean Feucht heads up the TPUSA Faith Kingdom to the Capitol Tour event, which happens to be in Topeka, Kansas. So I have a question. When did—how did he get here from Israel? Did he fly into Wichita the day before and then make the very short drive to make his event?
