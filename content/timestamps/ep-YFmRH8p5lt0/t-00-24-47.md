## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's the University of Utah at Salt Lake City. I think that's correct. So he is doing an event at Salt Lake—at the University of Utah. It's a "Prove Me Wrong" event. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is here, of course. And then we have that BTT— that's our yellow plane—departs on April 28th. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) event is over, so we can move on. Also have here that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) spoke in North Dakota, so he's in the area. And then on July 17th, our blue plane is going to leave, right? It always lags behind our yellow plane. Now let's get into 2024. This is the year that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) gets assassinated, right? I don't know what this plane is doing. I don't know who's on the plane.
