## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Right—33 hours. Wink wink. Freemasons. Wink wink wink. Oh, Tyler Robinson's file adds up to 33. Oh, the Freemason lodge in St. George or in Utah is number 33. It's like we get it, okay? This was an assassination at a very high level, and they do communicate with numerology. And this—if this sounds above your head—it's probably because you're not in my book club. But it is just to me the most sinister and sickening thing that these people can lay their heads on the pillow at night, and they were just going to keep going. Okay. I feel a lot is adding up, and that more people need to look into Turning Point Faith. They need to look into NAR. Again, I would follow Village Crazy Lady on X. She's fantastic at research, and she has been keeping them on their toes with research. And that is the area that she wants to go down. I can only chase so many rabbits.
