## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> But to stay on this Sean Feucht thing—I had to actually look him up, and I saw it on his biography and on Wikipedia, by the way. So this is—I haven't done a deep dive on him by any means—but I was like, I recognize that name. And I recognize that name because many people emailed us after Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination, and they thought Sean Feucht was the guy that was standing and cheering "USA! USA!" And I think he did a video and denied it. But that's the only familiarity—like the only way that I was familiar with that name. So look him up on his biography. And it tells us that he was born in Montana. He's a son of a dermatologist. That dermatologist is not named. He's, of course, a Christian Zionist, you guys—that's obvious.
