## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, that could be a coincidence, but MG+M has many employees that are either fluent in French or are connected to France altogether. The FBI apparently has Suite 300 and MG+M has Suite 200, which I believe is exactly right below where the FBI says that they are. OK, now he gets back into the crane location, right? Because there seems to be no public record of what the actual construction project is that is happening online, except for the fact that apparently a global biopharmaceutical company called Incyte owns it, okay?

## Claims Made

- [factual] a global biopharmaceutical company called Incyte owns it. On May 2024, they say that construction is expected to take about a year
  - *Follow-up:* Verify company statements
