## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> There are five different Nemours Children Hospital centers nearby. Yes, they perform transgender surgeries or yes, they do transgender, rather. Nemours Children's Hospitals are named for Nemours, France, the home of the du Pont family. Hotel du Pont is obviously walking distance from 920 King. First and Central Presbyterian Church is an LGBTQ church that is across from that hotel. Cab Calloway School is a short 10-minute drive and this is where our transgender congressman McBride graduated from. Theatre N is a five-minute walk. They feature transgender productions with a drag show at least every month. The Queen is an eight-minute walk.
