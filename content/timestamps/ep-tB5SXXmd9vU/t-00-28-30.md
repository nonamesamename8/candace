## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That crane is situated on 1100 North King Street. Let's bring up the map here so you can see what's going on here, okay? What I found on 1100, 1100 North King Street is big. The actual building is called the Bracebridge Complex. It spans over 1 million square feet. It seems it was originally built for the Maryland Bank as their bank headquarters from 1995 until 2006, when Bank of America acquired it. In 2018—remember, that's going to be the year that Macron comes to power—Bank of America pulled out of a few of the buildings and they left it completely empty.
