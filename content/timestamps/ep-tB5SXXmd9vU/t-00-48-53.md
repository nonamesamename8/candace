## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> First and foremost, nothing he is saying is true. The first thing I'd like to clarify is I have never been friends with Steven Crowder. I just feel like that is a really not-good dirt to throw on my name. I just have better intuition than that. Secondly, my friend Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) just got shot in the neck, hence the reason we're doing this entire podcast investigation into what actually happened on that day. Now, you seem to be naming employers. Regarding The Daily Wire, I am still friends with every single one of my colleagues that I was friends with when I went in there. And yeah, when you leave a job, you don't tend to hang out with management on your way out. So I'm not sure what you're referencing here.
