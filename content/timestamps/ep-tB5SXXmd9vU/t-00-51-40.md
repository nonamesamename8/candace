## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We are not going to save the West in general from the absolute sexual deviants that run it, the liars and the crooks that run the West, if we have the attitude that we need to be well liked by famous people who are all drunk, truly, they're all just a bunch of drunks hanging out in DC. That's the reality of the political fields. Get real value in your life. And that's what I want to say about that before I get into some of your questions. Poll is still running, by the way. I will tell you the total when we come back from this brief break. All right, you guys, I want to remind you about PureTalk. In all the time that I have been endorsing my wireless company, PureTalk, I've never seen an offer like this. Right now you can get unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited data with a 30 gig hotspot for just $29.95 a month for life.
