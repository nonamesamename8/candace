## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The larger story here being, hey, the French Legionnaires might have been on the ground during Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination. So what happened is the Ministry, the Minister of the Armed Forces issued the following statement in France, and I'm going to quote this for you: "Tyler Robinson was never part of the French Foreign Legion. If he did not serve in an American military unit, he could not have trained with the French Foreign Legion," end quote. That's quite a way to dance around things. And Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) says, I see what you did there. You just missed the fact that we don't think Tyler Robinson did. So you're just issuing a statement. This is bogus.
