**Candace Owens:**

How can I start a global conversation about me? And then I came up with this idea of creating fan fiction, where I imagined myself as the victim of a multinational state plot to murder me.

We're gonna move quickly through a lot of things this week because everyone in the world needs to wake up to how things actually work.
