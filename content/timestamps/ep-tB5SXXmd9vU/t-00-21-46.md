## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> that after that civilian-military exercise ended at Camp Ripley on the 27th, another joint military operation began from August 29th through to September 10th, the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot. And that was known as Operation Bright Star, and that took place in Cairo, Egypt. Now, it is a biannual joint military operation. It's co-hosted by the United States and Egypt to enhance regional security and to strengthen military partnerships. I just don't love the timing of all of these things. I just don't love France and Egypt and the United States together for the whole month leading up to the assassination of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk).
