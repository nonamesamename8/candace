## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I think that it's kind of a funny story that will one day be in my autobiography. Truly, that was my thought. Like, it's funny that we're on the phone talking about, like, the French—why is he married to somebody born a male? And I clearly was not thinking that there was maybe sort of an implicit threat involved here, like literally just stop speaking about her. And I really do wish, going back, that they had tried honesty, right? They had said, hey, Brigitte might be an asset to the Mossad, which is what we had received a tip regarding, that we were working on confirming during Becoming Brigitte season two. I wish they had been more explicit and said, we really actually need you to shut up about this forever.
