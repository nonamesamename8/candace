## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's a pretty busy season everywhere. We're talking early September. It's back to school. There's a lot going on. And I was very comforted to see that Brigitte Macron had opened Paris Design Week. Makes sense, right? Opened Paris Design Week on, I believe, September 4th. Very public. Gets photographed with the culture—the Ministry of Culture lady, right? The head of their Ministry of Culture, an actual lady. And then Brigitte Macron gets photographed on 9/4 with Zelensky.
