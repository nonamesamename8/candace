## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like I said, I sense an urgency right now. They are being so evil in our faces. They chose to publicly execute Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and then to dare us to question the narrative. That's scary. That is—that it's meant to scare you and to instill fear in you. And the response to this, of course, has to be more truth. We cannot be fearful. We have to keep telling the truth. Fegliano writes, "These elites are horror-show cruel. I am understanding in a way that I didn't before why people believe in God. In the face of this, it provides meaning and comfort available from little else. Shame on officials everywhere who disregard morality, especially the powerful ones. Also, Nick, stop being so ignorant. It's annoying." Genevieve writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), you are my personal hero.
