## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> This is PureTalk's top tier plan, which is normally $65 a month. Right now through December 7th, you can get all of this for just $29.95 a month. You're saving over 50% a month, every month, for life, and it's all on their crazy fast 5G network. But this offer is extremely short-lived, of course, so do not wait. Go to puretalk.com/Owens for PureTalk's best unlimited plan for just $29.95 a month for life. Make the switch in as little as 10 minutes. You can keep your phone, keep your number, and you can start saving with their unlimited plan for life. Again, that's puretalk.com/ Owens to switch to my wireless company, which is PureTalk. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing, because what if you could delay your next two mortgage payments?
