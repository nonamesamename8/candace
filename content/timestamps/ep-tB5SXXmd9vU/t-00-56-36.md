## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He tried to corner me and he found out. If she wants to talk, I'll call her. If not, no worries. I've lost too many people in my life to get too emotional about these things. I've always respected CO. That moment got blown out of proportion. Anyway, I remain." And my message back was, keep that same energy. You went onto a podcast, you lied about a relationship with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) right after he died. And I was still reeling from so many emotions. I was then being attacked and lied about a very real relationship that I had in my life. And you're just gonna privately email this little sucker apology. Keep the same energy. Do it publicly. Say I lied or I misspoke, whichever it is. He's not done that. He's not moved to do that. I don't believe he did. At least it wasn't sent to us.
