## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Where was Brigitte Macron on the dates that that Egyptian plane was—from 9/4 through to 9/11? Where was Brigitte Macron? I would just like to know, I need to know where Brigitte Macron was and I need, I think, an answer to that question—it is due. I would just—it would just comfort me to know. So I'm asking you guys for help determining the answer to that. I could go on, by the way—Wilmington, Delaware also being the hub for MKUltra is especially sweet. The email that we got, that it's also the hub for transgenderism in America—like, who knew that? I certainly didn't. Our first ever trans congressman, you guys—guess where?
