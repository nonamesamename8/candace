## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Of course, they send out the people on Twitter who get to come out and say, oh, I think she's crazy. I think she's making it up. They do this. We are always doing this every week. Oh, Trump (Donald Trump) never called her about Brigitte Macron. She's making that up for attention. Oh, she's lying. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never changes his mind about Israel. She's making that up for attention. This is what we do every week, right? We're hamsters on a wheel. And so we're back to that again, right? People saying that I made it up. But what did the French couple do? That's what matters. It's now been a full week since I made that announcement. And here is the official response issued by the Élysée Palace. Nothing. Nothing.
