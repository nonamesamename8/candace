## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> Disgusting. Forget about what she said about Israel and Jews and BLM and liberals. This is friendship stuff. This is friendship stuff. The most valuable currency you have are the relationships you have with your friends. In my opinion, she's burned every bridge she's ever been associated with. Whether that's Turning Point USA, whether that's The Daily Wire, whether that's PragerU, Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), Steven Crowder. I don't know what's going on even in this room, but it's not like we're loving what she's doing these days. I'm asking you a serious question. Who are her friends at this point? To me, she's very lonely. No, I think she's very close with Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I do think she has a group of friends. How many more can you name, though? Other than Tucker, genuine question. I'm not trying to throw her under the bus.
