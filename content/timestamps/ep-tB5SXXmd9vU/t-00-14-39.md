## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I will say I didn't go through an official channel and send an email, and I should do that, but I did send a text message to somebody very high up who received the text message. No response. Now, I thought that the claim of the French Foreign Legion being involved in Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination, I thought the FBI might be interested. No, no phone calls even from Utah's FBI branch have come into me either. What did you want to see? Aren't we supposed to be investigating the Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) assassination? It was totally not a state operation. And they really want to get to the truth, which explains why nobody called. No Utah, not interested. I'm actually surprised Tyler Robinson's lawyer hasn't reached out to me.
