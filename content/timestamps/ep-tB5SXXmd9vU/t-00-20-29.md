## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The exercise, announced on the Ministry's website and the regiment's Facebook page, was not a clandestine operation. The Ministry of the Armed Forces formally denies that another Foreign Legion training exercise took place at a supposed Camp Riley in Minnesota after the conclusion of the California exercise, and for good reason, because no Camp Riley exists in Minnesota," as Andy Parish, the former chief of staff to the Republican state representative, pointed out on X. "Oh, there is, however, a Camp Ripley," they go on, "but this inaccuracy speaks volumes about the credibility of Candace Owens' alleged source."
