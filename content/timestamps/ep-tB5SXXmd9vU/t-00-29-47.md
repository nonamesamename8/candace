## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Pierre S. du Pont was a member of the French-American family du Pont, which was descended from Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours—excuse my terrible French—a French aristocrat. DuPont also has extreme ties to both the American and the French military. Obviously, we know that, as they are the original manufacturers of Kevlar, which has been historically regarded as the greatest way to make bulletproof armor. So now we have this prominent French family connected to this building. I think you're right to keep looking at French. People even shared concerns about what was actually happening at that building. There was a resident named Miriam Deeds who said, quote, 'I just feel like I don't understand why we're doing this without there being more accountability.'"
