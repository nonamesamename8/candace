## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Based on over 100 studies, we now know that C15 strengthens our cells and it's a key healthy-aging nutrient, which helps slow biological aging at the cellular level. When our cells do not have enough of C15, they become fragile and they age faster. Thankfully, Fatty15 repairs age-related damage to cells, protects them from future breakdown, and activates pathways in the body that help regulate our sleep, our cognitive health, and natural repair mechanisms. Fatty15 is science-backed, it's award-winning, it's patented, 100% pure C15 supplement. It's free of flavors, allergens, preservatives, and it's also vegan-friendly. Fatty15 has three times more cellular benefits than Omega-3 or fish oil. It comes in gorgeous reusable glass bamboo jars, and refills are shipped directly to your front door.
