## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> They are advertising Disney drag brunches. Twenty minutes back toward the airport, you will find a multitude of plastic surgeons. And then they list them. Wilmington University is nearby where they offer LGBTQ programs for kids, and Transition Delaware LLC, which offers counseling, etc., has two locations, and then they list them. So it's a lot of transgenderism happening in that area, which is of interest to me. I just started a poll, by the way. We are live on YouTube. I asked a very simple question.
