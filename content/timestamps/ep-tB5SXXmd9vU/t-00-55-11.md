## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> But we had kind of gotten sidetracked on Becoming Brigitte, and we should maybe get back involved in it. Anyways, getting into the top comment from the last episode—and Skylar, just let me know when you have that email ready. This was: "How did" from knit unravel wrote, "How did Andrew Kolvet know that it was supposed to be Candace if the killer is Tyler Robinson?" That was actually something that I had never considered. I told you guys that Andrew Kolvet called me from the hospital and basically said you and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) should shut up because you guys are on a list. What list? Nobody mentioned that Tyler Robinson had a list. And certainly, if he's killing over the topic of transgenderism, I don't think me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) would be high on it. So yeah, what are we speaking about?
