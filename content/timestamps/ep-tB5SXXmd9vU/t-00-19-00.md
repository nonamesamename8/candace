## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Tyler Robinson never trained in the French Foreign Legion. Do you mind answering yes or no: If anybody who trained with the French Foreign Legion was on the ground on September 10th at Utah Valley University? And we are asking that explicit question because one of the strangest things is that the UVU students who attended said that they felt like they didn't recognize anybody that was there. It was weird. It was very strange that they advertised for this event really late in the day. And then suddenly we see a bunch of adults and people that they don't recognize at this event. And then afterwards the national media moves to—it looks like they're almost trying not to interview any UVU students. Right?
