## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> No, and by the way, on the subject of who the kind of people that he's referring to, it was notoriously Eric Bolling that sat across from Adam when they attacked me over Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) and lied and said that I hadn't been friends with Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) since 2017. After that episode, Eric Bolling sent me an email and apologized and said it was Adam's fault. He didn't even know Adam's name. I think he called him Sam in the email. I should actually pull it and I'll post it on Instagram—didn't even know—threw Adam's and PBD's entire team under the bus in three seconds, and said, I just want to apologize with you, Candace (Candace Owens), because that's how politics work. They all stab each other in the back, and they all do it because they think they're on the pursuit of, like, fame and riches.
