## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Ripley, and that ran just for a couple of days until August 27th, and that was known as Operation Valhalla, okay? Random three-day exercise with civilians. And I was wondering if the French Legionnaires that were in California maybe jumped right into activities going on with these civilians at Camp Ripley. But I typo'd on X and I wrote Camp Riley, okay? So I wrote, it's not a coincidence that the French Legionnaires were in the United States training with our Marines for three weeks. And when those three weeks ended in California, another military training exercise began alongside civilians at Camp Riley in Minnesota—should have said Ripley.
