## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

What is this never-before-seen lawsuit? It is a consequence from The Matrix for me discussing a multinational state secret, which is Brigitte Macron. Brigitte Macron's true origins, what Brigitte Macron was involved in in the United States while living as Jean-Michel Trogneux.
