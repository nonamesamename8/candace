## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Oh, now it's about to cross 25,000 people voted. 93% of you say yes. Okay, just making sure that you're all having the same gut instinct as me of why the heck did they sue in Delaware? What is this never-before-seen lawsuit? It is a consequence from The Matrix for me discussing a multinational state secret, which is Brigitte Macron. Brigitte Macron's true origins, what Brigitte Macron was involved in in the United States while living as Jean-Michel Trogneux. And by the way, I think there's another identity in between there that happens potentially in the 80s for Brigitte, before he emerges as a woman. And I think it's quite dark, whatever that secret is, to be honest with you.
