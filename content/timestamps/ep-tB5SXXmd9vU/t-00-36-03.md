## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I probably would have done it if they were just honest and said, it's a national security issue. But instead they went with Emmanuel Macron's feelings are hurt, which I thought was LOL funny and obviously wanted to continue to speak about this. I don't even know what to make of this other than—and you can tell me if you agree— I feel like I was set up by the federal government in terms of this lawsuit. Like this wasn't just Brigitte and Emmanuel sitting down making a mistake
