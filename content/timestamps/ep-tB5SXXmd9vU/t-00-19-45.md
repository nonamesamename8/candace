## Transcript

Yes or no? That seems tricky when it comes to the French government. Yes-or-no questions are not their thing. Elsewhere in the article, and this is France 24 that reported this, it tells us that, quote, "The Ministry of the Armed Forces confirms that a training exercise by the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment, a unit of the French Foreign Legion, did indeed take place in California from August 2nd to the 25th, as reported by Candace Owens.
