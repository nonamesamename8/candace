## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They're interviewing everybody around. You've got all these adults who were there. But mysteriously, the UVU students who had some interesting tidbits about what was weird that day just don't flood into the mainstream like we expected them to. Can you answer that question? Yes or no? That seems tricky when it comes to the French government. Yes-or-no questions are not their thing. Elsewhere in the article, and this is France 24 that reported this, it tells us that, quote, "The Ministry of the Armed Forces confirms that a training exercise by the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment, a unit of the French Foreign Legion, did indeed take place in California from August 2nd to the 25th, as reported by Candace Owens.
