## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> In the 1790s, a large cluster of French-speaking refugees, many of which were fleeing Haiti and the French Revolutions, settled along it, and the nickname French Street took over. This street ran all the way from the Christina River up through town and became a main hub for travel and business. Wilmington is more French than people would initially assume, and it's easy to see this once you look at its history. The North tag of North French Street is a later addressing convention for blocks north of downtown." So that's just to back up there, okay? Now, again, we're gonna have to go through this class very quickly. America, the whole idea of what we learn in class about, you know, the Revolutionary War, and we were fighting because, oh, we didn't—you know, the monarchy, okay.
