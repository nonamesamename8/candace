## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You think I'm just doing that because I'm assuming you could get a felony for making something up out of thin air like that. You can't just use United States resources to go after somebody in a plot that never existed that you did for clicks on YouTube. So what's the issue here? Why is no one coming out and telling you that that's completely baseless, especially the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination? The whole world is invested in that assassination. Wouldn't you want to shut that down? The idea that it was a multi-nationally planned event. And by the way, is that on its face even plausible? Multiple agencies and multiple countries involved from Egypt to Israel. People are saying that's totally crazy.
