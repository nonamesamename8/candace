## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay. So to pull this all together, we have an entire French Street that is connected to 920 North King Street; the aircraft hangar and its company Satis, which is French-aligned, connected to 920 North King Street; DuPont, the French-aligned, connected to 1100 North King Street; the biopharmaceutical company Incyte, which is also French-aligned, connected to 1100 North King Street; DuPont, which is connected to 1100 North Market Street. And then we have 1100 North King Street itself, which is connected to 920 North King Street. And we have my lawyers and we have Brigitte's lawyers. I am not loving this. Okay. I'm just not loving the fact that I get a call from the federal government asking me to stop speaking about Brigitte.
