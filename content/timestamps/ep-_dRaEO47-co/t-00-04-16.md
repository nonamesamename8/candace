## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I can't tell you how many times we looked at each other and we said, “We can outwork them.” Everyone was bigger than us, but not working harder than us. That came really directly from Charlie (Charlie Kirk). It was the thing that he said we could always control. And I totally agreed with that. Work ethic meant everything. I think it's very obvious to everyone. I was the culture. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was the politics. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) needed a little bit more culture. I needed to learn the rules of politics. I mean, he could tell you every office in the White House and what this person does, things I'd never even heard before. I was just passionate about Black Lives Matter. I knew it was going to be harmful for Black Americans, and I wanted to share that message.
