## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It was in the middle of Chicago O'Hare airport. There is this restaurant that's called the Macaroni Grill. And I sat down with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on our first trip together. He flips over this little paper menu as we're waiting for our flight, and he takes out this pen, and he just starts drawing a map of what he wants to happen into the future, what the Turning Point organization will become. It was spastic. It was unhinged. It was the absolute best. It was true Charlie (Charlie Kirk). He was a visionary. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a visionary. If he could envision it, it was going to happen. He knew that. I knew that. And what he had envisioned was for Turning Point USA to become the biggest conservative student organization—not just in the nation, by the way, but in the world.
