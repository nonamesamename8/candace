## Transcript

So you can only imagine when just a couple of months later, we've been listening to Kanye's old albums on repeat, suddenly Kanye West tweets, “I love the way Candace (Candace Owens) thinks.” The excitement, okay? We were certain that we had manifested it. 100% we manifested this by listening to “Power” on repeat.
