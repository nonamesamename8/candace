## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And he just loved it. Kanye's (Kanye West) "Power" kind of became our theme song for the tour. I have no idea why, but that was our hype song before we went on stage. So you can only imagine when just a couple of months later, we've been listening to Kanye's old albums on repeat, suddenly Kanye West tweets, “I love the way Candace (Candace Owens) thinks.” The excitement, okay? We were certain that we had manifested it. 100% we manifested this by listening to “Power” on repeat. Actually, I found a clip of us backstage on that day when that tweet happened, and we were doing what I used to refer to as like the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) dance. Here it is. [Following clip attributed to Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk.]
