## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I remember Charlie (Charlie Kirk) gets in the car, and he looks at the message, and he looks at me, and he knows I've looked at the message. I saw him. Like, “Charlie (Charlie Kirk),” I said, “I have no idea—like—where this is going. Obviously, I understand the sensible you doesn't want to lose this person on the ticket, that this means a lot to you and you've worked hard on it, but you're going to have to learn that you have to make the right decision and not the easy decision. And this is only going to work if we keep making the right decisions, you know?” And I could just see the struggle within him. And then he just—he did the right thing. He said, “Okay, if they don't want to do this event with this newbie, Candace (Candace Owens), then we're not going to do the event. And Candace (Candace Owens) and I will do it alone.” And we did.
