## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And we spent so much time practicing debating and really thinking through what our ideas were. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never missed a meeting that he had. He wouldn't do that. He took that very seriously. It doesn't matter what the circumstance was—even if it was a hurricane. And one day there was literally a hurricane. I think we were in North Carolina, South Carolina at the time. I don't remember, but all the flights got canceled, and we needed to be in D.C. by morning. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) looks at me, he's like, “We got to rent a car. We got to drive eight hours.” Totally insane. And one of the most fun road trips I've had in my life. Every single song was sung.
