## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> But I know that we will carry the torch. I will never allow the memory of Charlie to be forgotten, obviously, because there is no Candace without Charlie. You know, we came up in politics together. And so I don't know what else to say, guys, other than... a lot of pain right now, and I love you, Charlie, and, you know, I'll see you when I see you. I love you very much. Thank you, guys.
