## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I would never—there's not a single person in the world that I would wish that on. And least of all someone with a heart like Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s. He loved his family, he loved his wife, he loved his country. He didn't deserve that ending. You know, he was really young. But I know that we will carry the torch. I will never allow the memory of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to be forgotten, obviously, because there is no Candace (Candace Owens) without Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You know, we came up in politics together. And so I don't know what else to say, guys, other than... a lot of pain right now, and I love you, Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and, you know, I'll see you when I see you.
