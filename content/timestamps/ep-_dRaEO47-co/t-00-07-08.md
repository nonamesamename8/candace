And when you're in that capacity with someone, two years straight, just traveling nonstop, you really get to know them. You really see them in every condition. You start bickering like an old married couple. “Charlie (Charlie Kirk), this is not how you pack a suitcase,” I’d say to him. “You can't just put your dirty running shoes on top of your clean shirts, okay?
