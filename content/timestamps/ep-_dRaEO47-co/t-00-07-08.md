## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We went—we went at it alone. Actually, I think for that particular event, Dave Rubin (Dave Rubin) hopped on, and the rest was future. For two years straight, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I flew around the world together. On very little sleep, we were always exhausted. I'm not kidding. We took hundreds of flights together. We slept in the crappiest hotel rooms. I mean, walls so paper thin you just hear everything. And when you're in that capacity with someone, two years straight, just traveling nonstop, you really get to know them. You really see them in every condition. You start bickering like an old married couple. “Charlie (Charlie Kirk), this is not how you pack a suitcase,” I’d say to him. “You can't just put your dirty running shoes on top of your clean shirts, okay? You just can't do that.
