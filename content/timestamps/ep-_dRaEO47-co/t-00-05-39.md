Because like I said, people were not going to buy tickets to hear me and Charlie Kirk speak. And he had someone that they definitely would hear speak. And for whatever reason—and this was just my luck—Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was pumping gas. He was inside of the gas station. And I'm sitting in the car, and I see this person. His phone is sitting in the car, and the messages are lighting up on the screen and this individual is saying, “I don't want to do this event with that new girl you hired. Like, I don't want to share the stage with her, essentially. I mean, just mean-spirited, no reason. I'm bigger than her. I should do this by myself. And then if she wants to come on and be an auxiliary, that's fine. I don't want to share the stage with her, this newbie.”
