## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And as I was saying, I was having this discussion with George this morning, obviously through a lot of tears, about not wanting Charlie's caricature to survive when the actual Charlie Kirk—the individual who Charlie Kirk actually is—is so much more important. The caricature of the cartoon is that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is this young, smart guy, made a career out of debating college kids, decided not to go to college, started Turning Point USA. And I think a lot of people thought that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) must take himself a bit too seriously. And I want you guys to know that that could not be further from the truth. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and me were always laughing. Yes, he was ambitious. Everybody knows Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s ambitious.
