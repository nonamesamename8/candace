## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s rule was never say no to Fox News. So even if the show was at 4 a.m. in the morning, crack of dawn, I cannot tell you guys how many hits we did on Fox News. I'm talking four hits a day, up at 4 a.m. for Fox & Friends First and then doing whatever the evening program was, because he believed this is the way that we're going to get our names out there. You know, we have to work harder. My rule was like, we shouldn't drink. Everybody in politics is drinking. They're drunk all the time. If we're passionate, we have to understand that it's a disadvantage. People are always made weaker. It doesn't make anybody stronger to be drunk after an event. And so we didn't drink. And we had a motto, a couple of mottos, but Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s was, “We can always outwork our opponents.”
