## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

I got to tell you, initially Charlie (Charlie Kirk), ever the analytical mind, when I told him, I'm like, “I think I'm going to marry this guy,” first, he's like, “Wait, wait, wait, like, is this going to be good for your brand?” “But Charlie (Charlie Kirk), this is love. This is not a brand decision.” And then he sat down and he spent just one evening with George, and he—Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—was just the most supportive of everything. And this is our text chain—speaking about that moment. He's like, “His heart is wonderful. You guys are meant for each other. I see it brilliantly and clearly. And he gets it. He isn't afraid of you being you. And he's been through hell.” And it was—yeah, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was by my side the day that I got married, of course.
