## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He kind of scrawled and scribbled, and wrote that his structure is currently a 501(c)(3), and he's sitting there talking to me: “But here's what we can do in the future, and here's how, and then I'm going to probably take control of the RNC.” I mean, he's 23 years old, right? And he's talking, speaking to me about how he's going to... take over the RNC. The person that he adored the most—like, really, never in a million years did he think that he was going to meet him, and of course he did—was Rush Limbaugh. He was really raised on Rush Limbaugh, listening to Rush Limbaugh day in and day out, and he told me through many conversations that if he could have a show like Rush Limbaugh one day, he would be very happy. That was, I think, his ultimate goal, and it happened. We had a bunch of rules.
