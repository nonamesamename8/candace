## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> One of the best moments that I can think of, and there are so many to choose from, was we were driving through Colorado, and I put on a Kanye song, you know, on my playlist, and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) goes, “Is this Jay-Z?” I almost made him pull over the vehicle. I was like, “Are you kidding me? Okay, I understand that you don't do culture, but like, come on, you don't know the difference between Jay-Z and Kanye?” And he didn't, and I explained to him the difference. I was like, “Okay, you got to get into some Kanye West music.” Next thing you know, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s really getting into some Kanye West music. He's running 10 miles a day. He got really into running, and he's texting me about how great it is. Like, there's this text, Charlie (Charlie Kirk), he's like, “Yes, it's my new favorite song.”
