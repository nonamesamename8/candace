## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> But I don't want today to be about anything other than you guys knowing that Charlie really was an amazing person. You know, he was like... we were really close, and he was, he was my best friend and my brother, and I will never unsee the footage of what I saw, the violence of it. I pray for the people who took any pleasure in that. I would never, there's not a single person in the world that I would wish that on. And least of all someone with a heart like Charlie's. He loved his family, he loved his wife, he loved his country. He didn't deserve that ending. You know, he was really young.
