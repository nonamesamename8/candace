This is not a full meal.” Back, forth. “Charlie (Charlie Kirk), you got to buy yourself some suits that fit.” That conversation—I was like, “Charlie (Charlie Kirk), okay, I get it. You're like boy wonder; you got to buy some suits that fit.” I wasn't the only one that was hammering him on that. It was also Don Jr. (Donald Trump Jr.) and eventually him.

We know that you're very aware that your salary comes from donors.” He always wanted to be a really good steward of their capital. But eventually, Don (Donald Trump Jr.) and Eric (Eric Trump) got him a gift certificate—I think it was for his birthday—to a fancy suit place to go get fitted. And the rest is future, right?
