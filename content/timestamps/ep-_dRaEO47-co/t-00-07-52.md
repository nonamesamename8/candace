## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Charlie (Charlie Kirk), you need to eat something, okay? You're running on fumes; you got to eat something. This is not a full meal.” Back, forth. “Charlie (Charlie Kirk), you got to buy yourself some suits that fit.” That conversation—I was like, “Charlie (Charlie Kirk), okay, I get it. You're like boy wonder; you got to buy some suits that fit.” I wasn't the only one that was hammering him on that. It was also Don Jr. and eventually him. And I think it was actually him and Eric. They were like, “You know, Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I know you're very frugal. We know that you're very aware that your salary comes from donors.” He always wanted to be a really good steward of their capital. But eventually, Don and Eric got him a gift certificate—I think it was for his birthday—to a fancy suit place to go get fitted. And the rest is future, right?
