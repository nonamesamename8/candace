## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I mean, all 50 states, Canada, down to the border, the United Kingdom, Israel—you name it, we were there. And there was always a new t-shirt to print out: "Justice for Brett Kavanaugh (Brett Kavanaugh)," he sends to me. “How's this one?” I love it. We just loved the t-shirts. That was the thing.
