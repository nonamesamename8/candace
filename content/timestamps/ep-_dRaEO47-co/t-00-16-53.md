## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Looking back at too many photos, I just have too many photos of Charlie. It really is incredible to see how many times he's just right behind my back. Charlie always had my back, and I always had his. Charlie was right by my side when I started Blexit, obviously. He was also there the night that I met my husband, which was absolutely an incredible night. And in the UK, which I didn't expect to happen. I got to tell you, initially Charlie, ever the analytical mind, when I told him, I'm like, “I think I'm going to marry this guy,” first he's like, “Wait, wait, wait, like, is this going to be good for your brand?” “But Charlie, this is love. This is not a brand decision.”
