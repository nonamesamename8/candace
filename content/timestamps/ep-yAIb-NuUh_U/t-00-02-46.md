## Transcript

**Frank Turek:**
> It's okay to suggest, "Well, maybe this, maybe that," but as soon as you start launching accusations—TPUSA betrayed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I had a dream that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) told me this. That's not evidence. I mean, maybe she's right. It could be. Anything's possible, but not everything has evidence behind it, and what people don't seem to understand is why I had my friend Detective J. Warner Wallace on my podcast two weeks after Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s martyrdom.
