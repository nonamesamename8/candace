## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's what I wanna know. I just wanna know who were his actual friends and his allies because somehow too many of them are trying to criminalize asking any questions. Don't just ask questions; just accept the fed slop. It seems a little bit ridiculous. We should start, by the way, with Frank Turek. Frank Turek, as a reminder, he is the pastor friend who was next to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Actually, when he was assassinated, you remember, he was wearing the white hat. He ducks down. He is one of the people that helped to get Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to the vehicle. He was at the hospital. Well, I just learned that Frank Turek was reacting to me. He went on CBN News recently, and here is what he had to say. (clip of Frank Turek)
