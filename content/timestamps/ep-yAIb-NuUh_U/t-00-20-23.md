## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Then in Santa Ana, California, there's a fellowship of Calvary Chapels, which includes Idaho—the North County Chapel in Post Falls, Idaho. They're currently being sued by victims who accused the church of intentionally concealing a known sexual predator in their midst. They knew his history. They hired him anyways—Anthony Iglesias—and he's currently serving time. He was found guilty in Idaho State Correctional Facility for his crimes. The lawsuit alleges that when the victim's parents went to the lead pastor, Reverend Robert Davis, to discuss their son's sexual abuse, Davis acknowledged to them—and again, this is what their lawsuit is alleging—that he knew of Iglesias' history.
