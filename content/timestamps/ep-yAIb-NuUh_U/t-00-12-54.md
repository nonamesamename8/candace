## Transcript

**Rob McCoy:**
> I was so compelled because of the gossip and the slander of my friend who's going to join me that I wanted him to tell a story. So 20 years ago when we were over at Skyline, the introduction was you walked in and you said, "I need to talk to you," and I got to share with you. And you were just pretty blunt. You just laid it out there. And you said, "This is what it is." And you followed the procedures. You did what was required of you. And you and I have been friends. There's been no issues. It's remarkable how you've served this community.
