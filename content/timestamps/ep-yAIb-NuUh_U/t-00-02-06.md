## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> I have not followed Candace (Candace Owens) closely. I know she was a good friend of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) years ago. In fact, when I first met Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I said, "You know, tell me a little about your ministry, you know, like what you do." And, you know, who have you mentored? He mentioned Candace (Candace Owens). And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would never speak ill of anybody privately unless he spoke to that person first and tried to correct them. So Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never said anything bad about Candace (Candace Owens) or anything, but I just find this idea that she's making all these suggestions without evidence very painful for people.
