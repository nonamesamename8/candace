## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So we actually did look really close on clear footage, and it looks like they're handing something off, but they actually don't. They're kind of like hitting each other like as if they're trying to coordinate. I mean, me and Mark looked at it very slow because I thought I saw the same thing. And then when we watched it from different angles, they don't actually do that. What's compelling is when you can't see them—when they're on the ground. It's just not clear to me what they are doing there. And of course, we know they then put down pavers almost immediately and releveled that area. So I do find that to be quite shady. I don't know what they were doing. Mint Julips writes: "Who was the lady donor that yelled at Charlie (Charlie Kirk) after one of the TPUSA shows?" "Was it Miriam Adelson?" No, it was not her.
