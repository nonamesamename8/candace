So this theme is kind of coming up when you start to see people who have been not just accused of crimes but convicted of crimes, and they wind up in positions of power or in positions of extreme wealth.

And now, flipping back to—from the Diddy insinuations here—flipping back to Rob McCoy, that's not the only scandal that he's been involved in. He's been involved in a few scandals, right? There was also a Potter's Field scandal. And this is kind of really relevant to leading up to what he's doing now with Turning Point USA. I would say it's very relevant.
