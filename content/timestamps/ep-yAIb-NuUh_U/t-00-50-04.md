## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys. You've heard me speak a lot about Nimi Skincare. You know I love them. I love their three-step anti-aging routine. It's done wonders for my face, which is why I am so excited that Nimi Skincare now has a complete body line as well. Their Foundations Body Bundle. It's a simple three-step routine. You get the Botanical Bliss body wash to gently cleanse with soothing botanicals, the revitalizing sugar scrub to exfoliate and to hydrate with vitamin C plus coconut oil, and the restorative body lotion to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy. And just like their facial skincare, the Nimi body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients. And best of all, it's made right here in the USA by a company that is built on our values: faith, family, and freedom.
