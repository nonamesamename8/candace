## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I hope I'm saying his last name right. Thomas Michael Camino was a man who was factually put away into prison for abuse—molesting, lewd conduct toward young girls. How he did this was he pretended that his cat was lost. I'm gonna read you an email that I received from one of his victims who is now an adult, but she was just an eight-year-old child back in 1995. Here's what it reads in part, okay? "I was eight years old living in Dana Point, California when Thomas approached my friend and me to help him find his cat." "He took us to a park behind my house and tried to molest me before I ran away."
