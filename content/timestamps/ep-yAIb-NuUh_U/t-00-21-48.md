## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> There is the Calvary Chapel in North Thurston, Oregon. And this one's a doozy, okay? The lead pastor was this guy, Jeffrey Keon Ziss. He confessed to sexual misconduct, which involved his three daughters over a period of two years. The incestuous abuse started when the daughter was 11. He went to prison for 11 months. And then when he got out, he murdered an 82-year-old— and then he was supposed to be her handyman, and then he murdered her and poured concrete over her body to hide the body, okay?
