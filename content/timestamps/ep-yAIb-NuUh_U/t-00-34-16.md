## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> We're done watering down what we believe to be palatable for the masses because we've realized that silence is not kindness. Silence is actually consent. And right now, the greatest silence is surrounding the topic of lives that are ended before they even take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we should act like it always. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love. For just $28—that is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion. Just $28 helps her to see the life that is growing inside of her. It gives her truth that our culture definitely does not. So do not sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. Be unapologetically pro-life. Go to preborn.org/candace right now. Give $28.
