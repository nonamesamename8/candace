## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> It's just literal perfection. What are you doing? Stop trying to gaslight us. You are a part of exactly what we need to defeat. You are a part of the establishment—this organ of people who use psychological tactics to try to make us think we are crazy for not accepting something that just makes no rational sense. So to all this is just a bad time and this is a wacko—wacko jacko—everybody's crazy. When you start questioning the feds, suddenly they want to call you crazy. And Tucker (Tucker Carlson) just annihilated it instantly. He's like, "Get out of here. I don't know where you're from, okay? Assume you're a foreigner and you think this is how things work in America— and we're just going to accept the Fed slop because that's what we should do as polite citizens?" No. Get out of here.
