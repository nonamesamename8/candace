## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> It starts with Cardi B and ends with Cardi B. So of course it's going to be fun if it starts with Cardi B and ends with Cardi B. You can buy that at makehimasandwich.com—even though it says it's available for pre-order. I will ship because we've already shipped out pre-orders. So there's that. MakeHimASandwich.com. Kay writes: "I just read that." Oh no, this is a different comment. "I finished Make Him a Sandwich, and it is a must-read for all." "I am saving this book for when my daughter is old enough to read it, and I am going to save up for a signed copy." "Keep writing, Candace (Candace Owens)." "I can't wait for you to publish more." And there was more that I want to add into the book, but things got crazy when I got fired, and I couldn't find time. But it is a fun read. Corey Henry writes: "Yay was and is smarter than people know."
