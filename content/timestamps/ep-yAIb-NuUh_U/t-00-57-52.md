## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Black Swan Revelations writes: "Love Candace (Candace Owens)'s videos. Keep up the great work." Mid-Runner writes: "Did you see L. Reeves attempting at interviewing Tim Dillon?" "It was like a cool uncle trying to impart common sense to his radicalized niece who just came back from her first semester at Berkeley." "I hope they release that full interview because she was really something— very patronizing, eyes always closed. The voice alone was very frustrating." And I was not in the mood because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had just died, and we basically kept the interview because we had set up the interview before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died. And I just really did not like that young woman. Very patronizing. Tim Hester writes: "Please wish Tim a happy birthday." "You and I often exchanged tweets back in 2011, 2012."
