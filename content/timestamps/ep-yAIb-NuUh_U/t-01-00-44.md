## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We're not doing any fiction right now because it turns out that real life is way more complicated and more interesting than fiction books that I've read. How could I think Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings was good? Look at what's going on right now. We've got some real evil people that are trying to come together. And I do think they're getting exposed. That's why I'm hopeful every single day. And I'm willing to take all of these figurative bullets from the foxhole. I've always had Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s back. He's always had mine. I'm not gonna stop doing that. I don't care who makes a video. I don't care if they hold up a Bible when they do it and blaspheme. I'm not letting this go. I'm going to ask actually every question until we start getting answers. And I sure as hell do not trust the people that are running Turning Point Faith
