## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled. Yep, Mark Twain—that is very true. But I think people are now realizing—we are all realizing—we have been fooled. Today's comments—we have Jennifer who writes: "I finished making my sandwich today." "Candace (Candace Owens) speaks with clarity and courage, reminding women that choosing faith, family, and traditional values is nothing to be ashamed of." "Her message feels honest, empowering, and much needed." "I highly recommend it." "Thank you, Candace (Candace Owens)." "Go max." I love "go max." I love it so much. And I do want to put it on like a T-shirt. But then they're going to say like, "Oh, she's trying to grift off of his death," even though everyone else sold T-shirts. And so I feel like I shouldn't do that, but I do love it. It's just so Charlie (Charlie Kirk). It's so Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to just say, "Go max." And thank you for reading the book. Honestly, I love it. I think you guys are going to love it. Obviously, I love it because I wrote it, but it's really fun. It's a fun read.
