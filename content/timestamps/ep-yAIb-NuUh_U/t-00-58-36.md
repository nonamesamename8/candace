## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> "I loved your smarts and wit." "Now my ex-liberal husband is your self-proclaimed number one fan." "Thanks for converting him." "Keep outshining the fake and gay." Happy birthday, Tim. Hope you have a fantastic day. And I'm so glad that you are now in our cult—as we've learned. We are actually a cult because we're thinking for ourselves. Nicole Howlett writes: "Imagine going to church and your pastor is bad-mouthing Candace (Candace Owens)." "Switch churches." "How embarrassing." "We love you, Candace (Candace Owens)." "Thank you for caring so much for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and not stopping until we know what's happening." Look, Pastor Hibbs is committed. I mean, 5 a.m. calls is crazy, right? Like, I'm not setting my alarm at 5 a.m. to host a quote-unquote prayer warrior thing.
