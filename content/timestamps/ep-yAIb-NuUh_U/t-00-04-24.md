## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Allie Stuckey just did this—shot a video and was like, "I don't have these dreams." The idea here is this must just all be crazy rantings every day. Candace (Candace Owens) is up on this show like Ms. Cleo from the '90s and just predicting what she thinks happened. It's such a ridiculous way to try to delegitimize the research that we have done. Now, again, I don't know how you're able to comment if you have not watched what I said, but we are only interested in getting to the truth. So here's what I did. I personally invited Frank Turek onto the show because we legitimately want answers. Now, to his second point that he is making there, where he is trying to now say, "This is not how court cases work." We're not looking to have a conversation with the prosecution.
