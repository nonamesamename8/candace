## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They're called Seven Weeks Coffee because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean. That's the same time a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. They built their business around saving lives by donating 10% of every sale to pregnancy care centers around the world and pro-life organizations nationwide. They've now raised over $1 million and saved thousands of lives. And I can tell you that the coffee is fantastic. It's mold-free, pesticide-free, shade-grown, and low acid. And it's organically farmed. So head to 7weekscoffee.com, and you'll save 15% forever when you subscribe. And this holiday season, you can claim up to four gifts with your order. Plus, exclusively for my listeners, use code CANDACE, and you'll get an extra 10% off your first order.
