## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's what you see playing out on the world stage when someone tries to struggle-session a person into making a statement against one of their friends. "Candace (Candace Owens), you're better than Kanye." "You have your whole life ahead of you." "You'll have more of a future if you just say this one thing." "Call him Adolf Hitler." "Call him anti-Semite." No, thank you. I said no. "Charlie (Charlie Kirk), Candace (Candace Owens) is heading into a direction that's only going to hinder you." "We demand as donors that you do not let her speak at Amfest." "She's just a bad person." "You've got to make a statement against her." Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said no. "Megyn Kelly, it's your career or it's Tucker (Tucker Carlson)?" "You decide, right?" "I'm your friend." "I just want to help you." "Tucker (Tucker Carlson), he's really going a bad way."
