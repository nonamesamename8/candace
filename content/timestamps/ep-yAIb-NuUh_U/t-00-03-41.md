## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, so a couple of things I want to say here. First and foremost, I am loving this repeat talking point of people who claim that they didn't watch all the episodes, they don't have time to watch the episodes, they don't have time to go through the facts—and yet for some reason know that I said that I had a dream that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was betrayed, right? That's how you know that you are in the midst of a propaganda spell—that they have been delivered talking points. And it's such a minute point in all of the evidence I presented. I have done second-by-second timelines. I have done minute-by-minute timelines. I have presented webs of people and their connections. I presented a list of how many times he replied to Turning Point USA. They don't know any of that. What they know is that on one episode, Candace (Candace Owens) said that she had a dream, right?
