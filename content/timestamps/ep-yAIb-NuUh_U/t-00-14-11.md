## Transcript

**SPEAKER_6:**
> So this is like early '90s, the nice little beach community in Orange County. And I get accused of a crime that I did not commit. It's a falsely accused—it's an underage girl thing. And the premise of the case is there's a guy running around asking people about a lost cat. And this happens 15, 20 times over the course of six, eight months, and the whole town is getting in an uproar over it. They bring this girl and they film an interview. After I got involved in this whole thing, we didn't know this was part of the thing. They just spring this in trial. And it's this interview where the kid doesn't care what she's saying. She's not upset. She thinks she's waiting for her mom in the dentist office. And then they just keep asking her leading question after leading question.
