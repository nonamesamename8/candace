## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Lobo Gray writes: "Just want you to know, Candace (Candace Owens), that I'm 74 and I survived about a thousand hours of combat missions as a scout helicopter door gunner in Vietnam in 1970." "But your courage humbles me." "God bless you for the example that you're giving our younger generations about how to be an American and even just a decent human being." "I'm praying constantly for you." "Please be safe and watch your six." Well, thank you for your service in the Vietnam War— particularly. I'm not gonna rant—Henry Kissinger's war. And the truth about that—it's always been a war against Christians. And I'm not going to rant about that because it's not the book club, but I'm going to rant about that now next week in the book club. So there's that. But thank you. Too many of our men—good Christian men—have been killed, and the narratives that we have been told are completely untrue. Think before you type, right?
