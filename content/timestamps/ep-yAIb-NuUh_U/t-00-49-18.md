## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Tim Dillon's already included in my lawsuit with Brigitte Macron. Apparently, the president of France watches Tim Dillon, and we talked about the Brigitte case, and so he's dragged in there anyways. I'm looking forward to them putting Tim Dillon under oath. I don't know about the rest of you. Obviously, that's what America needs. This will be the only thing—and the only thing—that we have good going for us at this moment would be Tim Dillon under oath. And I strongly advise that Elijah Schaffer puts him under oath as well now that he's making these kinds of jokes. I mean, Kash Patel should sue—obviously sue Tim Dillon. I totally support that. If you'd like me to testify, Kash, give me... Give me a call. Absolutely amazing. All right, you guys. We are going to take a brief break, and then I'm going to come back and answer some of your comments and questions.
