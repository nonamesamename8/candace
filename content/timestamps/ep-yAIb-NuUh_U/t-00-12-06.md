## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, in response to this being discovered, Rob McCoy did not apologize. No, no, no, no. That's not how this works. Instead, you are about to see Rob basically employ tactics of psychological gaslighting. Maybe he learned this from his father who did this for Navy intelligence, right? But he is going to host Thomas Camino for a podcast episode on the Bryce Eddie Show. He's going to vent his frustration at the people who are up in arms about the placement of this man in close confines with young children without people recognizing that, okay, this guy has literally spent eight years in prison for abuse.
