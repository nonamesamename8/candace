## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was asking a lot of questions towards the end of his life, right? He was asking questions, hitting hard about Jeffrey Epstein on his show. He was exasperated at one point saying basically, "I've covered this." "I'm upset about this." And you could sense that from high up he was being told to stop speaking about Jeffrey Epstein, and he was pushing back on that. He then tells Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to go max against Jeffrey Epstein. For whatever reason, this guy—similar to these characters—had a history; he had been convicted, and yet he was still welcomed into every circle. He still is welcome into every circle. You guys still talking about Jeffrey Epstein?
