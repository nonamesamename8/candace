## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's actually just about how you shouldn't listen to Candace (Candace Owens) talk across. That's what's committed. You got to give them a little bit of credit for the 5 a.m. phone call. That's all I'll say. Mama Diaz writes: "The Calvary Chapel I would watch online had a pastor that said, 'If you have a Bible that has a map that shows Palestine, burn the Bible.'" "I could feel his hate through the screen." "It was the last time I watched a sermon of his." Yeah, I think it's interesting that they get started—hippie movements. Yeah, that sounds about right. The '60s was a hell of a time—as we learned in my book club reading Chaos. Then they killed JFK, and suddenly the Calvary Church is born. And you've got all these military men who are now what—LBJ's military men? And they're really focused on Israel?
