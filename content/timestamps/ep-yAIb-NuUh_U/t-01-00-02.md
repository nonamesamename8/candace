## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I'm just saying—I know we're not allowed to ask questions. Sue me—sue me for asking questions. You're not allowed to unless you have the facts in front of you because I'm sure Israel is just going to come to us and say, "Here's how we did it." "Here's the map of how we did it." Until they do that, don't ask any questions about what they're doing around the world. It's not appropriate. Also, it's anti-Semitic. I read it on the internet. Silicon Valley writes: "Hi, Candace (Candace Owens). Thank you for your great reporting." "Better than the FBI. Your research inspired parts of my new historical thriller novel. Their Black Vault—fiction for your book club?" I am not familiar with that thriller. Our book club—we are right now not reading any fiction. Oh, I guess you're saying it's not fiction. I'm not sure if it's fiction. No, it does say fiction.
