## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Potter's Fields is an area up in Whitefish, Montana, and the Calvary Church Association funded a ministry which came to be known as Potter's Fields Ministries, right up there. They have a hunting ground. They have a camp for kids. They have a student program known as Ignite. They even have like a burger chain. I mean, a lot of money was flowing up there. And in 2019, the ministry came under a scandal with reports of financial abuse, psychological abuse. Essentially, the Calvary Chapel church members were funding the ministry believing that money was going to help and feed and clothe children in Uganda, in Cambodia, in Costa Rica, in Guatemala.
