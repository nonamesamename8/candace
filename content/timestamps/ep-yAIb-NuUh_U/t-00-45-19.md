## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I actually don't believe—don't accept that Alex Wilkins—who comes from a family of Freemasons and who's got a spotty background—nobody knows what she was doing in Switzerland—just loves him for him and was in the right place at the right time. By the way, I should mention Alexis Wilkins is her name—Alexis Wilkins. She's also a member of the Calvary Chapel Church in California—Chino Hills. Also the Babylon Bee guy—I can't think of his name right now—is also involved in the Calvary Chapel. We gotta look into this Calvary Chapel thing. It's getting interesting. It just is getting interesting. Irrespective of that, the lawsuit—filing a lawsuit to convince yourself and backing your life partner as she files a lawsuit because somebody made a joke. Because that's what Elijah Schaffer's lawsuit is about. It's a joke.
