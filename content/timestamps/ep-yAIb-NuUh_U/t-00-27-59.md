## Transcript

These churches—when they were all getting on stage for Operation Mocking Pastor, where they were all saying the same thing about me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson)—they were the number one offenders. I am not kidding. You start to ask yourself, what is guiding the Calvary Chapel, right? What is behind this? Do you really think this is all just accidental—their obsession with Christian Zionism? Jack Hibbs among them? We mentioned him yesterday—his brother Butch Hibbs, who was just everywhere before and after Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. There's like footage of him, which I don't think we have for today. I think we did pull it, but I didn't ask you to pull it for right now.
