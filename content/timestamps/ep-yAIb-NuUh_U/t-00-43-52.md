## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> are trying this on you—trying to manipulate you using Bible verses like Allie did after she just seated so much—essentially fundamentally called me a liar in her own way about various things—is now pretending she's like an injured bird because I responded, and I responded nicely. But suddenly trying to tell you it's not biblical for you to pry into what's happened to the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination case. This is just not biblical. It's complete nonsense. She did a video yesterday. "I don't get dreams like Candace (Candace Owens)." We see what you're doing. It's petty. Now you're being petty, Allie. If you want to get involved in this case, do it. If you don't, step aside. You are not required to respond to Candace (Candace Owens)' content. That's actually not a requirement.
