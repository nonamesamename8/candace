## Transcript

**Candace Owens (clip):**
> And it is the case that dinosaur bones, for whatever reason, are always just found by the paleontologist. It's not like you and me walking outside. I'm like, "Hey, a dinosaur bone." Or by somebody who's related to a paleontologist. It's very strange. And then, but it was just convenient for Israel that JFK got shot. It was just convenient, you guys. Totally convenient. It was convenient for Israel, by the way, when the towers went down. I just want to be clear. Anything happens to me, blame the Zionists. Like, 1000% blame the Zionists.
