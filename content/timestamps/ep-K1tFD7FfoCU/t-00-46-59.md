## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> truth is that I grew up poor. I was the third of a family with four children. The mom didn't even graduate high school, actually. And my family didn't have the money to send me to college. So I took out a ton of loans—student loans, Sallie Mae loans. And then in—don't quote me on the year, but I think it was 2010— Sallie Mae had a big collapse, and they said, "You can't go back for your senior year because we can no longer fund you to go back for your senior year." So I dropped out temporarily. And then I—when I had my own money and paid off my student loans—which was something like $150,000 in student loans, which is absurd to me, such a predatory system— you're literally preying on poor people. Disgusting.
