## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> "So we never forget this moment of us having triumphed over Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro)." And he actually does it. And it was completely hilarious. And this is actually the photo from that. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did that totally on purpose. That was such a Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) thing to do. And it became like our perfect inside joke every time we felt like he was kind of saying little things about us. And that was Charlie (Charlie Kirk). That was just the spirit of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And he moved on from it. He was always cordial beyond that. He never felt any nastiness. The point of me sharing this though is to make it very clear that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) loved Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I can go through all my messages with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and he loved Tucker (Tucker Carlson). Not for a single second did he not admire and respect and greatly appreciate Tucker (Tucker Carlson), and he fought for Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to be on the Turning Point stage until his dying day—literally.
