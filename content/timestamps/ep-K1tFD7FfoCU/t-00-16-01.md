## Transcript

**Candace Owens (clip):**
> We can roll that. (Candace Owens (Candace Owens) on Joe Rogan (Joe Rogan) clip): Like, I can't take anything seriously anymore. Well, there's things to be taken seriously, but celebrities probably are on that list. Yeah, so Ben Shapiro's (Ben Shapiro) right. Yeah, no. Well, he's right about this, you know. But he was like trying to correlate like what Kim did like with Alice Marie Johnson (Alice Marie Johnson) was like that, and I'm like, "Come on, man. That's like totally different." And just in general like sometimes he just gets a little like hall monitor for me. Like, you know, like it's just like, you know, he can't help himself. I know he's a funny guy. Yeah, it's very snarky. I like him a lot. I like him too. That's the thing. We actually really get along, but the hall monitor—I know these types in school. I was in their classes. They're just late to school. The last person you want to see is the hall monitor. The idea that she would be late.
