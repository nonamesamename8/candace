## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Lighthearted joke. But specifically Ben (Ben Shapiro) said to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) that he was upset about that and that I, Candace (Candace Owens), was going to Milo (Milo) my career if Charlie (Charlie Kirk) didn't get away from me. Now, obviously, the story goes, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) stuck with me despite Ben's (Ben Shapiro) urging. We kept climbing. We reached a point where as a team, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I were suddenly undeniable. Some producer in June of 2018 then reached out to us to book us on Ben's (Ben Shapiro) show. And honestly, I'm so glad they did this because in retrospect, it's actually one of my favorite Charlie (Charlie Kirk) memories— because it just makes me smile to reflect on because Charlie (Charlie Kirk), he was never mean-spirited. He always was just funny. He always chose humor—lighthearted humor—to get over any situation. He was never a person that wielded and dealt behind the scenes to prevent other people from becoming successful.
