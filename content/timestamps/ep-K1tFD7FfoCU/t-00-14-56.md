## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) found out that Ben (Ben Shapiro) was operating behind the scenes to stop him and sort of hinder the growth of Turning Point USA in our early days—right when things—when we were kind of coming up together, or me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) as partners getting out there—and I have only about 80 to 150 text messages from Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to that effect. This is not a debate, by the way. This is a fact. So challenge me to share the messages. I will gladly. Now, when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) tried to figure out where the sudden hostility was coming from—because he at first admired Ben (Ben Shapiro), like I admired Ben (Ben Shapiro)—actually Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was the one that told me, "You should watch Ben (Ben Shapiro) debate videos so you can strengthen your debate skills." The next thing we knew, we were hearing that he was trying to block us.

## Claims Made

- [factual] Ben Shapiro told Charlie that Ben Shapiro was in part upset because I made a joke about him... and that I, Candace Owens, was going to Milo my career if Charlie didn't get away from me.
  - *Follow-up:* Charlie Kirk's texts recounting conversation with Ben Shapiro
