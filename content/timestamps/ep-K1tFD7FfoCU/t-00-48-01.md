## Transcript

> "So anyone who is divisive over this right is—as Candace (Candace Owens) says it—fake and gay." Yeah, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) believed in free speech. He didn't even blink when I hosted Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). What an absurd idea that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have—if Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ever messaged me and said, "You're betraying me by speaking to this person." I wouldn't have been friends with him. That's the reality. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was so cool. And that's why I hate that they're trying to make him like a dork in the afterlife. I don't say a dork as in someone that's like well-researched and knows the facts. I mean somebody that is so lame that they cannot beat you in the free market. So they're trying to arbitrarily force you out—as they are doing to Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson)—because you're so—you're bigger than them.
