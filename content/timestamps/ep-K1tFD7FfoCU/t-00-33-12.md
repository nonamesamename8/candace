## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> They don't believe what time text messages were sent or when the phone calls took place. You know, Rob McCoy (Rob McCoy) is lying. In the areas that you can control the transparency, I think doing that would be beneficial to Turning Point USA because I don't think Turning Point USA is going to survive if they continue down this path of, you know, Tyler Bowyer (Tyler Bowyer) late-night tweeting at donors as he did over the weekend. I think he directed his fire at like John Mappin (John Mappin), and Arena Mappin (Arena Mappin) called John Mappin (John Mappin) a loser. I don't think that that's the correct messaging to come out of Turning Point USA. And there is something that my husband always says to me, and I don't know if he got it from somebody else. He probably did.
