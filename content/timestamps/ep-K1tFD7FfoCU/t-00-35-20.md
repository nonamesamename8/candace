## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I look forward to obviously watching the interview that is going to premiere in two days on Fox News with Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters). I will certainly be watching now. Speaking of a lack of transparency, I am everyone right now when I say that Kash Patel (Kash Patel) is the most embarrassing human in the United States. Embarrassing for two reasons. One, Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was a big supporter of Kash Patel (Kash Patel), had him on his show, really pushed for him to get the role that he is in—director of the FBI—and he has just been terrible in this case. He just has been objectively, okay?
