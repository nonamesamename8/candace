## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> I don't say a dork as in someone that's like well-researched and knows the facts. I mean somebody that is so lame that they cannot beat you in the free market. So they're trying to arbitrarily force you out—as they are doing to Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson)—because you're so—you're bigger than them. So trying to create scandal—they're trying to scandalize your name so that people stop watching you and trying to say, "Well, you can't speak on this platform" because they can't beat you by being themselves because they suck. They're annoying. People don't like them anymore. It's not cool to say "don't have a conversation." It's not cool to hold up like some donor-printed signs and do a dance in front of Randy Fine. "Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA."
