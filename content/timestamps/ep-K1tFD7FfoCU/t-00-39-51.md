## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> It's sweet that you call your girlfriend that, okay? She's just not a country music sensation. It's ridiculous. It's like me talking to my daughter. Like I do tell her she's a sensation. She's everything. She does is sensational. It's just—it's so unbelievably petty. It's ridiculous. This entire tweet—I just went, "Not every thought you have in your head needs to be sent." This does not make you look masculine. It does not make you look like somebody you should be taking seriously. There was no question that Vladimir Putin and the homies laughed. They did—without question. They're on a group chat right now. [laughter] She makes commentary on the internet, okay? Fair game.
