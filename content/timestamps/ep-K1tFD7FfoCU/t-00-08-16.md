## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I got you guys, okay? And it's just a little bit of common sense. Before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died—really kind of just before he died in July—I interviewed Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I discussed the interview, and never once did he tell me not to speak to Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). Never once did he consider it an act of betrayal. To the contrary, I had a very long discussion with him. I also had a long discussion with Andrew Kolvet (Andrew Kolvet) separately, telling them both that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) should host Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) on his show and debate him. I tried to make that happen. You guys will recall this. Andrew Kolvet (Andrew Kolvet) can confirm that everything that I am saying is true. Oh, it's such an act of betrayal to speak to Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes). Never at any point did Charlie (Charlie Kirk) say, "Don't do that." Because that's ridiculous. It's not who he was.
