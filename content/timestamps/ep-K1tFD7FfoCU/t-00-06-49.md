## Transcript

We all know—as I proved—that these same individuals were squeezing Charlie (Charlie Kirk) leading up to the end of his life.

And they want him to be canceled. Only people that they control are allowed to be in positions of power. So recently, Tucker (Tucker Carlson) interviewed Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes).
