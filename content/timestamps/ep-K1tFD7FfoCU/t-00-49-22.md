## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Also reminding you guys: Make Him a Sandwich. If you want to buy that, go to makehimasandwich.com. You guys are gonna love this book because it truly is very true, and it's very funny, and it's the things that I have gone through—obviously as a woman and kind of waking up to the reality of where that feminist movement came from: Emma Goldman (Emma Goldman)—speaking of "Beyond the Pale"—that will make sense. That's one of the names of the chapter: "Beyond the Pale." And you will know more about where all of these bad ideas happen to come from. Anyways, you guys, that was a fun Monday. Tomorrow we're going to jump back into the timeline because I've got some amazing little fact toys to add to it. And yeah, things got real interesting for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) after Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) hit the stage, and we're gonna speak about that. So I will see you guys tomorrow.
