## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> But everything that she has done has been—she's been having conversations with people who were actually friends with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Erika (Erika Kirk) is also—I think—slated to join Megyn Kelly (Megyn Kelly) on tour. Don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure I saw that being teased. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) opened up to Megyn (Megyn Kelly) in the end. Megyn (Megyn Kelly) stood 10 toes down on telling the truth—which is why I deeply respected her for doing this—about the pressure that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was under. And it was not easy for Megyn (Megyn Kelly) to do that, okay? She is still catching heat for the fact that she did that. So I feel like Erika (Erika Kirk) is kind of sending a message here that she's not standing against the people that are telling the truth. I said early on: if Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk) asks me to be quiet, I will be quiet.
