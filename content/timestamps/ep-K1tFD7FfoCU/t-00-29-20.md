## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> She didn't ask me to be quiet. So I don't know what I'm supposed to do. A show on whether I like her hair, her outfits—that doesn't feel right. And also keep in mind that is the mother of Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk) children. I had a real relationship with Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), a real friendship with Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). And what is left of him in this world are his two small children. So to just take a baseless attack—if I catch her in a lie, it's a little different—to just take an attack on her does not feel appropriate to me. I haven't seen any reason to do that. So I'm looking forward to the sit-down with Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters). I think we're going to get a lot more from Erika (Erika Kirk), and we're going to see where her mindset is.
