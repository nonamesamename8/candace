## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You can always tell who they control because they don't condemn them even when they, like Randy Fine (Randy Fine), just come right out with genocidal language against the Palestinians— referring to them as subhuman, laughing when he sees a dead body of a Palestinian. They don't care. They support it. They cover it up. But Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson)? Oh, no. He's having conversations with people that they don't like. It's that simple as to why they go after him. That's also why they fired him from Fox because he was speaking out against the Ukrainian war, and that was not allowed. They thought that firing him would effectively ruin him, and he wouldn't be able to secure another big contract within the apparatus that they very much control. And it turns out Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) actually got even bigger, and he became even more well-liked, and they want justice for that.
