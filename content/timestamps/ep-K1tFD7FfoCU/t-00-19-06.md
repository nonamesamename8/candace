## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was not in love with Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro). He didn't hate Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro). He just, I would say, experienced Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro). We all get the Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) experience at some point. Despite this, he always—as I said—kept it cordial because that's who he was as a person. But what I will not allow is this absolute inversion of reality where Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) becomes any sort of voice on who is and who is not betraying their friendship with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I will not allow it. Like I said, everybody has a vice. And when I reflect on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk), it is probably that he associated success and growth with money. And I believe that that is probably the conduit for the snakes that got into his company, got into the donor base—whatever it is.
