## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> Let me be clear: we will not be distracted by baseless rumors or the noise from uninformed internet anarchists and the fake news. I've always said criticize me all you want, but going after the people doing great work, my personal life, or those around me is a total disgrace. The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis—a true patriot and the woman I'm proud to call my partner in life—are beyond pathetic. She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in 10 lifetimes. I'm so blessed—sorry, pull that back up. I gotta finish. I'm so blessed that she's in my life.
