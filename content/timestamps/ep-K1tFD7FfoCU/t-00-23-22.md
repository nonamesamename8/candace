## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You're not getting away with it. The people don't believe you. It doesn't matter how much money you spend, how many talking heads you send out to pretend that he didn't waver in his support. He did. He did. We've been reading Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in his own words, okay? Like, you can't undo this. It's lost. Yes, he supported Israel throughout his entire career. And then he felt the Agent Smiths coming in, pressing him and pushing him—ironically over Tucker (Tucker Carlson). And it really shows that you have no shame to do it again—to do it again posthumously—to say "Tucker (Tucker Carlson) must never speak on a Turning Point stage."
