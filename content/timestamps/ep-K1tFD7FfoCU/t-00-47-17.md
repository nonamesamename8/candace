## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then in—don't quote me on the year, but I think it was 2010— Sallie Mae had a big collapse, and they said, "You can't go back for your senior year because we can no longer fund you to go back for your senior year." So I dropped out temporarily. And then I—when I had my own money and paid off my student loans—which was something like $150,000 in student loans, which is absurd to me, such a predatory system— you're literally preying on poor people. Disgusting. That's what college is all about. Once I paid down my student loans, I re-enrolled to finish my last year. And so I have two degrees, actually. What else do we have here?
