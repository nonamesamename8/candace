## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> And exclusively for my listeners, if you use code Candace at checkout, you'll get an extra 10% off your first order. So that's a total of 25% total savings on your first order and a free gift. Just use code Candace at 7weekscoffee.com. All right, let's get into some of your comments. Maxi Dodo starts. He writes: "Dear Candace (Candace Owens), thank you for being a true friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." "My son's middle name is Charlie." "He is nine, and you have helped make his name even stronger." "You are an inspiration." "God bless you and your family." Michael writes that from Australia. Thank you, Michael. I love that what I say has reached Australia. I wish that I was not banned from Australia, but you know me—I'm a super bad criminal, bad to the bone. I won't worship Israel. Stacey Massey writes: "So many trolls in the chat, yet by being here they are supporting Go Candace."
