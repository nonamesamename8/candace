## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> The coffee stands for something that we deeply believe in here, which is it's the pro-life American coffee company on a mission to fund the pro-life movement— one cup of coffee at a time. They are called Seven Weeks. You guys know why: because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean. That's the same time that a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. They built their business around saving lives by donating 10% of every sale to pregnancy care centers and pro-life organizations nationwide. They've now raised over $1 million, and they saved thousands of lives. And I can tell you that the coffee is fantastic. It's mold-free, pesticide-free, shade-grown, low acid, and it's organically farmed. It truly checks all the boxes. So head to 7weekscoffee.com, and you'll save 15% forever when you subscribe, plus you'll get a free gift with your order.
