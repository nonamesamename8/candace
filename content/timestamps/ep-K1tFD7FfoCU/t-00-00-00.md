## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys. Happy Monday. MAGA civil war—at least that's what they are trying to brand it as. They say that's what's going on. But really, we all know it's more like Never Trumpers have now infiltrated the MAGA movement, and they're trying to dictate the terms like we didn't notice. Randomly, Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) apparently woke up this morning and chose violence. He put me in his anti-Tucker (Tucker Carlson) montage monologue. We'll see what he had to say in a little bit. And it just so happens to be exactly what every Zionist has had to say in the last 24 to 48 hours—almost as though it's scripted. In other news, Erika Kirk sat down with Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters). Now the full interview has not yet aired, but it's already going viral. Just a preview clip of it, and we're going to discuss it.
