## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> But the truth, obviously, is never what Zionists are concerned with. They want Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) legacy by any means necessary. They want people to believe that his legacy belongs to Israel somehow. And the harder that they work to lie about his legacy, the more the world wakes up to the truth about it. They are waking up to the truth about how Charlie (Charlie Kirk) really felt. It's just becoming too obvious. Anyway, let's get to Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro), okay? Because on his show today, he took a very—dare I say—scripted stab at Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson). Same talking points. "Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) has betrayed Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) by hosting Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes)." And for absolutely no reason at all, I caught a stray bullet, which tends to happen. For whatever reason, they get mad at Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson). They attack me.
