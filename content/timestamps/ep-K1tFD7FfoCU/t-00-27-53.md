## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anybody that's told a lie—Rob McCoy (Rob McCoy), blood all over him— you got my attention. What lie has Erika (Erika Kirk) told that I'm supposed to be focused on, okay? Has she said something about—did she come out and say, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) never had an issue with Israel in the end"? "He loved Israel to his dying breath"? She hasn't done that. She simply hasn't done that. What we have around the corner is a big interview that's going to be dropping this week. Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk) sat down with Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters). And I can tell you, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) loved Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters). Jesse Watters (Jesse Watters) gave us the most play time on Fox News back in the beginning. That was the big show that we got to book. And so it's a good fit. It's a fitting program for her to go on to. If she was sitting down with like Benjamin Netanyahu's (Benjamin Netanyahu) entourage, I might have something to say.
