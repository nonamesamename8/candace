**Candace Owens:**
> And let's be honest: when you've got a big and busy family, slowing down is not always an option. It takes me literally five seconds in the morning, and I feel the difference all day long. Their best seller is Dose for Your Liver, which is formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion, and to maintain your body's filter. Dose's clinical results showed lowering liver enzyme levels by 50% in most of their participants. One shot of Dose for Your Liver is equivalent to 17 shots of turmeric juice. Dose is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, and it's vegan. Stick with Dose, and you will feel the incredible benefits over time. More energy, better digestion, reduced bloating, healthier liver enzyme function, reduction in brain fog, plus better sleep.
