## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So I agree with the sentiment, and I'm glad that she has pointed out how ridiculous it is to not lock cameras into the courtroom, how ridiculous it is to allow him to appear virtually—not even on camera—for some pre-hearing matters. None of this makes any sense to the public. And what I did say early on—I don't remember which episode it was— was I would not have wanted Erika (Erika Kirk) to—it would not be my—it would not have been my advice for Erika (Erika Kirk) in a stage of grieving to go from being the widow to being the CEO and the chairman of the company. If I was running the company, I would have said, "Let's put in place an interim CEO," right? Someone below Justin Strife (Justin Strife)—I think was the COO. I would have put in an interim CEO and allowed people to figure things out
