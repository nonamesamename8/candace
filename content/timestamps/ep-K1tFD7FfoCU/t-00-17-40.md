## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It just wasn't in him, right? He wasn't vengeful. Vengeance is actually kind of the vice that I've had to work on a lot. But Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) perspective was just laugh and move on. Anyway, the story goes, we get the invite to be on Ben Shapiro's (Ben Shapiro) show. And I'm like, "No, F that. He was so awful to us." "He said this about me miloing my career." "We should not do his show." "Why would we do his show?" And Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) like, "No, it's great." "Let's do it because we won." "OK, we won, Candace (Candace Owens)." And I'm like, "OK, fine." We get to the location. I think it was in Sherman Oaks, California at that time. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) says to me—we're in the green room— "Hey, will we take a photo with him?" "I'm going to puff my chest out and stand extra tall."
