## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like, you know, we should all want to sit with them, support Israel, or you can't sit with us. Can't sit with me, Randy Fine (Randy Fine), and Lindsey Graham (Lindsey Graham). And to show us just how hip and motivated and relevant they are, they sent some poor interns—it looks like they sent some poor interns down to FedEx or Kinko's or UPS—to print out these totally organic red signs. And the signs read—I don't know how he's going to get over this— "So Tucker (Tucker Carlson), if you need to take a couple of days off, we get it." But the sign said, "Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA." There's something about it that's so dorky. Sick burn. Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA.
