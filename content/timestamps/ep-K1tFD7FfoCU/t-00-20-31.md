## Transcript

> to host Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk) show because they wanted to keep it going. And they were told that that was not allowed to happen unless Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) was also invited. And in the true spirit of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), Turning Point cordially accepted those posthumous terms. Anyways, those are the facts. Turning my attention to another matter: Israel is rather obsessed with this already failed operation to stage a hostile takeover of the legacy of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk)—so obsessed that the Jerusalem Post completely fictionalized or rather published a completely deranged lie about Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk).
