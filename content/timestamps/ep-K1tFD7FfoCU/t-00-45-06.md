## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> It's like this: if they were ever going to steal me and make me so angry that I would just be on a warpath, it would have been by assassinating Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) and making me watch it. Truly—like if you wanted a political foe, this was the way to do it. And what's so funny is I've said in so many rooms like most people consider me as a formidable enemy, but I'm a much more formidable friend. And I'm going to continue to be a formidable friend to Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). And the best way that I can do that is just telling the truth. No matter what the truth is, I can just share the truth. And that's the amazingness is like we just constantly texted all the time. And as I said, I have no reason to lie. Is it Turning Point USA has access to all his messages?
