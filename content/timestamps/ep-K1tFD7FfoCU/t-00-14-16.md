## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is, in short, a terrible friend. Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) was supposedly Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk) friend. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) believed that Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) was vermin. That's a direct quote. He believed that because Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) dedicated his life to destroying Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) and TPUSA from the inside. So first and foremost, the idea that in order for you to show that you're a good friend of somebody, you have to agree not to host people on your platform from conversations is just so anti-Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—it's unbelievable. It's just disrespectful, really, to his legacy. And it is simply a fact—which I feel comfortable sharing now—that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) did not get along.
