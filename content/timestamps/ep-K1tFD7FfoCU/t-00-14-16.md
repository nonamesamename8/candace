## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) is, in short, a terrible friend. Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) was supposedly Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk) friend. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) believed that Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) was vermin. That's a direct quote. He believed that because Nick Fuentes (Nick Fuentes) dedicated his life to destroying Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) and TPUSA from the inside. So first and foremost, the idea that in order for you to show that you're a good friend of somebody, you have to agree not to host people on your platform from conversations is just so anti-Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—it's unbelievable. It's just disrespectful, really, to his legacy. And it is simply a fact—which I feel comfortable sharing now—that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Ben Shapiro (Ben Shapiro) did not get along.

## Claims Made

- [factual] [Unverifiable] Charlie and Ben Shapiro did not get along. Because Charlie found out that Ben Shapiro was operating behind the scenes to stop him and sort of hinder the growth of Turning Point USA in our early days... I have only about 80 to 150 text messages from Charlie to that effect.
  - *Follow-up:* Candace Owens' text messages with Charlie Kirk
- [factual] [Unverifiable] Charlie Kirk and Ben Shapiro were not on good terms because Ben Shapiro operated behind the scenes to stop Charlie Kirk from having Candace Owens on his show
