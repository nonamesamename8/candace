**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys—want to remind you about American Financing because the Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that is great news for American homeowners. If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there's no better time than now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. With rates dropping, now is the time to pay off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity that's in their home for instant savings. They're saving people just like you an average of $800 a month. And many are seeing rates in the low fives. That is a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, which will give you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before you know it. So do not wait.
