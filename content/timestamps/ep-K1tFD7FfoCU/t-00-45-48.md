## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They can tell you that the messages are real—whether they're true or whether they're false. And I—the truth is enough. The truth is always enough. Tom Paul (Tom Paul) writes: "Tyler Robinson's (Tyler Robinson) ACT score was 34, so he was in the 99 percentile." "Thomas Matthew Crooks' (Thomas Matthew Crooks) SAT score was in the 99 percentile." "Both recent lone shooters scored in the 99 percentile on standardized testing." "Not a coincidence—as if it is out of the same playbook." Something I want to say about that—something actually that I would like to reiterate about that—because I believe that is the reason for standardized testing: is that it flags for the government people that could be a problem down the line. It's kind of a repeat story in a lot of these mass shootings. I think also the one that was in—and I can't think of the guy's name—but it was in Connecticut: similar story.
