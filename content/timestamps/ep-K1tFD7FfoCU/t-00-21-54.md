## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So obviously the Internet was like, "This is crazy if this is true"—and Internet including me. I was like, "This is actually insane if this is true." "Steadfast support of Israel"—this is just a lie, and you know how I feel about lies. Fortunately, Andrew Kolvet (Andrew Kolvet), the spokesperson for Turning Point USA, instantly came out and slapped down the rumor. Andrew Kolvet (Andrew Kolvet) wrote this: "This is the first we're hearing of this." "We've reached out to the reporter at the Jerusalem Post for a correction." How do you just say "Erika Kirk (Erika Kirk) is going to accept this award on behalf of her husband because of his steadfast support for Israel"? That's not like a casual error, is it?
