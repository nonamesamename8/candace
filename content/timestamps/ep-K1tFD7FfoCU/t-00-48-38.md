## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So trying to create scandal—they're trying to scandalize your name so that people stop watching you and trying to say, "Well, you can't speak on this platform" because they can't beat you by being themselves because they suck. They're annoying. People don't like them anymore. It's not cool to say "don't have a conversation." It's not cool to hold up like some donor-printed signs and do a dance in front of Randy Fine (Randy Fine). "Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is not MAGA." People can see which way the wind is blowing, and it's against Israel because everything they do is uncool—and it also happens to be genocidal. So that doesn't help either. Anyways, you guys—tomorrow we have the book club. First time ever the book club was infiltrated. I'm proud of us. Very proud of us—people on the book club. So be sure to be there.
