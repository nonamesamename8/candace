Anyways, you guys—tomorrow we have the book club. First time ever the book club was infiltrated. I'm proud of us. Very proud of us—people on the book club. So be sure to be there. Also reminding you guys: Make Him a Sandwich. If you want to buy that, go to makehimasandwich.com. You guys are gonna love this book because it truly is very true, and it's very funny, and it's the things that I have gone through—obviously as a woman and kind of waking up to the reality of where that feminist movement came from: Emma Goldman—speaking of "Beyond the Pale"—that will make sense.
