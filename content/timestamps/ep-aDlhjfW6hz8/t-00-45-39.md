I actually think there was a person on TikTok—I hate to not credit them, but I genuinely don't remember what handle it was. I was just scrolling through—but he suggested that what went wrong was that they did use AI, and in their AI prompt, they said to create a conversation between 20-year-olds—or like a conversation between 20-year-olds—but they actually wrote, like, the AI understood it as, like, not people in their 20s, but, like, people in the '20s—like the 1920s. And I was like, that actually could have been what went wrong. They prompted AI, and they said between people in their 20s, and actually they wrote "people in the '20s," and they just went with it. And that's why you have this "Hello, my love."
