## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> If you wake up with a sore throat or runny nose, address your symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit containing ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, generic Tamiflu, generic Z-Pak, and much more. It's like having an urgent care clinic in your own home. I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from the Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line in an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. I simply open my kit, reference the doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and I get back to life. This kit is literally a lifesaver, with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who have had the kit ready in a time of need. So head over to TWC.health/Candace today and use code CANDACE to save $48. Get it now before cold and flu season kicks into high gear. TWC.health/Candace with code CANDACE for $48 off.
