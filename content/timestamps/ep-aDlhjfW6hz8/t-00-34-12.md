## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Charlie was concerned about the speech that he felt—the restrictions—and inevitably this happens when you get into bed with Israel. You can't criticize them at all, as Megyn said, before you start enduring threats. And what I have learned from the employees there is that back in May, Turning Point had some big changes—some odd changes, as they are describing it to me. Certain departments, people that were being fired, people that were told that they had to keep certain things a secret. Secret from whom? Secret from whom? Something is not right. Nothing we are being told is true. And the strangest thing is that Pam Bondi, who is a complete loser and a tool, is trying to use the assassination of Charlie Kirk to lay the groundwork for hate speech laws in America. The very thing that Charlie was fighting against. They all just got right to work trying to pass laws.
