## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> There's no other way to say it. Marc Andreessen—in on a deal with, I think it's Silver Lake Capital. What is it? Not Silver. Silver Lake—they're all coming together, and we knew this was going to happen. This whole fake "cancel TikTok." No, TikTok was going pro-Palestine, and a bunch of hedge fund people who are pro-Israel got involved. Trump (Donald Trump) pretended that he was going to rescue speech. No, he's handing it over to Israel. Okay. Wake up. If you're a Trump supporter, wake up.
