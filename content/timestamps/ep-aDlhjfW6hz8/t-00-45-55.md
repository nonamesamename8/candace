## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Why is that so accurate? What went wrong, FBI? What went wrong? Speak to us, let us help you. You guys are just old, like what's going on? I actually think there was a person on TikTok, I hate to not credit them, but I genuinely don't remember what handle it was, I was just scrolling through, but he suggested that what went wrong was that they did use AI and in their AI prompt, they said to create a conversation between 20-year-olds, or like a conversation between 20-year-olds, but they actually wrote, like, the AI understood it as, like, not people in their 20s, but, like, people in the '20s, like the 1920s. And I was like, that actually could have been what went wrong. They prompted AI and they said between people in their 20s, and actually, they wrote people in the '20s and they just went with it. And that's why you have this, "Hello, my love." It's so bad. It's a major blunder. It's a very bad blunder, you guys. But I'm happy it happened because everything is coming undone.
