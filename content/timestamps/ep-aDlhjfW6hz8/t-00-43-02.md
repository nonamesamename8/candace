## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's like they use our emotions—left versus right—to manipulate all of us. And it's completely wrong. It's completely crazy. And they're also calling for him to make a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk family and Turning Point USA. What? That's a shakedown. That's what they did to Kyrie Irving. I don't like what you said. Donate to the Holocaust Museum. What? I can't cheer this on, guys. I'm sorry. I can't cheer this on because I don't like it. I know for a fact—and I just showed you—that this was Charlie's fear. The government coming in on speech. That's what's happening right now. They're taking over our speech under the guise of fighting hate. TikTok, by the way— did you guys see this? Israel's pretty much taking over TikTok.
