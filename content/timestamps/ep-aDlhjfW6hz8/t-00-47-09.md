## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It could be from July. It was a poster—Superman. I'll explain to you why that poster—that picture—is definitely not taken in July. First, I want to tell you guys about PureTalk because our society works because of the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment: free speech, okay? Even if I hate your speech, I want you to have it. Everyday Americans should be able to speak openly, and they should be able to speak honestly about family, their traditional values without any retribution—obviously. And that's the principle that PureTalk proudly supports. They sponsor my show, which allows me to stand strong behind the microphone every day and share truth with you guys. If you want to support brands that defend freedom and pro-American values, I encourage you to switch your wireless service to PureTalk. You are going to get great 5G coverage, an extremely reliable and secure network. And with plans from just $25 a month, you'll save a ton of money.
