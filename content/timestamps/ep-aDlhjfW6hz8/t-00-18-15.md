## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This means that an operator could simultaneously monitor flow, view live video, and respond to alarms, which enhances both security and operational oversight. And strategic value for intelligence communities: knowledge of valve locations, models, and control systems provide insight into critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. Access to, or relationships with, manufacturers allows agencies to monitor, assess, and secure supply chains. Remote monitoring of valves and integrated systems can support emergency response simulations and national security exercises. And then they provide us with the real-world context by writing: companies like Caldera Engineering in Provo, Utah, manufacture specialized industrial valves and control systems.
