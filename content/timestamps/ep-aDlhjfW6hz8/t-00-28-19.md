## Transcript

**Candace Owens (archive):**
> "Well, let me tell you something, America. It does feel so good to go everywhere in the world and to realize that there is awakening not just happening here. Let me tell you guys: it's happening all across the globe. People are starting to ask the hard questions. And you know you start getting close when they start to call you names. They instantly want to suggest that there's something wrong and there's something backwards about being America First. You're starting to hear the way they're framing that now. When you say you're America First, they'll ask you, what do you mean you're America First? Do you mean that you're an isolationist? Do you believe that we shouldn't have did what we did during World War II—all these things trying to pollute it? It's not that difficult.
