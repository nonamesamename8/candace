## Transcript

> That's it. And I don't want to give mine up. But what these people are telling me is a very dark story that involves these donors, sponsors, influencers—a takeover of sorts that I think was happening right under Charlie's nose. And I want to say this formally as we keep investigating this. I believe that Charlie Kirk was betrayed by people who are close to him. Based on what I have seen—thus far the evidence, the quote-unquote "receipts"—that require a way deeper investigation into the apparatus, the financial apparatus at Turning Point, there was definitely some weird activity leading up to this moment happening at the organization.
