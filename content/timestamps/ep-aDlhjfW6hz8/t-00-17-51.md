Integration with above-ground systems. Modern valve networks can also integrate with cameras, sensors, alarms, and environmental monitoring. This means that an operator could simultaneously monitor flow, view live video, and respond to alarms, which enhances both security and operational oversight. And strategic value for intelligence communities: knowledge of valve locations, models, and control systems provide insight into critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.
