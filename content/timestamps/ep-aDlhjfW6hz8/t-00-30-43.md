## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He is just way too involved, concerned about Turning Point USA, the future of Turning Point USA, attacking Candace Owens. And I think something sinister is going on here. How can you not see that?

I'm not trying to be the heir to Turning Point USA. I kind of like my life. I don't want to take money from donors, okay? Because they do what they did to Charlie. They're not buying. They're not donating money to charity because they view it as a charity. They do it because they want to purchase your voice.
