I also want to say this. I have had a flood of Turning Point employees reach out to me. Maybe because he says she would have been the natural heir to Turning Point USA. I'm not trying to be the heir to Turning Point USA. I kind of like my life. I don't want to take money from donors, okay? Because they do what they did to Charlie. They're not buying. They're not donating money to charity because they view it as a charity. They do it because they want to purchase your voice.
