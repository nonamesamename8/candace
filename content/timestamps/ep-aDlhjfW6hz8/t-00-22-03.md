## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> It's consent in many ways. And right now, the greatest silence is around the lives that are being ended before they take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like that. That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For just twenty-eight dollars, that is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion. You can help her to see the life that is growing inside of her and to give her truth that the culture won't. So don't sit this out. Do not wait for permission. Be bold, be clear, be unapologetic in your pro-life stance. Go to preborn.org/Candice right now. Give $28. Give 10 times that if you can actually, because this is the line and it's time to stand on it. We must stand for truth and what is right. We must save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel.
