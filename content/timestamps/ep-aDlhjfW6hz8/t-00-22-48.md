## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Again, that is preborn.org/Candice to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also telling you guys about the wellness company, because it is flu season, which means that it's also flu shot season. After everything that we've been through over the last five years, the number of people getting flu shots is at a record low. I'm so grateful for that. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective at best, and that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from the Wellness Company. If you wake up with a sore throat or runny nose, address your symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit containing ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, generic Tamiflu, generic Z-Pak, and much more.
