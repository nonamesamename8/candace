## Transcript

**SPEAKER_5:**

And I would say at some level—in a very big way—were involved in the death of Charlie because they wanted this sort of radical way to push through laws. When something chaotic happens, we usually turn to the government. I mean, 9/11—what did we do? We gave them so much power, right? The Patriot Act. Do whatever—just keep me safe. It's like they see your emotion. They see this global emotion, and they want you to just agree with them that the next step is more power for the government. And this time we're saying no. No, Pam Bondi. No, thank you. Genuinely, why are you in office? How can this administration pretend that they are the same administration that they were in 2016 that were fighting against this?
