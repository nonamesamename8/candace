## Transcript

> But yes, as I said, there's an individual who was first on the scene just after the shooting. He's like up on the rocks near the car that Charlie gets taken away in while he's being carried away. Let's take a look at that footage actually first. Let's look at that footage. And don't worry, there's no gore in this episode. It's difficult for me to even look at that sort of footage. Take a look. You can see Charlie's there. And one of you guys caught this. You probably didn't even see it there. And we can get in a little closer. Do you guys have it? Slow it down, or do you guys just want to circle here? Okay.
