## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We have to fight this tooth and nail. The reason they're doing this, obviously, is because they can't win in the free markets. People are—as Megyn said—people that are under 30 are anti-Israel. So that means the future of America is anti-Israel. So what they're going to try to do is to pass speech laws—Bolshevik speech laws. They're gonna arrest us for saying that we don't support Israel. Something that Charlie was passionately against, okay? And we can show you next week clips of him hosting the debate about speech and Israel and whether or not everything was antisemitism.
