## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I was even surprised. PBD (Patrick Bet-David)—I mean, I've always been friendly with him. I've always been kind to him. I have done nothing wrong to him. And he seems to be kind of—he's the one who platformed, without any pushback, Eric Bolling. And I have an idea about why all that may be. I'll tell you in just a second. First, I want to remind you guys about GNOLand because what if smart contract platforms were not controlled by the elites or big tech? What if they were built by and for real builders—you know, the people? That's the question that GNOLand asked, and that's why they built GNOLand. They started with Golang, which is a language real-world developers already use, and they built a new platform around it. It's transparent. It's intuitive, and it just makes sense. There's not some confusing system of ones and zeros. It's open source.
