## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He posted: you know, instead of the angry finger pointing, can we just for one day agree that it's horrible and monstrous to shoot another person? On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents, and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence. You wouldn't have thought that he had posted that in terms of everyone that were just, like, stripping him of everything. And I want to be clear: I don't like Jimmy Kimmel, right? I think he is a part of the radical left. The people that are constantly shouting—I don't like him at all. But I'm just recognizing that our solution to being angry at each other always seems to be let's give the government more power, right? Let's give the government more power. And that's what happened here, okay? The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, jumped up, and he criticized Jimmy Kimmel's remarks.
