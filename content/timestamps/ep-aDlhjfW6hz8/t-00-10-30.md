## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I don't care about anything right now other than figuring out who killed Charlie Kirk. So in the short run, he agrees that rather than send the footage, he will get onto a FaceTime call with me and he will show me the footage on his computer. He did that and I watched the footage and I'm going to tell you what I saw. To the people specifically, the people that are in the military, people that know weapons, I'm telling you this because you might be able to add more color or more clarity here, what you would expect to see.
