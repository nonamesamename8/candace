## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This is just a wide shot so you can see what's going on here, and then we'll get a bit closer. I know you guys have pulled apart this footage a million ways, and thank you for that. And here's the closer version of that. You can see, slowed down here, he pulls out the chair, he stands on it, and yes, that would be a big no-no for a crime scene. You don't move anything. He takes down the camera that is directly above where Charlie was sitting and would be able to provide therefore a lot of insight. And then you can see he kind of sets the camera onto the desk, and it looks like he removes the SIM card from it, or the SD card, if you will, which we're watching right here.
