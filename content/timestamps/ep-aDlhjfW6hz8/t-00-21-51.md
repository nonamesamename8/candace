## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I have felt the sting of injustice myself, but I've also felt something else, which is courage. I'm done playing defense. I'm not going to water down what I believe to be palatable because silence is not kindness at all. It's consent in many ways. And right now, the greatest silence is around the lives that are being ended before they take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like that. That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For just $28, that is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion. You can help her to see the life that is growing inside of her and to give her truth that the culture won't. So don't sit this out. Do not wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. Be unapologetic in your pro-life stance.
