## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Well, obviously that's where things get into a pickle with me because we don't trust the feds. I'm like, no, we don't trust the feds, so we don't gotta do that. Just let me have the footage. I'm like, just send me the footage. Please let me look at it. There's a lot of conspiracies that are floating around right now. People don't know what to believe. People are doing very—what I would say—credible videos. People that certainly have the credibility are ballistics experts that are saying that what we see in the front is an exit wound, not an entry wound. I don't know one way or the other because I'm not an expert. I'm getting inundated with messages from people that hunt, people that are in the military, saying that this had to have come from another direction.
