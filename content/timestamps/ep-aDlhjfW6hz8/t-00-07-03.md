## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like, this is not the first thing I would do if I had just witnessed Charlie Kirk being shot. And I'll say this right now: he was extremely forthcoming. Like as soon as I reached out, I just sent a text because I still had his number, and he was extremely forthcoming. Immediately got onto the phone. And first and foremost, I should say, obviously he's seeing all of these clips going viral, and he is fearful for his family. He doesn't have any security and people are looking, you know? And he said, look, as you can see in the footage, I was sitting right to the left of Charlie when Charlie got shot. And I instantly knew that he was not going to be OK.
