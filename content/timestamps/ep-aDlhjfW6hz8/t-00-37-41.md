> And he was very clear in his perception that this is going to increase antisemitism—trying to pass speech laws or labeling people antisemites for criticizing Benjamin Netanyahu. It's all out there, and they're lying to you. Am I wrong, or am I cynical for believing that, yeah, the feds are obviously lying? And I would say at some level—in a very big way—were involved in the death of Charlie because they wanted this sort of radical way to push through laws. When something chaotic happens, we usually turn to the government. I mean, 9/11—what did we do? We gave them so much power, right? The Patriot Act. Do whatever—just keep me safe.
