## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, rare Friday episode. Gotta do a Friday episode here because this is just so important, and the vultures are circulating above, man.

I should first let you know that the Senate has voted, and they have passed a bipartisan resolution to designate October 14th, which is Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s birthday, as Charlie Kirk Remembrance Day. And I have to say, that is a very government maneuver. Like, we get a Martin Luther King Day. We've got Martin Luther King Boulevard. John F. Kennedy gets a library and a national day of mourning. But you know what? You know what I was thinking?
