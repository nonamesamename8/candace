## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm not going to this memorial because it's strange. To lie like this is very strange. For context, just so you can realize how odd this is: I spoke at Turning Point's conference—two conferences—last year. It's so easily—like I said—debunkable that you have to ask yourself why they are saying it. Here is me speaking on Turning Point USA's stage last year. And here's what I said, by the way, which got Charlie in a lot of trouble.
