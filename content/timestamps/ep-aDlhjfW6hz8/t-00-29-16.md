## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Yeah, it kind of went on and on, but it was kind of me saying—especially since three months earlier I had gotten fired from the Daily Wire—like, "Israel, you're not special." And yeah, Charlie got in trouble for the stuff that I said on stage. And then they came in and told that I was not allowed to speak at AmFest. The donors were making threats. But like, I went on tour with Turning Point last year. It's still on their website. It's so—this is like the strangest thing. We could pull up this website: Live Free Tour, Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens. Quiet breakup? What are we—why are we doing this? It's very strange. Here's all the places that we went to last year. Now they are pushing these headlines that are so far beyond the realm of reality, like the one that I just showed you, where they say that I'm angry.
