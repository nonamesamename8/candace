## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It is now—like I said yesterday—it feels like they are trying to get ahead of something, like they know more than we know. I don't know why you would say something or accuse somebody of saying something that they didn't. I do believe that there is very clearly—we all believe there's very clearly—a government-level conspiracy that is involved. There's no other way to assess those disastrous text messages—absolute disaster of a fed operation with those messages. Yesterday, I pretty casually mentioned to you guys something: that the doorbell cam footage, which TMZ happened upon somehow, was from a street upon which a ton of employees that work for Caldera Engineering live.

## Claims Made
