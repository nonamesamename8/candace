## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> There's nothing gory about this footage from the back. The thing that really stood out to me—and I just kept asking him to replay it over and over and over again—is that there's no blood. There's no blood from the back. There is no blood. So I think a lot of people were wondering whether or not that bullet pierced and went out the front. I think I vaguely even remember—and Skylar, you can maybe quickly look this up—but I thought the feds were saying they were looking for a bullet at some point, which is now very alarming to me. I don't understand that. How could they have been looking for a bullet? Because if I'm not seeing—and there isn't—I'm telling you, what happens in the front is not what happens in the back at all.
