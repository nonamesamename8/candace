## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Go to preborn.org/Candace right now. Give $28. Give 10 times that if you can—actually, because this is the line, and it's time to stand on it. We must stand for truth and what is right. We must save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also telling you guys about the Wellness Company because it is flu season, which means that it's also flu shot season. After everything that we've been through over the last five years, the number of people getting flu shots is at a record low. I'm so grateful for that. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective at best, and that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from the Wellness Company.
