## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I said, there is no way we are going to this event now. There's a 0% chance. First and foremost, why are you saying anybody can go to it? You just buy a ticket to the event, and you're all working to try to get me to confirm that I'm going. And you're doing this as if you're trying to like push my buttons and be like, we gotta make her get into her ego so she, like, shows up and, like, posts it on social media. Nope. Actually, you know, while I'm attacking the feds, maybe not going to a public event which the feds are organizing is probably a very good idea. I'm good. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna listen to "Power" on my headphones and go see Ye (Kanye West). How's that for a memorial for Charlie Kirk? That feels like the right thing for me to do right now. I'm not going to this memorial because it's strange. To lie like this is very strange.
