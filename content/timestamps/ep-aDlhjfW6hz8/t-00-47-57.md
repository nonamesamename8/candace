**SPEAKER_1:**
> PureTalk believes in creating American jobs and supporting small business. So if you're a small business owner, you can save even more while enjoying white glove service. Stand with companies who share your values. Go to puretalk.com/Owens to switch to my wireless company, PureTalk. Right now, you will save an additional 50% off your first month. Again, visit puretalk.com/Owens to make the switch today. I'll also remind you guys about American Financing because if you have been living on credit cards just to cover groceries, gas, and bills, you know those interest rates are absolutely brutal. Why keep paying 20% or more to the banks when you could just call my friends at American Financing, because they have mortgage rates right now that are in the fives and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pocket and out of the hands of credit card companies. Right now, American Financing is helping homeowners save an average of about $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high-interest debt, and there are no upfront fees, no obligations. And it's really just a 10-minute call that you make to a salary-based mortgage consultant.
