## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Right there. Right there, an individual standing there. Again, I am just amazed at the internet sleuths, as I was like, "Wow, that is very strange." That person appears to be calmly talking into their phone. It's like a circus around them. What's he doing? Who's he speaking to? Then just a couple of minutes afterward, that same individual appears alongside another individual, and he moves Charlie's chair. That's a crime scene. That's not good. And he moves it because he wants to stand on it as he takes down the cameras, or the camera, rather, that is just above Charlie's head.
