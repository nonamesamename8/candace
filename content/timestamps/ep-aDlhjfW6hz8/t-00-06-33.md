## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And they tell me the person's name, and I go, "Wait a second." And I look again. I'm like, "I know this person." It's been a few years, but I know this person. This person's been around Turning Point for quite some time, for years. Like I said, back when I was working at Turning Point, early days. So I'm like, "I'm just gonna reach out." Obviously, I know this individual. I'm gonna reach out and I'm gonna say, "Hey, what's up with this?" Where is this footage? Why did you do this? What were you doing up there on the rocks? What's up? Like, this is not the first thing I would do if I had just witnessed Charlie Kirk being shot. And I'll say this right now: he was extremely forthcoming. Like, as soon as I reached out, I just sent a text because I still had his number, and he was extremely forthcoming—immediately got onto the phone.
