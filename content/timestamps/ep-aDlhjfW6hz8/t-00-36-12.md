## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And they're doing it in the most disturbing way ever—by going after Charlie Kirk's legacy and using his assassination to say, oh, well, now we've got to get hate speech done—which, by the way, who was the person—what leader—who said that he was passing laws against speech in America? That was Benjamin Netanyahu. Okay, years ago, on record saying that he was working with the government of America, and any person that criticized Israel would find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Okay, you can find that clip of him saying that. And now what's happening when we have an occupied administration? There's no question Trump (Donald Trump) is occupied by Zionists. Okay, he's completely impotent. He's completely powerless. He cannot say anything that goes against Israel or Benjamin Netanyahu. He's letting them do whatever they want. No pushback whatsoever. It's very clear Benjamin Netanyahu is in control, and his administration is saying that. It's terrible. It's absolutely terrible, but this was the plan, okay? This was the plan. And we have to stand up to this, guys.
