## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, to be fair, Tyler (Tyler Robinson) is making it clear that he is responding to all of these tweets or Xs—whatever you're supposed to call them—because there have been people, he says, that have flat-out accused the organization of having a hand in Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk's (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk's) murder. He doesn't share when or where exactly that happened. I think people feel you're being dishonorable by not questioning the narrative, but I haven't read anybody that's explicitly accused them of murder. In fact, the tweets that he's responding to all seem to be pretty fair, in my opinion, you know?
