## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Tomorrow we start the book which they don't want to resell, which is crazy. I don't know where David Bakan's children are—the author of the book; he is Jewish himself—but I just want them to know that they're blocking money from you. They don't want the public to read this book—which you can download and find it online for free—but like still, it's pretty crazy that they are now realizing people are catching on. That book will dive into the Kabbalah. It's very important to know. Similarly, like I've said from the beginning, we have different denominations within Christianity. That's kind of what this whole episode has been about. I don't know why one—like, I don't know why so many evangelicals have such vitriol for Catholics. The feeling is not mutual. Genuinely, the feeling is not mutual on the Catholic side or on the Orthodox side.
