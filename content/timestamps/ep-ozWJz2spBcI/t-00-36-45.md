## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm gonna pull this photo up because I just want to look at the photo. This is literally her being shot in front of the gifts that people are dropping off for Charlie (Charlie Kirk). But maybe it's Photoshopped. Doesn't look like it is to me. Even if it was Photoshopped, I would be losing my mind. I don't understand how anyone would let this go out and think that it's okay if they knew Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I couldn't even speak to the press that week. I still haven't spoken to the press about Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), actually. I haven't even given one interview about Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), because it felt icky to me. I'm just focused on investigating his murder. Anyways, I want to read a little blurb from this article. Again, published September 18th.
