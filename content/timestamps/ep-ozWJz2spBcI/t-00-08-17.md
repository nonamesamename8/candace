## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> People were going, "I knew Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) and he was truly evangelical to his core. Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah." And I want to tell you this: it felt coordinated. It felt fake. It felt unnecessary. But most importantly, it was untrue. Okay, it wasn't true. And I'm going to share with you some more truth so that you can contextualize it. Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) was attending Mass weekly. He was sometimes even attending Mass daily. He was not attending Pastor Rob McCoy's church. As I mentioned before, yes, he was praying the rosary. Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk), in fact, was wearing the St. Michael pendant when he died, okay? As has already been publicized, Erika (Erika Kirk) took a Catholic bishop with her to pray over his body on the day that he died.
