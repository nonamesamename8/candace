## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Should I do what she did, and it would have been more moral for me to invite the Wall Street Journal a literal week after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was murdered to photograph me in high boots standing over his memorial site at the office—like the outside memorial vigil where people mourn and drop off flowers and gifts? Because that's exactly what Alex Clark did. And I thought it was icky. I thought it was gross. I didn't say anything because everybody mourns in their own way. But I gotta stop saying that. I gotta stop saying everybody grieves in their own way. This is the article that was published on September 18th. So we can assume that they at least photographed her one day—and interviewed her one day—earlier, right? That's being charitable. So this was done, latest—again—one week after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. Again, take a look at this. Pull that up.
