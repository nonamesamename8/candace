## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The last thought that I had as I spent days crying—okay, had difficulty physically pulling myself out of bed, felt like I was being a bad mother— was, "Man, I'm sure glad Donald Trump (Donald Trump) is president. MAGA." I didn't feel that way. Didn't feel that way. In fact, I was angry. I remember feeling angry when Trump (Donald Trump) moved to kind of do a same-time post—Benjamin Netanyahu—and then published a picture of Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) with an Israeli flag behind. I was pretty angry about that. I thought, yuck—that's gross. Have you no dignity and respect? Post a picture of him with his family, you know?
