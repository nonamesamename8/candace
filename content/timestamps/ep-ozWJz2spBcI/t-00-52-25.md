## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We get to laugh forever that we made TikTok ban TikTok because TikTok is actually code for Israel. The modern state of TikTok. That's what I want you guys to do, because that would just be funny. And we have to actually have fun because it's getting so crazy. We have to actually have fun and continue to smile and laugh and to be happy warriors for truth.

Anyways, you guys, let me read some more of our sponsors for today before I get into some of your comments. First, I want to tell you guys about PureTalk.

And that's a principle that PureTalk proudly supports. They sponsor my show, which allows me to stand strong behind the microphone every day and share the truth with you.
