## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I live in Dallas, and I noticed after the Ice shooting that Daniel Cato, the Dallas police chief, is new to the role as of April. We are all being lied to."

Exposed to Truth writes, "I have been a Catholic my whole life and attended a non-denominational church once and found it to be cringy like that pastor that you showed the video of. Keep fighting for truth. I'm sure Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) is cheering you on from heaven, praying for you."

But I was upset.
