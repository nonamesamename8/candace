## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> In a world of skincare that's dominated by a lot of foreign brands, Neemi formulates and produces everything here in the USA, and they deliver world-class quality while staying true to the values that they hold dear—which are faith, family, and freedom. So you shouldn't have to compromise your values to get incredible skincare. With Neemi, you certainly don't have to. So as you prepare for the new season, make sure your skin is prepared too. You'll get an exclusive 10% off your order at neemiskincare.com if you use code CANDACE10 at checkout. Support a brand that supports this country and see the results yourself. Again, that's neemiskincare.com with promo code CANDACE10 for 10% off. And I want to remind you guys about American Financing too, because the cost of everything is out of control, and many people are relying on credit cards to cover essentials. If that debt is piling up for you, you should know that you're not alone, first and foremost. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt.
