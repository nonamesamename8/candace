## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I was almost upset with my priest, because I went on Sunday and I expected him to like say something about Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk)—which is not what he should be doing. Like, you can dedicate a Mass to somebody, but he didn't say anything about Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). And I was like, oh—like, I don't like that. And now that I've removed from that, I actually appreciate that. That is what I actually find that I love about the Catholic religion: there's no political bent there. Like, that is what I love. And I attend, you know, the Latin Mass. And what I was upset with, I now really appreciate in retrospect—that you know, there's no drop of politicism when you're in the room. Jennifer Barney writes, "I admire you so much. It's easy to drop something and go with the flow. Don't drop this. Something is not right. Thank you, Candace (Candace Owens), for being our voice." I'm grateful. I'm actually so grateful I can be your voice.
