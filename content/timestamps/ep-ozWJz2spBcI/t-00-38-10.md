## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> People around the world didn't even know Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk), okay? Third thought: "Thank God Trump (Donald Trump) is president"—like MAGA? Did you go MAGA? Did you go like, "I'm glad he knows the Lord," and then MAGA? What are we missing here? Does that feel okay at all? It goes on to say she praises the FBI director, Kash Patel, and his deputy Dan Bongino for their leadership in the hunt for the suspect. "What's so crazy is that we have them in office because of Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk)," Clark said. So honor the feds, quick pic outside, and also MAGA—MAGA hard. That is like—I'm sorry, I get it; everybody grieves differently, okay? But not that way.
