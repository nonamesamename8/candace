## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I saw partially the footage, which means it made it back home, or maybe they had it back home because they were recording it live—whatever it is. It was being live-streamed. But what he said actually conflicts with what Tyler (Tyler Robinson) Bowyer is about to say—what he said over this weekend, okay? Tyler (Tyler Robinson) Bowyer, like I said, he's a COO of Turning Point Action, and he went on this kind of bender—worst kind of bender, Twitter bender—defending the organization. He thought he was defending them against public sentiments, during which time he refutes what Andrew Kolvet is saying about the SD cards. Andrew (Andrew Kolvet) says the Turning Point employee was worried about theft, but Tyler (Tyler Robinson) says that actually he was instructed to secure the SD cards before the campus went on to lockdown.
