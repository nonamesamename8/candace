## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Happy Monday, everybody. Today we are going to discuss, or rather I'm going to introduce to you, a psychological strategy that I refer to as "David hogging." Some of you guys remember David Hogg of the Parkland shooting tragedy. Of course you do. Well, it seems like Turning Point USA is now engaging in this strategy of David hogging the public. And I want it to be clear that it is downright manipulative, and I've really had enough of it. Frankly, what happened over the weekend is that their TP Action COO, Tyler (Tyler Robinson) Bowyer, went on a little bit of an X binge. I don't recommend it, which was then highlighted by Alex Clark, who has a show over there on Instagram.
