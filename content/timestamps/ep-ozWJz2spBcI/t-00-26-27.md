## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, regarding the missing campus footage, there is a user that begged Tyler to file an FOIA request, and that user wrote this: "Please, I beg you, focus on getting the security footage of the sequence pre-jump off the low-seat building where we can see Robinson in shot position and corroborate the story. Like, file an FOIA; get that footage; keep it simple." And he responds and he says, "Guys, there's camera footage all over that campus that the police have, plus all the cameras that we had. They likely won't release it until the trial." Now there's just one problem with that narrative, right? If they have all this footage and they're just not releasing it because they just want to—what?
