## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> a full attack—like full attack mode—against me when I very casually—you guys watching this series, very casually—mentioned that Catholics were hoping that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was going to take the next step and convert. Like, of course, I'm Catholic. Of course, what would be wrong with me sharing that? Everybody was sharing their stories about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and the conversations they were having. But for some reason, Candace (Candace Owens) saying—and I'll sum it up, effectively it was like two sentences: "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was going through some spiritual changes towards the end. Catholics were hoping that he'd take the next step because he was praying the rosary." I never said he converted, because he didn't. That would have been dishonest. But people were somehow really angry. Somebody clearly hit the panic button. Suddenly a bunch of videos were being made disputing the narrative.
