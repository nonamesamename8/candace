She says, 'The very first thought that popped into my head was, I'm so glad that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) knew Jesus,' said Clark, 32, who hosts the MAGA-friendly podcast Culture Apothecary for Turning Point USA. The second thought was, 'What will happen now?' And the third thought was, 'Thank God Trump (Donald Trump) is president.'" I don't know. You?
