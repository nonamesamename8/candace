She says, 'The very first thought that popped into my head was, I'm so glad that Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) knew Jesus,' said Clark, 32, who hosts the MAGA-friendly podcast Culture Apothecary for Turning Point USA. The second thought was, 'What will happen now?' And the third thought was, 'Thank God Trump (Donald Trump) is president.'" I don't know. You?
