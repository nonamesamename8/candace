## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Lastly, I want to tell you guys about The Wellness Company because did you know that most methylene blue that's being sold online right now is actually the same grade that's being used in fish tanks, which is pretty gross? You need to watch out for low-quality bottles that are untested for heavy metals and made overseas. You can trust, however, The Wellness Company's Recharge, which is a doctor-formulated supplement combining powdered methylene blue with NAD+ and PQQ. This methylene blue is USP grade, ensuring top-tier purity for maximum safety and effectiveness. This is not the sketchy stuff you will find on Amazon. Recharge is formulated with research-backed ingredients to optimize brain function and cellular repair while supporting clean, lasting energy.
