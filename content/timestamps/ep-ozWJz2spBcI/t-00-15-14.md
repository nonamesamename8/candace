## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Why did he decide to post this after I revealed that Hamptons meeting? Well, you should know—I think most people do—that both his son and his daughter-in-law work for Turning Point USA. So whether you want to represent that or not, they have a financial stake in the future of the company. He heads up the faith division. So Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) faith and what direction it was going into would actually matter, right? It would actually matter if Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—and I never said he was going to—decided one day to become Catholic. It would have financial implications, to be clear. I never had a conversation that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was in the process of converting. Okay. But Rob in particular knew for an absolute fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was done with Israel bullying him.
