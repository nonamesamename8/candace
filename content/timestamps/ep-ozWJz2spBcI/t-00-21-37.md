## Transcript

**Andrew Kolvet:**

One of our dear friends that literally from the very beginning started with us and loved Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) like a brother—he grabbed the SD cards out of the camera afterwards. And there's all these conspiracy videos about, 'Why did he grab the SD cards?' Well, first of all, they're in the possession of the FBI. Okay. It's not like he took them and like ran off with them. Second of all, I asked him personally. I said, 'Why did you do that?' And he looked at me, and this was his answer. He said, 'Because I know people can be evil,' and he did not want that footage being grabbed by somebody. There was videos of people after the incident going and stealing hats off the table.
