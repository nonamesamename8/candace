## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> To be clear, I might actually release a name every day this week, but I want to show you this because, suffice it to say, Rob McCoy was on this text thread. And I think it helps contextualize him as a person—in my view—that he would attack me for telling the truth about the pressure that he was facing. Take a look. (Group chat clip:) So Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) writes in this group chat, "Just lost another huge Jewish donor—two million a year—because we won't cancel Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I'm thinking of inviting Candace (Candace (Candace Owens) Owens)." Somebody writes, "Oh." Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) writes, "Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes. I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause."
