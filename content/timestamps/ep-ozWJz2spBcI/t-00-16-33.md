## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> To be clear, I might actually release a name every day this week, but I want to show you this because, suffice it to say, Rob McCoy was on this text thread. And I think it helps contextualize him as a person—in my view—that he would attack me for telling the truth about the pressure that he was facing. Take a look. (Group chat clip:) So Charlie (Charlie Kirk) writes in this group chat, "Just lost another huge Jewish donor—two million a year—because we won't cancel Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I'm thinking of inviting Candace (Candace Owens)." Somebody writes, "Oh." Charlie (Charlie Kirk) writes, "Jewish donors play into all of the stereotypes. I cannot and will not be bullied like this, leaving me no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause."
