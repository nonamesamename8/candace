## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We talked about it a lot, and I was thrilled—like I said—and I was being honest that he was attending Mass, okay? But I want to again state that Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) was not attending Rob McCoy's church. He was attending Mass, so it registered to me again as somewhat disingenuous when Pastor Rob McCoy came out and effectively asked me to—you know—stop looking into all of the things that happened in the lead-up to Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk's (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk's) assassination, or at least asking me to pause it—rather, would be more fair of an interpretation—until the memorial, right? I'm going to jog your memory here. Here is what Pastor Rob McCoy (Pastor Rob McCoy) wrote on his Instagram after I exposed the now infamous Hamptons meeting which took place. (Pastor Rob McCoy clip:) He wrote this: "Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) was my friend, and I was his pastor.
