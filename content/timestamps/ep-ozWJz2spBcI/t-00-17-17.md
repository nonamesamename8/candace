## Transcript

> Then somebody writes—Sedona writes—"Please do not invite Candace (Candace (Candace Owens) Owens). That might feel good short term, but it's not good long term. In my opinion, like all groups, you're going to get a wide variety of opinions. That nasty free will thing that God bestowed on us makes life frustrating at times. After the dust settles a bit, maybe." So again, this is 48 hours before Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk's (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk's) assassination.

I'm not going to reveal the names of the other seven. Actually, you know what? I disagree with myself four seconds ago. Let's just throw in Josh Hammer, for funsies. He's on this chat, okay. So what are we to make of that?
