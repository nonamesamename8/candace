## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, we should act like it at all times, which is why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. $28 is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in a crisis and considering abortion. So for just $28, you can help her see the life inside of her. You can give her truth that the culture most definitively will not. So you shouldn't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. Be unapologetically pro-life. Go to preborn.org/Candace right now. Give $28. You can also give 10 times that amount if you can. This is the line that I think that we have to stand on. We have to stand for truth and what is right. We have to save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace. Provide an ultrasound for $28.
