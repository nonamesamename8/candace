## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And so it's interesting, to say the least, but similarly, within Judaism, there are different sects. There just are. And we don't realize that. We don't know what they believe in. We just go, "Oh, well, it's Judaism. It's the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible." No. There's also the Talmud. There's also the Kabbalah. And to just not actually study and understand all of those differences—it makes us extremely ignorant and very likely to be indoctrinated into one of those religions, convinced that it's actually modern science—which is what's actually happening, I think. We kind of live in a Kabbalist society more than anything else. And I think that this book that we're going to read will help you get there. We really have—we go there in the book club. We go there. And so if you'd like to join the book club, we're starting a new book tomorrow.
