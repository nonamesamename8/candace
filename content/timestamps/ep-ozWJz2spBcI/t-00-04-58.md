## Transcript

That's what I mean when I say they are David hogging us, okay. You could also use another example: somebody that was on the right, Kyle Kashuv. What it essentially means is that when a tragedy takes place and we are all—we are emotional, our emotions are raw—me especially. I think this was the first time where I couldn't really check my emotions. I'm just now like moving out of the grief stage.
