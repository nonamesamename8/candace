## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, now that I'm showing you this and showing to you that the conversations were real, I want you to reflect. And it took me a lot of patience to allow the lies that were being woven and the misrepresentations of people that were pretending that I was just—what?—high on lying about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and the pressure he was under, the attacks that not just me—Tucker (Tucker Carlson), Megyn Kelly—faced for trying to stand up and tell the truth about what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was actually going through. Why are you hearing it, though, from me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and Megyn Kelly? Is that weird? You got people that are hosting a show. Have they in like one honorable thing come out and said like, "You know what? F a couple of these donors who made his life a living hell in the last couple of weeks"? Why haven't they done that?
