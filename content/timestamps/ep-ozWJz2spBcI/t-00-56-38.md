## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They think we're dumb and like it's all happening organically. It's like—it's just tiresome. It's really tiresome. So if I have a take on everybody so we can get some truth, then that's what it is. That's just what it is. Jennifer Orchison writes, "Praying for your safety, Candace (Candace (Candace Owens) Owens). Keep digging, please. You are onto something. We need truth." Thank you, Jennifer. That is a massive donation. I really, really appreciate that. All of you guys that have been donating to the show to support us—like, I just want you to know that we really appreciate it, and we see it. Melissa Forberg, similarly, with a really nice donation here: "Spent the weekend researching the Kabbalah. It was, to say the absolute least, terrifying. Thank you." Yes, it is very important. Of course, if you are in my book club, we're about to really get into it, by the way.
