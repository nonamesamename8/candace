## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I want to simply say this regarding Candace (Candace Owens). Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was a friend to Candace (Candace Owens) and never publicly spoke poorly of her, although he disagreed with her. He never operated nor entertained gossip or innuendo concerning Candace (Candace Owens). My only comment I offer regarding Candace (Candace Owens) is this: I only wish that at this tragic time of mourning, she would be the friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) that he was to her. He would never have treated Candace (Candace Owens) or her family in such a way had—God forbid—this tragedy been hers. A friend loves at all times. Proverbs." Now, I want to be very clear. If Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a friend of mine, I sure hope if I was assassinated in front of the world that he would raise hell to figure out what actually took place on that day. That's not being a friend. A friend is not someone who stays silent when lies are being told by the federal government. That's not a friend. Again, emotionally manipulative.
