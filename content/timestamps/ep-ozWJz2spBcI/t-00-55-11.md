## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You might have considered reaching out to my friends over at American Financing, but maybe you hesitated because you don't want to give up that low mortgage rate that you're enjoying. Well, you should know that there is good news, because they've created the Smart Equity Loan—which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC—rather, which can have varied interest rates— the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment—which will give you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off your high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started with no upfront or hidden fees. Call American Financing and start saving now. Call 800-795-1210. That's 800-795-1210.
