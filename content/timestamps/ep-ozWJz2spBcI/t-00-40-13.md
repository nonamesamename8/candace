## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I didn't read the paragraph where he announced that Justin Strife would be the COO, but we read the entirety related to the DOJ department. And here's what Tyler (Tyler Robinson) says about that: (Tyler (Tyler Robinson) Bowyer tweet quote:) "She took a sentence and made something up. TPUSA does an audit every year—always has. Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) constantly looked for ways to make everything we do more efficient. That's TPUSA. It operates eight times more effectively than any other similar operation."

Why would he call it new if he was doing it every year? And wow, what foresight you had as a company that's been around for like 10 years or more—maybe more than 10 years—that you were doing DOJ since the beginning?
