## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> These are all indisputable facts. And it is also a fact, which was presented by Megyn Kelly, that a few weeks before his death, Erika (Erika Kirk) had a priest come over to pray over them when some witches thought it would be funny—whatever—to put a hex on him. Okay. That's a lot of things that were happening behind the scenes. And the people at Turning Point USA knew those things to be true. Okay, they knew everything that I just shared with you; they knew for a fact. So I was a bit astonished when Andrew Kolvet and Alex Clark similarly jumped in, in this inauthentic attempt to dissuade the idea that Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) was softening on Catholicism.
