## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Another one of these talking points they're coming out with is: people are doing this for clicks. They're motivated by money. Do you guys understand the tens of millions of dollars that Turning Point USA made in the two weeks following Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk's (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk's) assassination? It would be insane for a person to suggest that if a random guy on YouTube catches a million views discussing ballistics—which there have been many gun guys who have done videos on ballistics and caught a million views—that that's somehow immoral because they're maybe gonna make $10,000 if they keep that up for an entire month. Like, that is insane. It actually relies on financial illiteracy to think that that's immoral. Good for them. Good for them.
