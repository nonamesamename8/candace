## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I spoke to that Turning Point individual, as I told you, and he never once mentioned that police officers—I explicitly asked him, "Why did you take the SD cards out specifically of the camera behind Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk)'s head?" And the answer that I was given sounded more like what Andrew Kolvet said. "You know, I was emotional. I knew that Charlie (Charlie (Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk) Kirk) was dead. And my instinct," he told me, "was to make sure that I secured the footage so that Erika (Erika Kirk) would not have to see it again. Like, he didn't want Erika (Erika Kirk) to have to see it and have to relive it." That is what he said to me on the phone. Nothing about police officers. No one's ever heard "Police officers asked them to secure the footage before lockdown" until Tyler (Tyler Robinson) Bowyer tweeted this weekend. I don't like it, okay? I just don't like it.
