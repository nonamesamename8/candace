## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> They're saving people just like you an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in the low fives—which is a complete game-changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. And if you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you that extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before we know it, so don't wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today. You can call American Financing at 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or you can visit AmericanFinancing.net/Candace Owens. AmericanFinancing.net/Candace Owens. All right, you guys. Some housekeeping.
