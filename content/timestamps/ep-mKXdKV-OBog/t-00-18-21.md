## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> As I've reviewed this footage, and any time that I think that somebody is shady or somebody is brought to my attention that is involved or I would like more information on, they happen to be wearing a maroon shirt. Have you guys noted this? Everybody that day—I know, look, everybody's liberal, and guys wear pink, and Abercrombie's a thing—but I have never in my life looked at—every guy seems to be wearing maroon. I'm like, "Who is this guy?" Oh, he's wearing a maroon shirt. Oh, he's wearing a maroon shirt. Tyler Robinson—everyone's wearing a maroon shirt—as if they were told to wear maroon shirts to identify each other. I'm communicating this to you because it keeps coming up in my research, and I think it means something.
