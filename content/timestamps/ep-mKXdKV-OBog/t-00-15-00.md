## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This is our guy who happened to be a pilot who did his residency at an Air Force base. Oh, okay, that's interesting. We told you that Deidre Amaro—Dr. Deidre Amaro—is the medical examiner, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s medical examiner, who they've curiously not wanted to address publicly. Yeah, I told you she's also a major in the military. Oh, who would have thunk it? Andrew Kolvet—obviously, his brother and his cousin are captains in the military. That's a fact. Frank Turk, who's there for the assassination, is a naval flight officer. His sons are in the Air Force. That's a fact. McCoys—naval intelligence, background in psychological operations because of granddad, and famed—actually, is granted the McCoys fame.
