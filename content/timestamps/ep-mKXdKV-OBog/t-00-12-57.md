## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I wanna say to my Nebraskans, we should probably figure out—I didn't have time to do this—we should go through a schedule and see who we met with, because I feel like that idea might be related to our planes. I just don't think people in Nebraska are sitting around like, "Hey, we should go to Cairo or Egypt," and it happens to line up with this plane that comes in—literally comes in on the exact same day. And also minor correction: I think yesterday I said that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) spoke on July 18th; he actually spoke on July 11th. I just kind of copy-and-pasted that wrong, so we made that correction. Anyways, yeah, we can then see that we've added this addition.
