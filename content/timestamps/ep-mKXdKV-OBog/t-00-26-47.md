## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Jonathan spent 30 years in prison on espionage charges after being found to have pretended to work for the American government but was actually working to pass documents over to Israel. That's kind of a theme. Our greatest ally. It's just a theme with our greatest ally. And despite being found guilty—despite spending 30 years in prison—people were saying we should be kinder to this guy, and Huckabee was among several pro-Israel politicians who advocated for Jonathan Pollard to be released. And when he was released, was welcomed in Israel—the red carpet was rolled out for him, I think, literally. And I think Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) met him on the runway like, "You served us well." You've served us well.
