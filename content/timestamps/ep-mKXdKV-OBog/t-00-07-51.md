And we can show you right here that in the weeks leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination—I mean, literally what he says—August 24th-29th, Operation Valhalla took place in neighboring Minnesota. So they took the Minot boys, and they took them over to Minnesota, and it included the military and—of note—the civilians. What's interesting: of note, civilians. And they trained from August 25th to August 29th. And we can read the details of that here.
