## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's supposed to make us think that there was actually someone on that rooftop. Then there's the video—the other, the second video—which is the guy laying down before the shots, right? That also was recorded by a person in the military who actually teaches shooting. So this is not a military campus, guys. Burton Hibbs—Butch—the brother of Pastor Jack Hibbs. Jack Hibbs phones up Charlie (Charlie Kirk); he's like, "Hey, can my brother come? Can my brother come and listen to you speak?" I guess this—whatever—it was a hotbed. Older people just love Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in Utah. Very hard to find a student that was just, you know, on campus that day who went to hear Charlie (Charlie Kirk) speak—probably because they barely advertised this event for a reason.
