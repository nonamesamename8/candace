## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> There was like a fleet of ships named after the McCoys—very high up military. The video—the only two videos that we have that were recorded allegedly of the shooter: first and foremost, the video of him running away after the shot—way too fast. If he was actually crouched down shooting—common sense—it's too fast. You couldn't be in sprint that quickly for anybody that's actually fired a rifle. You know that you can't go from a crouching position to a full sprint in a split second. Well, that video was recorded by a person that is in the ROTC. I hunted that person down—very strange. They didn't want to be involved and sent it through three people to release onto the internet. And then it is boosted. And that's the video that everybody sees.
