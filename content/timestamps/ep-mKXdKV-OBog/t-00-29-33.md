## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> His name is Ashley Reinsberg. And this is—I'm just going to read you the email. This is it. It says, "Hi, Candace (Candace Owens). I'm reporting a piece for The Free Press on the economics. Ooh, economics. I like economics. This must be straight middle-of-the-line, right? There can't be any bias here. I'm reporting a piece for The Free Press on the economics of high-engagement political content on YouTube and podcast platforms. I'm reaching out for comment regarding several assertions that you've made in recent episodes, including claims about Israel, the death of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and the Becoming Brigitte series. I also want to ask about the financial side of your operation because it is central to the story." Here are his five questions.
