## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I mean, it has to be something or someone that is so powerful globally that they have the ability to strike fear into the heart of American politics—meaning that they are willing to tell lies to the American people: such absurd lies to the American people like Kash would tell: the leaders of our government are lying to us and telling us not to believe our own eyes. So whatever that is that is sitting behind them— yeah, that's power. Okay. It's got to be generational power. That's not—that's not "Hey, I'm new here and trying this thing out." Melissa B. writes: "I really, really want to believe that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is in witness protection—that the FBI and the POTUS set it up to catch Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu). Christ is King will always be king. Love you."
