## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. Happy Friday. Some more interesting tips are coming in. It seems that that company, Satis—that French company—the Satis angle has opened up a whole new level of possibilities here in this Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination story. And I have to tell you, I do not think that they were just painting planes this year. Rather, we've learned that just before Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, there was actually this joint military exercise—which was taking place—related exactly to where the Egyptian yellow plane landed on its way to Provo. We need to definitely keep at it. Zionists are mad. I don't know why this investigation really has set Zionists off.
