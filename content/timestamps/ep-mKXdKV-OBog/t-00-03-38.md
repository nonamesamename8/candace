## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Of course, that didn't stop Brutus from plunging the knife into him. 23 times Julius Caesar was stabbed by senators, and of course Brutus, leading to the famed Shakespearean expression: "Et tu, Brute?" Et tu—you as well, you too? Wow, you have turned against me as well. Now, why was Caesar assassinated? Because—I don't know—he was too good, too adored, too respected by the people, thereby a threat somehow to the establishment, the establishment of politics. It doesn't like to see somebody come through the ranks and achieve what they perceive to be power that they can't control.
