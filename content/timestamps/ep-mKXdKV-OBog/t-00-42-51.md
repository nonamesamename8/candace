## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I can tell you that that is not at all what happened. I know people were saying that—like Valhalla used to be a program out in New Zealand. Guys, if you can look it up and figure out that it's a program in New Zealand, it's not a good program, right? So that's like the most hopeful wish that I think all of us wanted to. I definitely looked at Facebook; I was like, "I just hope he's alive, and none of this is real." And I had to then contend with the fact that it's very real. And that was obviously in large part due to my contacts that saw Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s body and can't deny that. L of the Wanger writes: "I lost the cringe challenge." What? You didn't like "Sweet Home Jerusalem"? No? Weird.
