## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Before we get to what he had to say about Bari Weiss, I want to remind you that Bari Weiss started and is a part-owner, at least, of The Free Press before that—before she went on to CBS News. She notoriously left The New York Times and said it was biased, and we needed to have something that was in the middle of the line, and she just couldn't get behind all of this COVID propaganda, and she was gonna start The Free Press, and they were gonna go back to doing hardcore, real, non-biased journalism. So what kind of journalism are they doing over at The Free Press, okay? This is a real email. I'm not being funny. I feel like you're gonna think this is SNL that fluttered into my inbox the other day from a writer.
