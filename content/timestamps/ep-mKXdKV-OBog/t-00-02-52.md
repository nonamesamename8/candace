## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Man, that sure is something to hear him say that. The people who benefited the most turned against him. Gaius Julius Caesar—that is correct—a general who had rightfully earned the respect of the people for leading them through the Gallic Wars, a statesman, and finally a leader who in the end was betrayed and famously assassinated by the very people that he helped to build up: a conspiracy, a plot to murder him, which included a lot of people—politicians, of course, the senators, military men, close friends and confidants—the most infamous, of course, being Brutus. Now, some reports say that he viewed Brutus as a son. That's how close they were.
