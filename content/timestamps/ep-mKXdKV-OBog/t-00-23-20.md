## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> For just $28—that's what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion. You can help her see the light that is growing inside of her to give her the truth that the culture will not. Do not sit this one out. Do not wait for permission. Be bold, be clear, and be unapologetically pro-life. You can head to preborn.org/Candace right now. You can give $28. You can give 10 times that if you can. This is the line that we have to stand on. We have to stand for truth and fight for what's right. We have to save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace. Provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also want to remind you guys about Tax Network USA because if you owe the IRS back taxes, they can garnish your wages and levy your bank accounts.
