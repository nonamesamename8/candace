> because I'm getting the sense that they hold the key to solving Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. The media keeps trying these weird ways to debunk them. And we're going to find out. I've been confident from the beginning that this was not going to be a JFK assassination story.

It is a very important question that needs answering. Got to tell you guys that we received another email this time from somebody in the military who informed us about another piece that we were missing that could be crucial to this puzzle.
