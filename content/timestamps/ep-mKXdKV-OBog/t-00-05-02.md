I've been confident from the beginning that this was not going to be a JFK assassination story. We are going to figure out who that foreign dignitary was who went to 920 North King on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination—who flew from Provo and landed into Wilmington, Delaware, on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination.
