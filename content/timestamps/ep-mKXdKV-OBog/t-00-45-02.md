## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> One, Antonio writes: "This Thanksgiving, hug the friends of the family that you once dismissed or hounded for not voting or for being conspiracy theorists. If you're waking up to how things really work, show them love when you see them." Yes, and you definitely should do that because I think we're all seeing that the conspiracies are real left and right—by the way—that people were telling the truth at various times and that there is great tremendous evil; that much of this is a matrix; the system is rigged; it is not fair. And it can only stay rigged if we keep arguing with one another. Grayscout Epsilon writes: "How are American politicians able to act on behalf of a foreign nation against its own citizens and not be considered treasonous?" Because everything is fake and gay.
