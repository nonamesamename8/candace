## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Amber Robinson—there's just photos of them visiting—and Uncle Mitchell. Is this the Mitchell that allegedly convinced him to turn himself in, who's working? He's very much involved in the military. I believe with shooting in Ukraine, of all places. It's getting shady. And of course, our now infamous planes, SUBTT and SUBNT, are Egyptian military planes. And every plane that seems to be flying over UVU that day is somehow military-contracted planes. So are we supposed to think that this is all by coincidence? Or are we looking at an obvious military operation? And here's something else that I want to share with you.
