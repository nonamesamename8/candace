## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Again, not saying this person has done anything wrong. But unusually, when I went to check that person's socials, they had posted on September 10th about their bulletproof skateboard—that I don't know if it was like a promo for his skateboard or whatever it was—but didn't do any follow-up posts about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Nobody in his family posted about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You had a front-row seat, and you watched Charlie (Charlie Kirk) die. And I guess no social posts about it—wasn't interested, maybe wanted to stay out of it. And then I obviously find out that his dad is the head of—and I hope I'm saying that correctly—president of the Mormon temple in Los Angeles.
