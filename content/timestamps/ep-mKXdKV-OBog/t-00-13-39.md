## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They have this joint operation, Valhalla, that's taking place at Camp Ripley, and we are really getting tight here. We are talking about T minus 12 days until Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is going to be assassinated. And here's what I hope you guys are seeing here—why I have said this was so clearly a military operation. Everything about this story is military, okay? We are receiving tips, and we had been receiving tips I had ignored previously that the French Foreign Legion was involved somehow in the assassination. Time will tell, okay? And I will present that more formally when I feel like we have concrete evidence.
