## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Probably just a coincidence, you guys, that this operation also fits just so neatly into our timeline. I love timelines. I love neat timelines. So let's pull that up again. I'm also gonna introduce a couple of corrections to yesterday. First and foremost, July 20th, we talked about SUBTT, which came in for its longest trip—that's correct—from Cairo. It went through to Paris, and then it went to Omaha, Nebraska. I think yesterday I said that it stayed in Wilmington for six days. No, it only stayed in Wilmington for one night. It stayed in Nebraska for the longest stretch yet, departing from Lincoln, Nebraska, in particular.
