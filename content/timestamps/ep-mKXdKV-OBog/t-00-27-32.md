## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And who cares if the American people suffer? So you'd think Mike Huckabee would go, "I'm not going to meet with him because that shows that I am an Israel-first star." But there is just a level of shamelessness that I don't know. What was it that Karoline Leavitt said? They asked Karoline Leavitt about this at the White House, and she said—and I quote—"The White House was not aware of that meeting, but the president stands by our ambassador." Well said, Karoline. I mean, "I didn't know he was going to meet with a traitor, but we stand by him anyway if he's meeting a traitor." And the reason we stand by him is because we're all traitors. We are all treasonous. I hate everyone. I hate that this is allowed.
