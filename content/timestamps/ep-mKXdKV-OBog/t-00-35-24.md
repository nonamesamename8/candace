## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Okay, you guys. You have heard me speak a lot about Neeme Skin Care. I love what their three-step anti-aging routine has done for my skin, which is why I am very excited that Neeme Skin Care now has a complete body line as well. They have the Foundations Body Bundle. It's a simple three-step routine. You get the Botanical Bliss Body Wash, which gently cleanses with soothing botanicals; revitalizing sugar scrub to exfoliate and hydrate with vitamin C plus the coconut oil; and the restorative body lotion to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy. And just like the facial care, the Neeme body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients. And best of all, it's made right here in the USA by a company that is built on our values: faith, family, and of course, freedom. So finally, you can stop supporting the radical corporations and give your money to a company that actually honors you.
