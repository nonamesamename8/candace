## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Why stop there at all on the fourth? Why not fly direct to Provo? Not only does Minot have an FBI office, but it also has an Air Force base among other tenants. That Air Force base is home to the 891st Missile Security Forces Squadron, a combined military and civilian security force that had just come off of Operation Valhalla, a training exercise in Minnesota from the 24th to the 29th of August, where the security forces practice long-range shooting practice, among other things. Remember on September 12th when Kash Patel ended his press conference with quote, "Lastly, to my friend Charlie (Charlie Kirk), rest now, my brother. We have the watch, and I'll see you in Valhalla."
