## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Taking a more serious look into that one-hour layover stop when our yellow plane, SUBTT—the tail number—came into the United States on September 4th. You might recall it stopped for just one hour in Minot, North Dakota, which I learned has an Air Force base. It pretty much is just the Air Force base, by the way, before making its way onto Provo. And here I'm going to read to you that email that I received. It says, "Hi, Candace (Candace Owens), I am [blank]. One of the good ones—military member, one of the good ones. I think one of the keys to not overlook here is SUBTT's stopover in Minot, North Dakota.
