## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Their Foundations Body Bundle: it's a simple three-step routine. You get the Botanical Bliss body wash, the revitalizing sugar scrub, and the restorative body lotion with hyaluronic acid to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy—and just like their facial skincare, the Nimi body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients. And best of all: it's made right here in the USA by a company built on our values—faith, family, and of course freedom. Finally, you can stop supporting radical corporations and give your money to a company that actually honors you. It's time to care for all of your skin with products that you can trust. So head to mimiskincare.com and use my code CANDACE10 at checkout for 10% off your entire order.
