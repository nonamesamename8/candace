## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I have no sympathy for Mikey McCoy. I have no sympathy for Tyler Bowyer. I—yeah—I think telling the truth is a very easy thing to do when you have a microphone. And if you don't want to tell the truth, it just makes you look more suspicious. And I can give you an example of that. There was some kid who was wearing green at this UVU event, right? They looked kind of shady. There was a ton of rumors. We got a bunch of emails, but I never covered it on the show because I didn't think there was anything beyond the fact that he looked kind of shady in a green hoodie. And I think it was yesterday Sam Parker was like, "Who are these guys?" And: "I can't get a clear image of this person." I then respond to him like, "Here's a clear image of this person."
