## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I'm wondering if this is just kind of like Zionist nastiness. I think I've been extremely gracious to the different perspectives that we have if we are all committed to truth.

I'm happy to do that and bring the evidence of what I'm saying. That always stands open. You will have a platform if you are committed to truth. My platform is your platform.
