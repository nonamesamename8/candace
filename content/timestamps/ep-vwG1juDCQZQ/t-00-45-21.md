## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm wondering if this is just kind of like Zionist nastiness. I think I've been extremely gracious to the different perspectives that we have if we are all committed to truth. We are obviously able to debate, and I'm happy—by the way; I'll add this as well—to have Allie or Lila Rose on this show tomorrow if you guys would like to—to debate what I have presented thus far in addition to me telling you how Turning Point USA operates their events. I'm happy to do that and bring the evidence of what I'm saying. That always stands open. You will have a platform if you are committed to truth. My platform is your platform. Now, speaking of PR and people who should maybe get into it: Alex Clark needs a raise.
