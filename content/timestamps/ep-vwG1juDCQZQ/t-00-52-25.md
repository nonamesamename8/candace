## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I will not be apologizing for what I said. Come forth with the truth—or don't, okay? And if you don't, we're just gonna keep investigating and see how you feel about it. Take a quick break, and I'll get to some of your comments. All right, you guys: I want to remind you about Paleovalley because something my team and I are always craving are their beef sticks—specifically the ones that they make with 100% grass-fed beef sourced from small-scale regenerative American farms—so you can feel good about what you're eating and what you're supporting. They've stripped out all the junk, so there are no preservatives, gluten, soy, sugar, dairy, or GMOs—just clean, nutrient-dense fuel the way that food was meant to be. So whether you are road-tripping, working late, or running around with the kids, these sticks deliver high-protein energy without the crash. Whether you're keto, paleo, carnivore—it does not matter.
