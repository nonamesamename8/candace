## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I think this is a pretty exciting opportunity. And so I don't understand why we just can't get basic answers about Mikey McCoy that would allow us to just move on from how we are feeling about his behavior following things—and the things that were said about him following things—which make us feel like they were priming him to take over for Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And we heard these things from his father. We heard these things from people at Turning Point USA. And if you're looking for a fact: he took over for Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—who was slated to speak at Liberty University. Okay, that's just a fact. Alex Clark also threw shade at us, and it's kind of incredible that she said this working for Turning Point USA.
