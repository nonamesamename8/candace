## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And one of the things that we are speaking truth about right now—and which my haters are like—is it's because you're talking about Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You know, you guys change this every month. First it was, "Oh, it's because of the Brigitte Macron thing." "Oh, it's because of the Kamala Chronicles." "Oh, it's because of the Blake Lively lawsuit." The common denominator here is me looking for truth. And I think people are catching on to the fact that I'm sincerely looking for truth, and I don't care what enemies I make along the way. And obviously I'm making a lot of enemies right now for some reason looking into the Charlie Kirk assassination and the lies that we are being told. Anyways, let's get into Erika Kirk. Obviously it was a very anticipated interview. I think we didn't really know what we were going to get.
