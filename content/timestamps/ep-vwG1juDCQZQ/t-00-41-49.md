## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Because it meant there were gonna be protests. They will burn you in effigy—as they did to Michael Knowles at a Turning Point USA event. So there has to be certain parameters that are set to allow these particular events to happen. But I appreciate you sharing your experience. And the next time Taylor Swift tweets about her experience, I'm going to just be like, "Not true. Not true to Taylor Swift." It's like: "I—you know—I can't walk into the mall." I mean, like: me neither. That's not true. I walked in. No fans ran up at me, Taylor Swift. So obviously Taylor Swift's lying because it didn't happen to me. It doesn't. As Justin Bieber says: it's just—it's not clocking for us, man. Anyways, it is weird to me also that when you look at what they focus on, it seems so petty—but then they look over all of the glaringly obvious lies that were being told about this investigation.
