## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> (Erika Kirk clip): It's so easy to be in a position of feeling regret when you lose someone you love. And I tried to read a book by C.S. Lewis because he lost the love of his life. He was only married to her for four years. It's called A Grief Observed. It was a very hard book to read, not because it was about grief, but because in the opening pages he talked about how angry he was with God. And I've never felt that. I'm not angry with God. Never have I.
