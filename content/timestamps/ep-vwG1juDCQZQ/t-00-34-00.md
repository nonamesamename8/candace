## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> eight semesters with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), like in a row. It's never happened that a college makes a request over the summer when school is closed—because it was, okay, at the end of July; school was not in session. And then it gets honored by Turning Point USA immediately. And then it's on the calendar. Could you imagine the university getting that email? They already hate Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), and they're gonna honor it and be like: "Not only do we wanna honor this; we'll give you the first week back to school." Like, that's what they're telling us, and it doesn't make any sense. And I pointed that out, and I showed proof of that. What are you disagreeing with actually?
