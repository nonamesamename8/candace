## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He felt like St. Michael was his armor. Okay, now I wanted to point that out because in retrospect I get more and more just amazed and upset at how vicious and cruel and unnecessary people are. Just all of the videos people made when I wasn't even mentioning it as a big deal. I was doing a tribute video to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and being like, "We were all hoping that he was going to take the step and become Catholic." Gave no details. And the next thing I knew, Operation Christian Zionist Influencer was—while I was in a state of trauma and grieving—coming after me and saying that it wasn't true. And I don't think any of them have made videos since clarifying that, no, Candace seems to have been telling the truth—because who cares about the truth when you can just dunk on Candace? But I thought that was a very natural way to kind of respond to it.
