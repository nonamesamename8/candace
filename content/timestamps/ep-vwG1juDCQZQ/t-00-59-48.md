## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> She can see what evidence they actually have and what they're posing their case upon. Everything we have seen has just been—I don't know—it's just—it's been one big nothing burger. Tom Paul writes: "Andrew Kolvet on Alex Clark show discussed how Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) heart was still beating. How did Charlie (Charlie Kirk) instantly go to heaven if he had a pulse? Erika first saw Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at an airport in Israel in May of 2018 with her mom. There is an old video of her talking about it." Yeah, I think I saw that video. I think they spoke about that even in other videos they'd done together. I think I was with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), by the way. That might have been for the embassy opening. I don't remember anything, though, in my memory. I promise: after having children, I can't remember specific things. I always have to go back and check an email.
