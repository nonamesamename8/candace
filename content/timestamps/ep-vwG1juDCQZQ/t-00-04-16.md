## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Even though I didn't do nothing—I literally didn't do nothing—but I'm banned. And guess what? You got to hear me anyways. Ha ha ha, Tony Burke. Okay, but in reality, also obviously thanking this incredible team—very small. It has stayed small. There's just four of us that work on the actual podcast every day. Savannah wearing a ton of hats, Chris in editing, Mark mansplaining and also being our director, Skylar the producer who has to deal with my insane text messages all through the night because my brain is running a million different ways. It's just a really tiny little engine that keeps going. And so that's why we are actually resilient. We do need to hire more people. And you guys still are not getting a window in there. I just want to be clear. I don't want them to get too excited. There will never be any breathing room in the control room.
