## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So you are taking a real risk. Go speak to your families and see if that's something that you want to do." And they said yes. And now we're the number one podcast in the world. So they took a chance on me, and we've busted our butts—and here's where we're at. So thank you guys for supporting us on this journey to my original Stan's Cup owners—the first white "Christ is King" Stan's Cup. I see you; I love you guys. You guys were here early, and I've been on this journey. And so that feels good as well. I don't know what I'll say other than book club people—everybody that signed up on the website, candaceowens.com. And we didn't know what we were doing. Just: I love you.
