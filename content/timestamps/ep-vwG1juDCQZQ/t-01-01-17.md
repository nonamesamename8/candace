## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The people have spoken, and we choose truth and light over lies and darkness. Christ is King." Gang. I really do love that it feels like we are in a moment of truth and light. A lot is being revealed. It can feel stressful. It is certainly frustrating—especially for me—to have myself constantly taken out of context and to have people just so willfully lying about me telling the truth. But I do know that there's just something else happening spiritually right now, and we are all barreling toward the light. I really do feel that way. The demons shriek the loudest when they are in the light. Brad Atkins writes: "Praying for you in South Carolina. The Lord Jesus Christ is King."
