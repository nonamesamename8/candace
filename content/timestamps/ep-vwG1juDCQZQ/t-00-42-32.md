## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like, they're not making videos going, "Oh, hey, yeah: spoke to like 10 hunters, and a .30-06 should have decapitated him." They don't care about any of that stuff. So are you doing this because you care about Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Are you doing this because you care about the investigation? Because if you're going to investigate, investigate. Okay. Send me a text message and ask me a specific question and say, "Where'd you get this information from?" Join the team of people online who I never knew before this—who are investigating this murder and using sources. Do that. Either join us or get out of our way—is what I would say—because if you're not going to make a video—or you are going to make a video about a glaring obvious hole and then just pooh-pooh it—which is kind of what Allie did regarding the fed Discord messages.
