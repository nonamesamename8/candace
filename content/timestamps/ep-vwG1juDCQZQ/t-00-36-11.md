## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> two dates that can possibly work—and they're going to get back to them and confirm and see who's available. They did not start planning that event when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) texted you. I can guarantee you that, okay? They did not receive a request from those campuses on that day. It's an absurdity. I don't even know what we're debating. She then follows it up, and she says this: "Since some of you guys are struggling"—because people pointed out that's not what Candace said. It's a request that went from UVU chapter to Turning Point USA. She says: "Some of you guys are struggling. No venue yet, two months out." There's clearly a venue because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is saying in this chat: "November 3rd at—Mikey McCoy, actually—November 3rd at 6:30 p.m., either Auburn—which has 5,000 seats—or the University of Southern Alabama."
