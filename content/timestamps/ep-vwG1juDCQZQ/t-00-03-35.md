## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**

Thank you so much. You are here in my book. Tucker (Tucker Carlson), I don't know. I feel like I should thank you because a lot happened because people thought that we were plotting behind the scenes, and we never were. And thank you, Tucker Carlson, for the weeks that I get off when the media is attacking you instead of me. Now it's kind of together. It's "Tucker Carlson in Kamala zones," but thank you. I want to thank Australia. We see you, Australia. Tony Burke, thank you for banning us from an entire country.
