## Transcript

**Erika Kirk:**
> When we first started dating, I... I asked him. I was like, "Why don't you wear a cross?" He's like, "Why?" "You say you're a Christian, but you don't wear a cross." He's like, "I don't know. I don't really—I'm not a jewelry guy." And I was like, "I understand." So for his first birthday present, I got him this cross. And then throughout time, I would always add different medals to it. And so he always—he loved Saint Michael. And so, yeah, every time he put this on, he just felt like it was his—it was his armor. Are we done here, guys?
