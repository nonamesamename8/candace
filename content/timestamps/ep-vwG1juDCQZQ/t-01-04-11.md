## Transcript

But forming a coalition and helping each other— we already do behind the scenes. I haven't done that with Jimmy Dore, but anything these other people— Ian Carroll: we text regularly. Dave Smith: we text regularly when we're sharing information or asking each other questions or asking for guidance. And I look up to these people for what they're doing.
