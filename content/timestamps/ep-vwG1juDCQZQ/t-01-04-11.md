## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Juan Antonio writes: "Candace, you should team up with Dave Smith, Ian Carroll, and Jimmy Dore. Form a coalition: share editors, push promotion, and spark Occupy Wall Street 2.0 and the Fed. Fulfill Tupac's dream of a new party." I think I'm so traumatized from being at—and like working for—somebody else that I don't know if I could ever work for anybody else. But forming a coalition and helping each other— we already do behind the scenes. I haven't done that with Jimmy Dore, but anything these other people— Ian Carroll: we text regularly. Dave Smith: we text regularly when we're sharing information or asking each other questions or asking for guidance. And I look up to these people for what they're doing.
