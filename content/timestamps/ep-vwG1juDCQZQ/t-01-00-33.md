## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Might have been for the embassy opening. I'm not positive. Yes: regarding that heart still beating if he instantly went to heaven. Didn't Andrew offer up an explanation? This was kind of one of the things that people were asking: how did he go into surgery? Because they explained that he had died instantly. It wasn't just Erika, by the way: Frank Turek said it on stage—that he knew in the car that he was gone. But maybe he still had a pulse. Again: this would be a great thing—since they mentioned it—for Andrew or Frank Turek to respond to. It's a very easy thing for them to respond to to clear up some confusion. Jesse Webb writes: "The amazing, heroic, outstanding, fearless, talented, intelligent, and beautiful Queen Candace of podcasts: take a bow. Nothing can stop you.
