## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So when I saw this moment, I was just thinking about myself and a lot of emotions and grieving that I have experienced, and all the emotions that I've shared with you guys and the anger that I have felt. And I wanna be very clear that I am not that example that she is giving. I could have never—and I know that so many people agree with this—I could have never forgiven Tyler Robinson for whatever part he played in this. And obviously I'm saying whatever part he played in this because I don't believe that he was the lone person involved. I don't even think it's a person that killed Charlie Kirk. But even if you believe all those things, I never could have turned around and forgiven him that quickly, right? And I have not even processed. I definitely, when I prayed about this, asked a ton of questions to God.
