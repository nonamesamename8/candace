## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I look—not even up to these people—I look beside, and I see these people. And I know that we are like in a line united, and there is like an army that's rising—and it feels to me like it is the army of God. I'd love to do work with Jimmy Dore. I have loved his videos, and he has made me laugh in his coverage of the absurd things that we are being told about the Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) assassination. Mina Barbie writes: "Hi Candace: my name is Mina. You have made such a positive impact on my life. Today is my birthday, and it would mean so much if you said happy birthday. Love you. God bless." Happy birthday, Mina. I hope you have a fantastic day. Your birthday already has great vibes because we are number one podcast in the world. So we will not forget your birthday. We will not forget November 6th. We will not forget it. It's a major win. We should be happy.
