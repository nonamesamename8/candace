## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That's N-E-E-M-E skincare.com? Wait: N-I-M-I skincare.com. By the way, I do want to say this: whenever they send all the dogs out about something very relatively minor—like me saying that this event came together too quickly— there's something there. Like: we now need to figure out exactly who put this event together because I just feel like money is being spent for everyone to freak out about something so minor. That just tends to be the pattern. Like I was saying about the Egyptian plagues: when they overreact, it's because we hit a nerve. And so we should focus our attention on how that event came together. If you work for the UVU Turning Point USA chapter and you would like to come forward, please email us at moretips@candaceowens.com and let us know how that event came together—who requested it specifically.
