Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would headline one; I would headline the other. I will guarantee you—and I checked—they did both of these this semester because that's how it works, okay? He's asking you which one you wanna join. They might both be holding the auditoriums that they need to. But this was not being planned when they messaged you. They didn't receive the request the day that they messaged you and say, "Hey, do you want to make this happen?" I don't know what we're doing here. I don't know what the nature of this is. Then you get Lila Rose, who jumps in for no reason at all other than the fact that she's a committed Christian Zionist.
