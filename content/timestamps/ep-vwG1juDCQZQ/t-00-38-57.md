## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So it has existed since 1934. It runs like a well-oiled machine. I've spoken at the Oxford Union. They speak in the same place at the same time. They change the people that are speaking. You sit down with them; you have a dinner. This is Oxford again, not Yale. I've not spoken at Yale. You have a dinner, and you debate somebody, okay? It's a debate union. It's what they do, and what they've been doing since 1934. Lila had—and here's a picture of it—she's comparing this—70 people that attended this debate—to Turning Point USA hosting a debate with thousands of people, sometimes a vice president, sometimes a president. Like, you just—what are you debating? What are you actually—like, when you pause and you think through—what are you debating me on?
