## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Like, when you jump into this, what is motivating your disagreement would be my question. I will read her tweets, and then I will respond to them. So she does a total false debunking by sharing a private message exchange between her and Charlie (Charlie Kirk). This is what she tweeted. She said: "The latest claim is that TPUSA must have been in on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) murder because the UVU campus stop was approved in July." It was not approved in July; it was requested in July. And that's too short of a timeline for an event in September. That is not true. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) texted me at the end of August for a campus event in early November. That's about two months out. And the reason he didn't specify which campus is because he didn't even know yet.
