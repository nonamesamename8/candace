## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Whatever company needs to hear this today, okay? You are no longer allowed to engage in sheer evil. You are no longer allowed to behave like Satan's children and then make little legal threats, okay? Anything that gets sent to me from a lawyer is now publicized. That's it. Don't care who you are. If you're watching this and you're going, "Should I send it to a lawyer?" You probably should. Anything that you send to me is now public. Satan's time is done. It's done, okay? Shouldn't have shot Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). Just shouldn't have killed Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk). That's what I would say. Anyways, top comment from yesterday was: "Somewhere Brigitte Macron is breathing a sigh of relief." I don't know, man. Now that the podcast has gone number one, people are gonna go back and watch the Brigitte Macron series—and once you watch it, you just know.
