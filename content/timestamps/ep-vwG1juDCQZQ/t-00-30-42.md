## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It is the killing of Charlie Kirk, and nothing else for me. And in the aftermath of his assassination, people were downright nasty to me. You saw that. It was definitively not organic. It was this weird need to assert his legacy as a Christian Zionist. By the way, I'm not including Allie in the downright nasty category whatsoever, but she was one of the voices who cast unnecessary shade, I would say, on my account of him becoming Catholic-curious. And it was unnecessary, I would say, only because she could have texted me. She has my number. This is one of the things that Matt Walsh recently said: that he views it as such a form of disloyalty when you have access to an individual, but you will instead go onto your platform to say something about that individual when you could ask for clarity, right?
