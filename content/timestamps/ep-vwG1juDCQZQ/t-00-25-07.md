And nobody is talking about the green hoodie. Here is Colby Sessions. "Hey guys, this is me. My teammate and I were just on campus to get food and stopped by the event. We always wear silly stuff like that. Sorry, guys." That's it. How easy, right? How easy? He's not like, "I'm a victim—call a lawyer. I can't believe somebody asked a question." "I can't believe there's interest in this event where an assassination took place." No: people are asking because they're well-meaning, and he just comes right back and answers it, and it's over. That's how easy, that's how quick, that's how painless it is when you simply tell the truth.
