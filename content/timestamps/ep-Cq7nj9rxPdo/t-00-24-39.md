## Transcript

**George Webb:**
> "McCoy does have this strange military background. He does have this strange—seemingly putting his son in there and guiding the hand for this new apostolic revival that he is a NAR person. He is kind of the NAR push. For Charlie—Charlie was meeting with NAR, and NAR were the $25 million and above donors in—from the Christian right. The Ziklag was the name of the organization." So all that's correct.
