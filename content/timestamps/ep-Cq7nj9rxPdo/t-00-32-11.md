## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We don't know it, but I kind of know. Lastly, there's something interesting that I was kind of hesitant to speak about, but I'm going to. I was hesitant to speak about it because I didn't want it to lead to a thousand conspiracy theories that are just wrong. But I'm interested, and I—again—want to caution you. Don't spin out of control. I actually want some information because there could be something that I'm missing. I am not from the medical field, okay? But on September 10th thereafter—as you've been doing these episodes—we had received a flurry of tips from people telling us that Charlie was not at Timpanogos Hospital but was at UVU Hospital. And I was like—remember there was this whole thing like, "Why did they go to Timpanogos?"
