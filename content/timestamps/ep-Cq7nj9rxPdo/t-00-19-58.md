## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Simon Wiesenthal Center—we're like the official Holocaust people—and "this girl is obviously supporting Hitler." It was heavy. It was so heavy. And I laugh in retrospect because I thought it was all real. I didn't realize this was a matrix of people who wanted to pull me and Charlie apart. That's what they wanted to do. They wanted to put pressure on him. So donors would pressure him and be like, "Hey, she's supporting Hitler. It's such a bad look."
