## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, elsewhere they say that—so basically he wasn't on the phone; he was holding his ears, okay? And then once he got out into the distance—beyond Charlie, beyond the car that Charlie would be carried into—is when he called Erika first and then his father. That's what they tell us. Now, in regards to him saying that Mikey was taking social videos, I can tell you it tracks that Mikey would be taking videos behind—like we know when Charlie first comes out of the event, he's throwing hats. That tracks. That definitely is a thing at Turning Point USA.
