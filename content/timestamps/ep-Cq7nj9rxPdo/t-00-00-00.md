## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys, so here's what's going on today. Turning Point USA has issued a statement, a couple of statements actually. For one, they say the reason that Mikey McCoy walked away so swiftly after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got shot is because Charlie himself told Mikey to do that. Charlie somehow drilled into Mikey McCoy's mind exactly what he should do in that circumstance. Are you buying that? Any buyers of that? I'd like to know because if there are, I'd like to inform you. I didn't want to say it this way, but I am in fact a Nigerian princess. I am stranded currently on an island. I'm gonna need you to send your credit card details right now so I can return home.
