## Transcript

**Candace Owens (archive):**
> "I agree. I actually don't have any problems at all with the word nationalism. I think that it gets—the definition—gets poisoned by leaders that actually want globalism. Globalism is what I—what I don't want. So when you think about whenever we say nationalism, the first thing people think about—at least in America—is Hitler. He was a national socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, okay, fine. The problem is that he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize. He wanted everybody to be German, everybody to be speaking German, everybody to look a different way. To me, that's not nationalism. So in thinking about how we could go bad down the line, I don't really have an issue with nationalism. I really don't. I think that it's okay. It's important to retain your country's identity and to make sure that what's happening here—which I think is incredibly worrisome in terms of just the decrease in the birth rate that we're seeing in the UK—is what you kind of want to avoid.
