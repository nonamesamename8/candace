## Transcript

> Mr. Beast—they're all attached to Raytheon in one way or the other. And I find that to be interesting. And there's more, by the way. I'm in the early days of research here, and there's a lot more I'm gonna present to you guys. But I think we can all acknowledge that we were lied to about the 30-odd-6, right? I know for a fact Charlie's neck was not destroyed. Certainly was not destroyed. And if I'm lying, sue me for defamation, and you'll learn exactly how I know that. This is what makes Andrew Colvett's tweet explaining the conversation with the surgeon especially interesting.
