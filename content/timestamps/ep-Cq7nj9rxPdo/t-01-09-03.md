## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And that is all that we had today. You guys—you'd like to support us? Please go to MakeHimASandwich.com, read this book. You are gonna love it. It's a great gift to give to anybody.

Buy yourself a Candace cup. Other than that, you guys, I am just so grateful to you. Every single day, you are all in my prayers because I know that I am getting the strength from you. Charlie loved the crowd because of the energy. We talked about energy all the time—people that had good energy, bad energy. It is because of you guys fighting for me.
