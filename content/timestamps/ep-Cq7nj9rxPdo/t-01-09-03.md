## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And that is all that we had today. You guys—you'd like to support us? Please go to MakeHimASandwich.com, read this book. You are gonna love it. It's a great gift to give to anybody.

And women—I definitely think it is on us to learn the origins of the feminist movement because it's quite sinister. Everything doesn't look sinister, but of course it is sinister. And it's probably a part of the military-industrial complex. By the way—like I said—we restocked those cups. We don't know now, but CandaceOwens.com. It's another way you can support the show. Buy yourself a Candace cup. Other than that, you guys, I am just so grateful to you. Every single day, you are all in my prayers because I know that I am getting the strength from you. Charlie loved the crowd because of the energy. We talked about energy all the time—people that had good energy, bad energy. It is because of you guys fighting for me.
