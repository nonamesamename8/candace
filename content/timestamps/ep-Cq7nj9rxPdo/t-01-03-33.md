## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Thank you for helping me navigate being a stay-at-home mom. Thank you for helping me find faith again, and thank you for fighting for Charlie." Love that comment so much. Also, yes—Making a Sandwich. I'm so proud of this book. Please tag me when you get it. I get really happy when you guys tag me in the book because it really was a labor of love. Like I said, I wrote every word of this, and I did it outside of the matrix. So there is no book publisher that is involved and no mainstream Simon & Schuster person. We decided to self-publish, and we used actually an amazing Catholic book printer to do this. So I'm proud of that. Groovin with Christ writes, "I love that you are wearing the Miraculous Medal. Living in God's truth is like serenity on steroids. God bless." I should have mentioned—by the way—that you can buy this at MakeHimASandwich.com.
