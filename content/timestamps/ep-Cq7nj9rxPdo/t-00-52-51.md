## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It starts with Sigmund Freud. It ends with Operation Mockingbird—or that's where we are at right now. And I have so much fun. And what happened was Zionists actually infiltrated the book club, passed the book club, and they then started sharing clips and watermarked it as if it was their own content to make money off of. This guy, MilkBarTV—I was like, "You're getting hit with a copyright strike, my friend," okay? Proud of myself. Hit him with a copyright strike 'cause he literally put "Milk Bar TV" content on the corner. He watermarked my content to then smear me, right?
