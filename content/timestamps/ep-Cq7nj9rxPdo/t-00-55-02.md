## Transcript

> Just kidding. I won't be. I will be just as ratchet as I always am in the book club. Lastly, we gotta get to Brigitte Macron because I think everybody now is really tired of her lying about having been born with a penis. Not my fault, okay? If you have not—by the way—watched the "Becoming Brigitte" series and you are appreciating what I'm doing with the Charlie Kirk series, go back and watch it. Same thing. All I did was tell the truth, and people were upset. And then the series went viral. I mean, by "people," I mean the media was upset. The series went viral. There's no way you can watch the series and come out of it thinking that Brigitte was born a female. You can't just disappear 30 years of your life. You can't just say, "I didn't take a picture for 30 years." It doesn't work like that. Okay. Such an easy low bar ever to set to dispel the rumors. "Hey, can we get some pictures from your wedding day? Like, you know, you with your family—and not just pictures that have been given to us from a woman who quite literally is facing charges for falsifying pictures? Like we've got like four photos of the whole life."
