> And it's like all you have to do is disavow this or disavow that, and everything will go back to normal. So yeah, Kanye, I totally understand it. It makes perfect sense to me why you had to say that. Anyways, I think I was saved. I look back, and I think I was saved by this weird pull that I had to go to the UK. It was—now I realize—an unexpected anomaly. My husband—how I met him—this unplanned trip on nobody's calendar; nobody was setting it up. I just like, "Charlie, get a meeting with whoever—make anything happen. I need to be in the UK. I just think that like something good will happen if we go to the UK." And it's kind of beautiful that the person that Charlie reached out to and said, "Can you put together just any place for Candace and I to speak at?" was John and Marina Mappin, the lone donors who wrote that beautiful letter that has impacted the world—like true friends of Charlie who stood up and said that what Turning Point USA is doing is wrong.
