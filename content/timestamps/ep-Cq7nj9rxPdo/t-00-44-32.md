## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Something happens to George, call Candace. That is almost in the sphere of common sense. So I believe that. I don't believe that Charlie said, "If I get shot, don't help me. Calmly walk away and call Erika first." Like, I think—yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Like I said, we have nothing to go off of. I think it's curious that we're hearing this from Andrew, and we're not hearing it from Mikey McCoy. It's very easy to dispel any internet innuendo. You don't actually have to jump into ad hominem attacks. The first thing I would have done—just like I did when I was being accused of colluding on the Blake Lively story, when I got drafted into that lawsuit and they thought that I was working with Blake Lively's—sorry—working with Justin Baldoni's team—is I quite literally live-subpoenaed myself. Held to my phone. I typed in "Blake Lively," and I showed you the only two times that I had ever texted about her in my phone at all
