## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Over the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to genetically select superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones or antibiotics. And every fall, the calves containing these elite genetics return to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in the lush mountain pastures. When you purchase Riverbend Ranch, you are not only supporting the 64 cowboys and their families who work on the ranch, but you are also supporting over 260 other U.S. ranches and the hundreds of American families who work on those ranches. Born in the U.S.A., it's raised in the U.S.A., it's processed right here in the U.S.A.
