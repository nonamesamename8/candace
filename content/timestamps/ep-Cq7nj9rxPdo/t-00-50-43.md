## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> A couple of psychological manipulations happening there. First is like the academic one, where he's trying to present himself as an authority on the topic and saying to you like, "There is no—you know—everybody can do anything when shots are fired. We don't know when you're shocked by shots being fired. Some people just—you know—start doing the hokey pokey." I mean, look—some people literally—they hear shots fired; they get on a table, and they start dancing and singing and saying, "Shoot me, shoot me." Like George Zimmerman—that's—"No, hey, we don't know. He was in shock." George Zimmerman—"I did it, I did it." That's a normal—"Hey, we don't know," right? Like, we do actually know that we all have a baseline response to danger. You run towards it because you want to rescue people.
