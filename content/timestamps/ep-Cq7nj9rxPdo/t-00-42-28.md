## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You follow the person to get behind the scenes. I would have Savannah do this before Mikey McCoy did this. It was Sarah Schmackenberger. And they do that. They like the behind-the-scenes reactions. But in this particular video, he's not standing where you can get a view of Charlie asking a question. So this part is not tracking. Okay, Mikey is not standing to the side of Charlie; he is behind. And so if you're saying what earlier—we're supposed to see him—the best place to stand if you're gonna get a video of Charlie asking a question is going to be in a place where you can see both Charlie and the person asking the question. And that's just not where he's standing.
