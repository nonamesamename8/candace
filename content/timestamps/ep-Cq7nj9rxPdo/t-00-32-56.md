## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Timpanogos was like a level three trauma center when the closer one was UVU. We never really understood why the ambulance wasn't there when it was required by law. He goes into this car. We don't really know. When I say we don't know, I mean we have no footage or any indication of the drive or the arrival at Timpanogos. And I thought it was weird that we had people that were saying, "I was downstairs at UVU, and Charlie was brought in. And I am telling you, he was definitely at this hospital." Somebody else said to me, "I was receiving treatment. I don't know if it was cancer treatment downstairs or upstairs. And we knew he was at this hospital."
