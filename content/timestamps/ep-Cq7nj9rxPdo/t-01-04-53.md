## Transcript

Would you mind sharing your homeschooling plan sometime? My wife and I tried twice—traditional and unschooling—but it did not succeed. I'd love to know what's working for you. Thanks, and keep up the great work." First thing I want to say: it has been an absolute gift to have my kids at home. I can't explain to you—I am a happier person because of it. I can't believe we just send off the joy and go to work. Everything they say—it's so cute to watch the way their brains are forming and to realize that it's really hard to explain concepts when they take everything so literally.
