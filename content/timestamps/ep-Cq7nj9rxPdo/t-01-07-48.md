## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Beck Build writes, "Great work, Candace. Praying for your safety and that Charlie's prophecy that you will lead this movement to victory will empower you even more." Thank you for that. Pixie Chickie writes, "Candace, you are a class act. You are fighting for Charlie just like he asked you." Quoting Maya Angelou: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time." "You have done that and more to bring truth to light. Charlie would be so proud." I know he's proud. I absolutely know that Charlie is proud, and that everything that we discussed—I hate that he was right about his life—but I also know that I'm the right person to do this because I came through that matrix, and I know what's up and what's down. Like, they just can't fool me with this stuff. You've done it to me so many times, and I survived it, and you can't do the thing that you always do, which is try to convince the world the person is crazy—because I'm not giving them that.
