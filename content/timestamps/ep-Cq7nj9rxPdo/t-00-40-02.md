## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> But I would like to get to the bottom of that. Okay, let's jump in here to TPUSA's response to the Mikey McCoy. Actually, it wasn't really a response because, to be fair, they did their episode before my episode went out. Charlie Kirk's show is before my show is. But it was their response to the Mikey McCoy video going viral. So not a response to me, but rather a response to the people who had pulled this out—who had discovered this over the weekend. So like James Lee, Ian Carroll, Sam Parker. And here is what Andrew Kolvet had to say. (Andrew Kolvet speaking) He's going to tell us that Mikey was told to do this in the event of this type of an emergency by—you guessed it—Charlie Kirk. Take a listen.
