## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The first people to get booked. It was hard to find a student that spoke to a mainstream media news organization on that day. Something's not right. There are too many military players that were surrounding Charlie, and they weren't there before 2018. They weren't there until forces were trying to pull me and Charlie apart. I had it on my heart to share this with you because I think it will help you when you start to look at things and assess people, and they tell you, "He's a genius." Then you learn that they have—I don't know—a contract with the Department of Defense. He might just be a military-grade actor meant to lead a company, because if we all looked up and realized the military owns everything—and maybe has owned everything and controlled everything since they shot JFK—well, that wouldn't be a good thing for us to know, right? And we don't know it.
