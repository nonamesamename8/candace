## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This is early 2019. And it was like, "Hey, we know that you don't believe these things." And at the time, I thought they were just being friends. I don't know what to think anymore. Marissa Streit (Marissa Streit), the CEO, has never shied from telling people that she is... you know, in the IDF. She works—she worked intelligence in the IDF, right, in Israel. And I was—I took the job with them, and Charlie and I still climbed together, but we were also working apart at the same time. We kept doing the campuses and the campus tours, but I was officially working for PragerU. And one of the first things that happened— almost the way it feels to me was like, "We can save you, but here's what you have to do"—was Marissa took me to the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
