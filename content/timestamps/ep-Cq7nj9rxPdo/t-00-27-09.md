## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> What are you doing?" I asked her, and she's like, "Well—and that woman that attacked me and took her cross." And I said, "That's weird. Like, that's kind of random. You're supposed to be the pro-life person, and you're talking about—you're talking to Andrew Kolvet's party to that lawsuit. You're talking to her lawyer. Why on your show? Why are you the first show she would pick? Why doesn't she go on like CNN or Fox News?" And I looked, and of course, yeah, you got military—military all over that background. And I'm going, "Is anything not military?" I'm looking at Bari Weiss, and I'm looking into her grandfather, and there's a story that's just incredible. A bomb thrown at his house—and I think it's in Philly or somewhere, and maybe it's Pittsburgh—and that's related to the casinos. I mean, the whole thing starts getting really crazy when you realize everyone's somehow attached to Raytheon, right?
