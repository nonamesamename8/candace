> But I just knew that Kanye West was not a part of the simulation, so to speak, and that the song "Power," as Kanye said, is a battle cry to be yourself because of the lyrics. And I have this old text that I'm going to show you from Charlie. This is April 13th, 2018. This is what I said to him just so you can kind of get the vibe of what was going on. I said, "Yo, Kanye West writing a philosophy book called 'Break the Simulation.' We need him, Charlie. He is Blexit AF." And Charlie wrote back, "I love Kanye. He's my soul brother. I will find a way to him. I promise we have to." It's crazy to look at that and realize that he's about to tweet us—about to tweet me.
