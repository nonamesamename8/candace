## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Back when I did my initial tribute video to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), some people took issue theologically when I said that the day that Kanye West tweeted, "I love the way Candace Owens thinks," Charlie and I freaked out because we were convinced that we had somehow manifested that. I'm aware. I received tons of emails. "This goes against Christian doctrine." This was 2018. I was not a Catholic. And I think it's important to discuss that and why we thought we manifested that, because it is extremely relevant to what took place thereafter. I have to explain that moment to you.
