## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I don't think Charlie knew—definitely not when Tyler brought him or when he got hired. His brother, Captain Kurt Kolvet, is in the military. His cousin, Captain Robert Kolvet, is high up in the military. So that's interesting. Very interesting to me, at least, because I just am like, "Oh, that's kind of something I was not aware of." I thought he was just a PR guy. Some of that was working PR and was found, and things, you know, went forward. Obviously, Rob McCoy, another pastor— but a pastor with a very strong military background. Pastor Rob McCoy—his father was the naval captain, was a naval captain, Roy Edgar McCoy. But also—and this is kind of shocking—his father was also the assistant chief of staff for psychological warfare in the Navy.
