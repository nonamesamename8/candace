## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Let's just—you know—take a look at the chart that we have put together. And this is in an early phase, but it's interesting at the very least, okay? We've got Frank Turek, and Frank Turek—if we want to go through this—we've got Andrew Kolvet, Rob McCoy, Mikey McCoy, Tyler Bowyer. Let's go through. Let's start with Frank Turek if we have that card. And Frank Turek—again, has been honest—former officer in the U.S. Navy, and then he turned to Christian apologetics. He has two sons that are in the military—fly planes—as well as one of his son's spouses that's in the military. Again, he's never lied about this. Andrew Kolvet—by the way, if you don't know, I didn't know.
