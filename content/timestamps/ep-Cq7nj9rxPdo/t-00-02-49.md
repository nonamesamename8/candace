## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> As I showed you yesterday, Charlie was having a lot of vivid dreams—dreams that he said he had throughout his entire life—that he was going to die in a really tragic, quick way. But especially in April, he was having vivid dreams that something big was about to happen. This is in the weeks leading up to the tweet, okay? Full stop. Charlie knew, and I felt, that we were on the brink of something big. Okay, you have to remember, we were young. I'm a lot older than Charlie. I was like 24 at the time, maybe even 23 years old at the time. And we were doing the Fox News gambit—every show on Fox News—but I was really just focused on BLM, Black Lives Matter. I felt they were lying to Black Americans, and it was going to harm us.
