## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He introduced him to every person that Charlie knows. He starts hiring a bunch of people, telling Charlie that we need to hire bigger and more professional money raisers, PR people like Andrew Kolvet—you name it. And it feels like at every moment there were forces that were trying to tell us this is not allowed to happen.

This is in the time of Kim Kardashian and Kanye. She wanted nothing to do with it, okay? And I've been to their house, and political friends are telling Charlie and I, "Don't get involved with Kanye because he's crazy.
