## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You got away with offending Emmanuel when he was 14 years old—sexual offense. And you went after—I mean, he was a child in my view, in everyone's view—a 14-year-old kid. You got a 40-year-old adult that goes after him, and now you're pretending you're the victim, okay? A little bit crazy. We're getting tired of it. You can't just keep pretending everything is just happening to you. Just present some pictures. Stop pretending that you're offering genetic evidence in the court hearing against me. You're not even suing me for the claim that I said you were born a male. You're suing me for the claim that I said you stole your sister's identity to transition. That's what you're suing me over—amongst very many other things that are ridiculous.
