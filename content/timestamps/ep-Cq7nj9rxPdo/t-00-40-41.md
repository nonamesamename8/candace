## Transcript

**Andrew Kolvet:**
> "Here's the last thing I want to make a point of— because Charlie had given me similar instructions along the years. He said, 'If anything ever happens to me, you call Erika.' And he drilled that into Mikey's brain so that when this moment of trauma happened, that he turned around, and he knew he had to do it. And by the way, the last thing—because this is part of the video allegations here—is that they're alleging that he was on the phone immediately. He was not. He was taking social videos, which he would send to our group chat, which we would then put on Charlie's social—why the event was happening—so you could see the crowd come in or his interactions. And we were only two questions into this event.
