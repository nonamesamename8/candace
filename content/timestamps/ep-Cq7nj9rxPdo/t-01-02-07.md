## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Nimi is doing something radical. They've built one of their most popular lines around one of the most nutrient-rich, bioavailable ingredients on earth, which is grass-fed beef tallow. Tallow is a traditional ancestral secret. Its composition is incredibly similar to our own skin's natural oils, which means your skin actually recognizes it. It's not a chemical coating. It's real nourishment. Nimi has two products from their tallow line that you should know about. First, your daily hydration: there's the Sunshine Tallow Cream. This is your go-to moisturizer. It's light; it absorbs quickly, and it doesn't leave you with that greasy feeling on your skin. They've combined that with soothing aloe vera and jojoba oil. It's perfect for your face and body to create a strong, resilient skin barrier against the daily grind.
