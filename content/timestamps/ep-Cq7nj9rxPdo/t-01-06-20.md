## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> There is Ivanka. Trump wouldn't and couldn't do anything without getting his daughter back." No, I don't hold out any hope at all, actually. And the fact that Trump even invited Kash Patel to that Charlie holiday thing—which I'll get into tomorrow—or establishing a holiday, I think is proof to me that he wants this buried. I think actually Don Jr. may have even said that. He accepts the narrative. I'll have to dig up that clip for you guys tomorrow. I have no hope whatsoever.
