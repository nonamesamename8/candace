## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

They pulled the clip, and then a bunch of people were—articles saying that I supported Adolf Hitler and that I said, "If Hitler had just wanted to make Germany great again, then okay, fine." That's fine. No context again. And it was like a severe cancel culture attack saying that I supported Jews being killed in the Holocaust. It was insane. Again, Charlie and I were very new, and this was very scary. We were kind of coming upon a high point and going, "Why do people want to destroy us? We don't know what this is."
