## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now I know that these online campaigns are inorganic, and that what actually happened was this was a hit. This was a hit. They pulled the clip, and then a bunch of people were—articles saying that I supported Adolf Hitler and that I said, "If Hitler had just wanted to make Germany great again, then okay, fine." That's fine. No context again. And it was like a severe cancel culture attack saying that I supported Jews being killed in the Holocaust. It was insane. Again, Charlie and I were very new, and this was very scary. We were kind of coming upon a high point and going, "Why do people want to destroy us? We don't know what this is." And at the same time, the Simon Wiesenthal Center—and this is again another interesting piece of this—put me—like, issued a statement against my comments.
