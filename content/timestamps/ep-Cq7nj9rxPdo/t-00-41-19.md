## Transcript

**Andrew Kolvet:**
> So he was still getting it out to all the chats he needed to do, which he did at every event. He turns around, and it was so blaringly loud, I'm told. You would know this better than I do, but this is what I'm told. It was so blaringly loud, and he was so shell-shocked. He put his fingers in his ear, but his phone was still in his hand. He walks away—and he's... Not even walk. I want to... Because people are talking about that. The way it was is we had a cordoned-off area with rates, so you had controlled access. All the people—when this happens—they all get the idea we should leave before we are shot. And so there's a little narrow gap that I think people—it's not really walking. It's that everyone has to slow up to get through this little narrow choke point to get out of the area."
