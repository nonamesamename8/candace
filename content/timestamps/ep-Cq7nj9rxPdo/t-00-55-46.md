## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And yeah, I'm being sued because that's the next logical step. You sue people for telling the truth to scare them. And it's all related, by the way. We're talking about who Brigitte actually is, the families that Brigitte is related to, the fact that Emmanuel Macron is in fact—just like the state of Israel—a Rothschild creation; talking about the military industrial complex and talking about the Kabbalah. Kabbalah very much is the reason for this push in culture for transgenderism. We'll get more into that in the book club, which gets a bit more theological.
