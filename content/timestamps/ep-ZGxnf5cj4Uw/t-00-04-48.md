## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Interesting. There's more, of course. Of most interest to me, what I've learned is that his father does not believe—his parents don't believe—that their son committed this crime. I was like, huh? Excuse me? That's a far cry from what the media has been telling us. Remember, the media presented this amazing story. The father realized his son was guilty, so it goes, right? And then he phoned over a friend to help him convince his son to turn himself in because this guy, you know, this mysterious guy was a friend and just had a connection with Tyler. And eventually they said, you've got to do the right thing here. We know this is you.
