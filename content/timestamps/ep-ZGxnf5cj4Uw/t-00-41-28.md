## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then he mentioned Governor Cox, and he mentions Tyler Bowyer of Turning Point USA and says that—again, this is according to Nick—that Tyler Bowyer and the Lyman have been speaking, and that they're—you know—really going to make Governor Cox—and I'm paraphrasing here—but apparently there's another Utah event—USU event—coming up, and Governor Cox is supposed to speak, and Phil Lyman intimates that like—you know—at this TPUSA event, Governor Cox isn't going to look great. I'm like, what? He then tells him, “I'm gonna go—if you don't mind—I'm gonna take a phone call in my car.”
