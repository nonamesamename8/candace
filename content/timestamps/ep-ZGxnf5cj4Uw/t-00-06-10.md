## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then I'm told—and I believe this—that the way in which he got arrested, or rather turned himself in, was because that family friend slash neighbor slash former detective told him, “Hey, it's best for you to turn yourself in because there's only one of two options here.” Either you turn yourself in and everything is peaceable, or the SWAT team could come in here and arrest you and things would get crazy. So that's what happened. He went over to their house. Tyler was called over. Tyler was bewildered. He disputed the idea that he had murdered Charlie (Charlie Kirk). In fact, according to my source, Tyler has never even stepped foot on UVU campus.
