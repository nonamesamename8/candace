## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Tyler Robinson also appears to have full lips—even though this image is blurry. We're not looking for someone that's got fuller lips. And Tyler Robinson looks broader than that individual walking, right? So I'm on board with that person walking up the stairs. It's not Tyler Robinson because I feel like it was intentionally blurred. They also never gave us the footage at all because in order to blur it, they probably needed a static image. Also, the family believes that—and this is really interesting—Tyler Robinson's apartment was staged after his arrest. Now, you will recall that I spoke to Lance's family. And one of the things that Lance's family said was, “It was—hey, we own that apartment. They pay rent to us. We've never met Tyler Robinson.”
