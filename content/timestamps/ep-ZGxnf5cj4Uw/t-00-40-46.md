## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I said, “What specifically did he say to you?” Well, he tells me that Phil has also set up a time to meet with Ian Carroll. Okay. So Ian Carroll is conducting his own separate investigation. We are not collaborating at all, but Ian Carroll publicized that he was going up to Utah because he wanted to be on the ground physically by himself. And he was reaching out to people who had been speaking about having been there, and Phil Lyman is so gracious that he offers to give him a tour. And Nick tells me: he's like, “That's really weird now because we're like two weeks on from the shooting, and Phil Lyman lives four hours away.” So that's very, very gracious of him to do, but his energy isn't good.
