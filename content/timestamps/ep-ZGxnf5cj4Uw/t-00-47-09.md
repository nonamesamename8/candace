## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So my uncle was with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). This is the video that they posted. Everything was done publicly. And now I'm like, okay— maybe you have something that's helpful. I wanna ask you about: could you send me that photo? Could you send me that video? Could you send me all of this stuff? And now I'm getting radio silence. So unfortunately, because I need to figure out what happened on that day, I'm turning to the public to try to identify those people and anything else that you may know that may help put things together for us. Again, please reserve the tips at CandaceOwens.com for actual tips related to the questions that we are asking—not for just comments; those sorts of things; videos that you'd like me to watch or things that you'd like to do to point me into a different direction.
