## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They're just like, “Obviously this is wrong, and this is weird, and I'm on the left maybe.” Max Blumenthal dropped a bunch of articles last week, and I think he's got more coming out. Why is Max Blumenthal—who wasn't a friend of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—more interested in what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) than the people closest to him? That strikes me as very odd. Just odd. I mean, no element. They could at the very least name the donors—get a little bit of revenge; name the donors who were pressuring him; tell the truth about what was happening there. They won't do any. They're just like, “Oh, it's all good.” It's all good. No, it's not all good, actually. Not all good at all. Bitsy writes: the whole world is a stage used to hurdle the cattle in the direction that they want to take us.
