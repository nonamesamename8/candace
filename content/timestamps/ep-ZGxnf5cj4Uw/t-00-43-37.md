## Transcript

> Said, “I took my friends to my grandma's house tonight, and we retraced his steps, and we took pictures in the exact place that the security cameras caught him. I've been through this new experience for the last few days. I'm still very glad to have attended and to support Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and to see him.” The last pic shows Converse-brand footprints. And then he does hashtags, and here are him and the three friends. And by the way, I'm looking at the front on the right, and I'm like: I don't know. I'd like to know who that is, at the very least. And I'd like to know who everybody in this photo is. This is just interesting. Like, you guys are in the staircase and posting side-by-sides. Like they put the side-by-side photos of them in the staircase. And I just was like, I need to just know more about you.
