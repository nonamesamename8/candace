## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They thought that Lance was just his roommate, and they were especially shocked because apparently Tyler kept mentioning to them that he wanted them to meet some girl that he was seeing. Now, I would like to interject my own voice here and say that I think this girl was likely Lance, and Tyler was working up the courage to tell his family that he was gay. That is what is most likely, in my opinion, because we know for a fact that Tyler was in fact in a relationship with Lance—because we have exclusive photos, by the way; they're about to show you—that the two of them posted to their Instagrams. This is Lance posting Halloween-era photos: “I forgot to post. My boyfriend is the best. Love you.”
