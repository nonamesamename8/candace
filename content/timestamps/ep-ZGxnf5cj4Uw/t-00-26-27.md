## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Fast forward to me looking into the witness list, and obviously we spoke about this—Tiffany Peterson Barker—that very weird clip of her with her nieces at like 4 a.m. in the morning just speaking on Good Morning America, and her energy was just weird to me. I thought her being there was weird. Obviously this is my podcast; I can say whatever I want. We reached out to her, and then she gave us a ton of information and but never actually presented to us— She never sent me directly any footage that could verify that she was there when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got shot, okay? And she was a bit upset that I didn't clarify that. I thought it was weird that she wouldn't just text me the footage
