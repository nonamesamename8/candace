## Transcript

**Phil Lyman:**
> They thought they had the shooter. So I took a friend of mine. We went back to my aunt's house and said, “Well, we'll just hang out here for a while.” And before long, the people were combing the backyard—as you saw. She had the footage of that. And pretty soon, helicopters are overhead. So this is very, very local to me. Not only is it Utah, but it's my neighborhood where I spent so much of my childhood and all of my relatives. This is really astonishing. I got up yesterday morning at six o'clock to drive up and meet Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I haven't been to bed since then because it's just one thing after another after another. So astonishing that this could happen in Utah.
