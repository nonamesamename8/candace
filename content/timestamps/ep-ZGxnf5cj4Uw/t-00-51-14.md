## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I just found it—like most of you did—to be odd, given the fact that the hitman was still on the run, that you would bring your nieces there. And she gave her explanation, and—like I said—you can go to her Instagram. She has asked us repeatedly to send you guys to her Instagram where she explains why they decided to go back that early in the morning. And like I said, Phil Lyman was the one who got her the hit—or Phil Lyman's office; her sister got her the hit—on Good Morning America. Kristen Theorette writes: “Candace (Candace Owens), I am so sorry for the loss of your dear friend. I agree that it's weird that the people closest to him are just moving on. I feel this whole story is very twisted, and you are the only one who is capable of unraveling the truth.” Yeah, and sadly, the people that I am in partnership with on demanding more answers are not even people who were friends with Charlie (Charlie Kirk).
