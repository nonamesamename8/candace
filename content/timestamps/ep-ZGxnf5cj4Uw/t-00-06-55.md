## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Tyler, it turns out—which has already been revealed—was accepted into Utah State University, not Utah Valley. And that's actually interesting if you pause and reflect on that, because we didn't really consider how on earth Tyler became not just familiar with the layout of the campus, but familiar with the rooftop layout of UVU campus— so familiar that he knew exactly how to scale across the rooftops to duck down in order to take an almost impossible shot at Charlie (Charlie Kirk) who was sitting beneath a tent. How did he know how to do all of that? Had he been there before? That he knew where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was going to be sitting in it, that he would have that shot from on top of the Losey Center? What?
