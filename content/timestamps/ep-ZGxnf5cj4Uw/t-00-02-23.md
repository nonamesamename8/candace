## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> In fact, I was told that he was quote-unquote bewildered by the idea that he carved casings. I should be clear: he does not dispute the fact that it is his gun at all. It is his gun, but Tyler is not exactly a gun enthusiast. He doesn't hunt like his other brothers do. In fact, he's apparently a fisherman. The reason that he has that gun in the first place is because it is in fact a custom-made family heirloom. Tyler is the firstborn son, so he inherited. That's what firstborns do. They get the family heirloom. That is why he has the gun.
