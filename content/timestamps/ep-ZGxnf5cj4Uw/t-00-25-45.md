## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And right away he told me on like day two of the investigation that he worked on Phil Lyman's gubernatorial campaign. Phil Lyman ran against the current Governor Cox, and he lost. And one day—very early on; this must have been like day three—Nick cold calls me, and Phil Lyman's on the phone, okay? Like I said, he ran for governor, and I was prepping for the show, and things were early on, and I was still in a very aggrieved phase, and I didn't really know I was on the phone with this guy—Phil Lyman. And I was like, “Okay, thank you so much. I appreciate that you're offering help.” Nick insisted to me he's a fantastic person. He has tons of resources. He knows the area. If you need any help, he can help you. Okay, great.
