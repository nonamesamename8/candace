## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I would actually—and I don't know—but I would imagine that even actual current UVU students don't know that possibility. Like, they're not even that familiar with how to scale the rooftops and what shots they can take from it. We'll see. Curiously, however, my source says that Tyler Robinson was nearby the campus on that day. I'm wondering if that fact—which I'm trying to learn more information regarding—explains the Dairy Queen photo. Because what was he doing around the campus on that day? Where exactly was he around the campus on that day?
