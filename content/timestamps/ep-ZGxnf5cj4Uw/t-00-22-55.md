## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And right now, the greatest silences are around the lives that are being ended before they even take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, we need to act like it. And that's why I'm asking everyone to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love. For just $28—that is the cost of giving a woman that is in a crisis a free ultrasound. She might be considering abortion, but for just $28, you can help her see the life that's growing inside of her. And you will be able to provide her with truth that I don't think the culture will ever provide her with. So don't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold; be clear; be unapologetically pro-life. Go to preborn.com/Candace right now. You can give $28. You can also give 10 times that amount if you want to or if you can.
