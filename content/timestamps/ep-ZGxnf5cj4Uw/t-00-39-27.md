## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I decide to keep pushing on military leads that I have: people that were on the ground that day who I've confirmed were in the military. Anyways, then something insane happens. Nick calls me, and he's a little bit undone. He tells me that Phil Lyman has just showed up at his house. Now, I want to be very clear. Nick is 20 years old. He's a 20-year-old UVU student and a major super fan of Phil as of 48 hours ago. And he's very uncomfortable. And he tells me that Phil randomly messaged him, saying that he was nearby in town—in town rather—and asked Nick for his address—something that he never had.
