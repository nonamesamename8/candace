## Transcript

**Phil Lyman:**
> Hey, it's September 10th, 2025, and I was just heading back from Salt Lake to Blanding. I'm getting a very late start. It's about 11:30 at night, and I wanted to swing back by UVU campus where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was killed today and see if I could let a few of the police officers know how much I appreciate the work they're doing—see if there's some college students here that I could rub shoulders with—more for my benefit than for theirs. But what I really wanted to share was I was very close this morning where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was at. I met him backstage, and we talked for a moment before he went on stage. And I was backstage as he started speaking and decided to go up top. And I went up to the top and ironically was very close to where the shooter was, apparently.
