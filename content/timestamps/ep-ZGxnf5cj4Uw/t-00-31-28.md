And now I'm not saying that Tyler Robinson wasn't on the roof. I'm not saying he didn't pull a trigger. I know I was in very, very close proximity. So another interesting thing—like I say—I left the front of the stage. I wanted to meet some of my friends and bring them down front. So it was clear at the east end. And I heard this loud boom. I heard this loud bang. And I turned around.
