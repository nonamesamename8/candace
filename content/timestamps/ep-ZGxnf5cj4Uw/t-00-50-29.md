## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> based off everything that I've seen and the lingering questions that I have and some other leads that we are working on. That's how I feel. And even when I was trying to find this Mike Mitchell, I could find the Mitchell family. I don't know if it's his family, but the Mitchell name in that area was coming up for like Air Force. And so I—again—when I get into these places where I can't find any more information, I turn to you guys to help me out. But I find it very strange that you would protect somebody who's been on the force for 24 years. Like, what? You've always been a public figure, essentially. And I think Brooksby has some nervous energy there when he's like, “Oh, he called me. That's just totally usual.” It's not weird. It's like, nobody said it was weird. So why are you answering for something that nobody said? Little things like that. It's the same thing like when I saw Tiffany's interview.
