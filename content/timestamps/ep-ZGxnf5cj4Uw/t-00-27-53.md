## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like, did you share something that would have had them reach out? Well, then I told you: she told us, “Actually, Phil Lyman is the person that put me on Good Morning America. My sister ran with him as lieutenant governor.” And I was like, “Oh, okay.” So Phil Lyman got you that position on Good Morning America. You had essentially a connection there that made that happen. Don't know how I missed this. But then I learned that Phil Lyman himself was very involved in all of the communications that immediately went out about the shooting, and that his car was in the driveway of the now infamous TMZ footage—which showed the shooter walking twice that day by this house.
