> So he's just idling in a 20-year-old's driveway who just happened to work on his campaign, and he's on the phone. And this is why he's calling me panicking. He's like, “I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what's happening. I don't know why he's being so weird. I don't know why he's asking me questions about this investigation.” And I'm like, “Yeah, this is weird. This is very weird.” So then I'm like—I'm honing in here. I'm like, what's going on? I feel like he knows something, at the very least. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how I feel. And I begin actually searching through our tips box for anything related to Phil Lyman. Maybe somebody else noticed something or knew something or he said something. And lo and behold—very early on— someone just messaged us and said, “Hey, like, you should probably ask more questions about Phil Lyman because every time I look into this investigation locally, him and his family members are popping up.”
