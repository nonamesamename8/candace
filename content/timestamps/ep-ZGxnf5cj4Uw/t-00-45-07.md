## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Strangely, Phil kind of freaks out. He doesn't want to share those photos with Nick. And he asks him explicitly, “Whose side are you on?” Whose side are you on? I thought we were all on the same side. We're all trying to catch Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s killer one way or the other. You inserted yourself into this; got on the phone with me. I was not even trying to make any communication with you. I literally am just asking questions. And now all of a sudden it's like, oh, you don't want to answer any questions. You don't want to share anything. And he tells me that yesterday Phil Lyman just calls him, and he shouts at him—“Who the F do you think you are?” kind of a deal—you know what I mean? Like, “Who are you to ask me for anything? I already gave my photos to Tayler Hansen.”
