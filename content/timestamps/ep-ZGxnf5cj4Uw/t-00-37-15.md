## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I actually start noticing as I'm looking into this investigation that everyone who was involved on that day—I mean literally—the person who spots the shooter on the roof: military; the person who says, “Oh, I just happened to be in the right place in the Flag of Halls where I saw him running”: also in the military. And I'm starting to think: is it possible that this is like a military hit? I don't know. I'd like to find out. Next came a tip that you guys saw me receive live on the show. Someone paid—a woman paid—to say, “Candace (Candace Owens), there's more footage of the shooter on that day. And you should know that that shooter was with a woman,” right?
