## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> On November 13, 2022, SUBTT flies from Cairo to Paris to Wichita, Kansas, to Wilmington, Delaware, back to Cairo. That is already a four-legged two-continent hop that ends in Wilmington before going home. Four days later, on November 17th, 2022, it does Egypt to Wilmington, again, departing at 8:54 a.m., and this time it stays in Wilmington until November 20th. And only then returns to Cairo. So that is two Wilmington arrivals in the same week. Nobody burns a government Falcon 7X on two separate Wilmington runs for no reason.
