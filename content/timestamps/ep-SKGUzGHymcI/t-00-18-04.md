## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> "We have an entire generation of law enforcement and the private sector working together, trying to figure out how to help each other and to have each other's backs." Yeah, to have each other's backs. So let's recap these facts. On September 10, an Egyptian government aircraft with a history of flying to France and the United States lands at a small Delaware airport under a French company maintenance pretext that doesn't actually match the hangar timeline, because the French visit predates the French company's deal. Within an hour, federal SUVs move from that airport to 920 North King Street.
