> on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, the plane that had initially carried over the 12 or 14 quote-unquote Egyptians six days earlier—that plane, the yellow plane, departed on the morning at 7:14 a.m. local time from Provo, Utah. And it's headed to Wilmington, Delaware. It arrived in Wilmington, Delaware at 11:51 a.m. Eastern. So that's at around 9:51 a.m. Utah time. Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s gonna get shot at 12:23. This plane has landed into Wilmington at what would be 9:51 a.m., so about two and a half hours before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is shot.
