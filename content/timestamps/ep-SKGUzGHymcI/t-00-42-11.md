## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If you join the corporate, the experts, and try to throw mud at people who are speaking about the obvious lies, eventually, you will get swallowed by them. That's how it goes. You know, you sell your soul to the devil, eventually, you'll get swallowed by it. Now, that's not a way to say that Tim (Tim Pool) sold himself to the devil. He's a bit of a fence-sitter. I like Tim (Tim Pool). He's always been good to me. But when it matters, he will always just take like a little dig. And he kind of did that when I started investigating the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) series. And he kind of said, oh, well, now you're number one podcast and you should be more concerned about Harmony. As I started saying that the donors were squeezing Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Like that's the main thing. This is a part of the story. Like donors were getting very angry with Charlie (Charlie Kirk).
