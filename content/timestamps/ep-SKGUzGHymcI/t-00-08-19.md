## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> "Given that I know most of the locations that these vehicles visit, I am entirely confident in stating" "that the plane and those vehicles are connected to 920 North King Street, which is at a place that is marketed also as one Rodney Square." "Nearly every federal vehicle that visits the airport will pass through King Street at least once because that is where the majority of the vehicles are ultimately stationed." "We do this because it is discreet." "The reason people don't know about this is because assets can be transferred to cars without diplomatic plates."
