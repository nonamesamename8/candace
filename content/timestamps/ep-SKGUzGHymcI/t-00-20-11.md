## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I mean, just look at the choice of St. Louis, Wichita, Omaha, Lincoln, Williston, Minot, and Provo. None of these are standard diplomatic hubs. Most of those don't even have major consulates. And absolutely none of them are known for large-scale Egyptian presence, so that immediately undermines the whole, it's just a maintenance stop excuse. Ask yourself, why else a state aircraft would hopscotch across America to remote cities if its purpose was just servicing at a defunct Wilmington Dassault Center? Wilmington is undeniably a terminal point and the only logical reason points to 920 North King Street. I could go through all of the dates and do this, but you already mapped the flights, so you already understand exactly what I'm saying.
