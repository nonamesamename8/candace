## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Today, if you punch that address into public directories, you will find the DEA, Drug Enforcement Agency, at 920 North King Street, and at the same address, the United States Secret Service, 920 North King Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 19801. Both are live, both are at Suite 404, both also publish phone numbers. In the Secret Service case, the agency's own 2025 field office list still shows Wilmington, Delaware. That means the suites that the Department of Justice owned in the 1990s never actually went away.
