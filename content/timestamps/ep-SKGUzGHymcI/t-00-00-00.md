## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. So we received a couple of weeks ago a very thorough tip regarding Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination and the Egyptian planes. Now, what is even more compelling about this tip is that this individual who works with or for the government sent it before I had figured out that the Egyptian planes were tracking Erika (Erika Kirk) and Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Now, the individual also focused on something that at first seemed to me to be very micro to the situation, and now it seems quite macro. And it's an answer perhaps to the question: What was the Egyptian military plane, which left Provo on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, doing in Delaware?
