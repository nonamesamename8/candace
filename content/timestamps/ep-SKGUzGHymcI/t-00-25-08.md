## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They only use the top one or 2% of the entire Angus population as their breeding stock, producing beef that has much more flavor and tenderness than your average Angus beef. Each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. All of Riverbend Ranch's cattle were born and raised right here in the USA. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. And the beef is processed right at the ranch in their award-winning USDA-inspected processing facility. So you avoid the costly middlemen because the beef is sent directly from Riverbend Ranch to your home. And I love supporting American ranchers, of course. Right now when you order from riverbendranch.com. And if you use promo code Candace, you will get $20 off your first order. That's riverbendranch.com with promo code Candace.
