## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anyways, again, that's all in friendly fire. We will get to a couple more sponsorships before I answer some of your questions and comments. All right, you guys, you've heard me speak a lot about Neeme Skincare. I love what their three-step anti-aging routine has done for my skin, which is why I'm also excited that Neeme Skincare now has a complete body line as well, their Foundations body bundle. It's a simple three-step routine. You get the Botanical Bliss body wash to gently cleanse with soothing botanicals, the revitalizing sugar scrub to exfoliate and hydrate with vitamin C plus coconut oil, and the restorative body lotion to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy. And just like their facial skincare, the Neeme body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients.
