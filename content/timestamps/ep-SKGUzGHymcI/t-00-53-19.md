## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I said Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s girlfriend. I meant Kash's girlfriend. Thank you for correcting me. Bigfoot Believer. Oh, sorry. Elodium writes, my bet is it's connected to the Macrons. They rang the MK Ultra Red phone to get you off their backs. Plus, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was now an issue to them. One stone, two birds. It's just me thinking out loud and speculating, but... You know, a lot of people wrote that instantly they did this intentionally because you were on the track of Brigitte Macron we were getting real close talking about that MK Ultra experiment that happened that I believe it looked very much like prisoner 2093 could have been Jean-Michel Trogneux. And then this happens. And I did not at all think there could be a connection, but this French angle is weird.
