## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We have, I mean, fundraiser over there. We have Elizabeth McCoy, the amazing Mike McCoy's wife. We have Tyler Bowyer, we have Erika (Erika Kirk). There could be more people. We need to focus here. There's a fact that's not connecting for me when I look at this, a fact that I have about how things were running that day. And so if you have information, maybe you're at Turning Point USA, at who left at what time, Turning Point headquarters, Elizabeth McCoy screamed, she grabbed her phone, she ran out. Mikey probably called her, that would make sense. And that's about 30 minutes away from the airport.
