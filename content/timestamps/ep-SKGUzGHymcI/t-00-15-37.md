## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You will likely get 920 North King Street with the label Federal Bureau of Investigation. Instead of the public FBI address that's at 500 Delaware Avenue, Suite 300, which is just a bank tower, you can confirm that 500 Delaware Ave is the borough's public-facing spot, but Google will tell you that 920 North King Street is also the FBI. That is not a mistake. The FBI is also stationed at 920 North King Street. They list it straight in the DOJ's 1990s directory. Further, the Secret Service is not a part of the Department of Justice. They are the Department of Homeland Security.
