Instead of the public FBI address that's at 500 Delaware Avenue, Suite 300, which is just a bank tower, you can confirm that 500 Delaware Ave is the borough's public-facing spot, but Google will tell you that 920 North King Street is also the FBI. That is not a mistake. The FBI is also stationed at 920 North King Street. They list it straight in the DOJ's 1990s directory. Further, the Secret Service is not a part of the Department of Justice. They are the Department of Homeland Security.
