## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> In fact, when we were driving into that event, this is the first event I've gone to a college campus with Charlie (Charlie Kirk). He said, Frank, if you can come help me the first couple of days, could you stay an extra day and come with me to the first event? I said, of course. So we're driving in Megyn and his team has drones up looking at the crowd from above and they text him some video. And there's thousands of people there an hour before the start. And I said, Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I don't like this place. There's too many buildings. And, uh, but he shrugged it off. He knew there were thousands of people there and he knew in order to minister to people, you can't completely isolate yourself. It's just like love. You, you, you can't keep your heart in a box.
