## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then they land into Provo at 3:31 p.m. The last plane that we have here is one that departed Santa Barbara at 2:19 p.m. local. That's actually quite late. I want to draw your attention to that. That's a smaller airplane and it's quite late because that's going to be 3:19 p.m. Utah time. That's three hours after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got shot. That person is just leaving Santa Barbara. Passengers don't know. Here are the passengers that we know came from Arizona and potentially Santa Barbara. Andrew (Andrew Kolvet), Andrew Kolvet's wife. We have a priest. We have Stacey Sheridan, who's the chief finance person.
