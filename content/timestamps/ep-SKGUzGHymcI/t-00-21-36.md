## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I mean, I read this, checked it, verified it, and I just want to know why Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I want to know why the decision was made to murder Charlie (Charlie Kirk), a decision that very clearly had to be approved by Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s friends. That's all I have. I wanna know why. I think we deserve to know why. And instead, we're gonna be sued, I guess. Is this gonna be the pathway forward? Are you gonna start murdering more people in broad daylight for knowing? Is that our consequence? Is that the slave consequence? Is that catching a slave and cutting off their limbs?
