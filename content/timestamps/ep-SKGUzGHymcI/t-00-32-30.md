## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So Brian Harpole lied. You see, I used to lay in my grandma's bed and watch Judge Judy with my grandma growing up. And a lot of it, actually, my grandma had a bad hip. So she sometimes had surgeries and we'd watch Judge Judy. And I remember in my brain, maybe Judge Judy made me like this, I don't know. But she used to say, if you lie, you better have a good memory. That's the problem with lies. You gotta have a real good memory to lie when you're telling the truth. You don't have to have a good memory because it just happened. So you just say it. And Turning Point is not having a very good memory right now. And it's hard because they did so much speaking in the aftermath that they can't go back and delete files. And so we can add that to our list now of verifiable Turning Point lies.
