## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> "Nor am I an operator anywhere near Egypt or its planes, but I do know that only federal vehicles are allowed access to private gates housing government planes." "Because of this, I can guarantee you that the vehicles affiliated with this workspace arrived and left inside the same window as SUBTT." "Government vehicles either pick up, monitor, or escort every government plane that lands there." "So that's the standard." "It's every single one." "Feds don't just leave foreign government planes unwatched." "It's a government plane, not a ghost plane." "Someone has to come out, and we all know they're not going to just call an Uber."
