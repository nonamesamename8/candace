## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> 920 North King Street has been a federal resident office since at least 1997, and today it houses the DEA, the FBI, and the United States Secret Service all at the same address. The hangar the plane would have used is controlled through a DRBA lease that itself is nested in federal waterways. The FBI also publicly talks about key partners in Wilmington on the same year that the hangar reactivates. I'm going to skip this next portion because he tells me how I can verify this. And like I said, I did that. Once more, go through this logic and ask yourself how this makes any sense.
