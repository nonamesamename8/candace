## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They're saving people, just like you, an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in the low fives, which is a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before we know it, so do not wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today. You can call American Financing at 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210, or visit americanfinancing.net/owens, americanfinancing.net/owens. All right, you guys, some housekeeping. Book club is going to be tomorrow at six o'clock p.m. Eastern.
