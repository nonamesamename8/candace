## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Thousand Oaks is a part of Calvary Global Network. It is always about infiltration and I have to say I can't change what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) but I just wish I was there because I always warned him about certain people. This very people that the world has now kind of switched on to and going what's up with these people. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was just so motivated and I think that he acquitted more dollars with more success and didn't acquit necessarily with more of a threat. But Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not die in vain, obviously, because we are having this conversation because of what happened to him. Bigfoot Believer writes, with everything that you've uncovered, is there any chance our extremely unserious government will ever prosecute Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s killers? If not, Kash Patel's FBI may be the next.
