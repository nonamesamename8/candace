## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> Today is really fun because Mikey and Blake are going to talk about their last trip with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to Asia. And Mikey, you are now in the driver's seat. The floor is yours. Yeah. It's crazy to think that was just three, four days before Utah. And it was Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s dream to always go to Asia. And Blake and I got the gift of being able to tag along for that. And so I brought the camera with me. I've never traveled with the camera before, but I decided it would be a good idea to mic Charlie (Charlie Kirk) up, do some content with him while we're there. Okay?
