## Transcript

**Tucker Carlson:**

Slander of a kind that's so severe— like, how do you get past that? I think we should force ourselves. I interviewed Nick Fuentes to attack my wife and my son and my dad. He attacked my dad. And I interviewed him anyway. I choked it back. And I thought to myself, "I'm just—I want to hear this." And I'm just going to make—I try to make myself do that. So if tomorrow John Podhoretz is like—or whomever I'm mad at, right? People I used to know are calling me a Nazi. It's like, "You know, I don't think he's actually a Nazi." Like, let's have a real conversation. Let's do the best for America. They should all be accepted. I don't think we should have permanent enemies who are American citizens.
