## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You'd be like, why are you doing that? Why do I feel like you're trying to program me? This only made me more interested in Mikey and the McCoy story. And I wanna be super clear here: knowing y'all, though, I don't think that—I know that Mikey McCoy did not kill Charlie Kirk.
