## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Also, I want to tell you guys about Fatty15. I'm excited to share with you guys C15, which is from Fatty15—the first emerging essential fatty acid to be discovered in more than 90 years. It's an incredible scientific breakthrough to support our long-term health, wellness, and healthy aging. Based on over 100 studies, we now know that C15 strengthens our cells and is a key healthy aging nutrient which helps slow biological aging at the cellular level. When our cells don't have enough C15, they become fragile, and they age faster. And thankfully, Fatty15 repairs age-related damage to cells, and it protects them from future breakdown. And it activates pathways in the body that help regulate our sleep, our cognitive health, and naturally repair our repair mechanisms.
