## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Why do they care about Egyptian planes that were there? It's kind of coming together. There's a picture here that's coming together. Anyways, you guys, we have to jump off because we do have book club tonight. So I will see you guys in the Zionist infiltration on our book club. We finally did it, guys. We went viral, and they're stealing clips from behind the paywall. If you guys would like to support our work, you know, you can go to CandaceOwens.com. You can go to MakeHimASandwich.com to buy the book. You will really enjoy this book. It's really important—especially for women to understand where these feminist ideals came from. And beyond that, we will see you guys tomorrow.
