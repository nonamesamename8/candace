## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys. Let's jump right back into it, back into the investigation because I have some incredibly interesting updates for you. Actually, some explosive revelations regarding the Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) case. Now buckle up because there's this country that's only the size of New Jersey. It's always the victim. It turns out that they had some people on the ground that day. And I just want to be clear here: no matter what I say throughout this episode, please remember that they are always the victim, historically have always been the victim, and they have done nothing wrong. Didn't do nothing wrong on 9/10 either. In other news, the McCoys. Let's jump back into their story because I've learned some crazy, interesting data points to add to our timeline.
