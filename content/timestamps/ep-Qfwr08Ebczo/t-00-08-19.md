## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I don't see this intrinsic evil when I look at Mikey McCoy's eyes, but however, I do think he was hyped, okay? I think Mikey was promised or told or encouraged that he would become the new Charlie Kirk. And it is a fact that that was the number one sentiment that we received from our Turning Point USA insiders following Charlie Kirk's assassination—that the, you know, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Mikey McCoy appeared to have like an extra spring in his step that made them all a little bit uncomfortable in the aftermath, and that he seemed all too happy to assume Charlie Kirk's position. Look, he's already speaking at Liberty University. Why? Because he made some phone calls?
