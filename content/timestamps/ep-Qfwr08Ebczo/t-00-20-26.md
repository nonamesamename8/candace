## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Right out the gate, Benjamin Netanyahu doing propaganda rounds, denying that he had anything to do with the assassination of Charlie Kirk—perfectly normal thing to do, right? Perfectly normal. For some reason, I didn't feel compelled to do that. I didn't feel like I had to get on camera and make a statement that I didn't kill Charlie Kirk, but Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi Net and Yahoo) felt that he needed to do that. And all of his sicko fans in America echoed that statement, and nobody had accused them. A thief runneth when no one pursueth, right? Well, here's some explosive news for you that I can now, beyond a shadow of a doubt, confirm. Putting my name on this.
