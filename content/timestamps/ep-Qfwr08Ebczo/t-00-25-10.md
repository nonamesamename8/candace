## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like it. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. And you can do that for just $28. That's what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion. $28 helps her to see the light that is growing inside of her. It gives her truth that our culture doesn't. So don't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. Be unapologetically pro-life. Go to preborn.org/Candace Owens right now. You can give $28, or you can give 10 times that amount if you'd like to. This is definitely the line that we have to stand on. If we stand for truth, we have to do what's right, and we can save lives from abortion and stand firm in our gospel. Again, preborn.org/Candace Owens to provide an ultrasound for just $28.
