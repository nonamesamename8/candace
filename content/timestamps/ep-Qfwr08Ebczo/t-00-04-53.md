## Transcript

**Erika Kirk:**
> Let me tell you something about Mikey. Mikey's been with Charlie Kirk for several years. He's 23 years old. He is wise beyond his years. And when that tragedy struck, Mikey was an absolute hero who kept everybody calm and did some of the most mundane things you would think you would need to do on the worst day of his life. And he continues to be a rock. He's been following Jesus for a long time. I'm hoping that Mikey one day will follow in Charlie Kirk's footsteps right to the college campus because he has the ability, the demeanor, the grace, the knowledge to do so.
