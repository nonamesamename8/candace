## Transcript

**SPEAKER_5:**
> Utah Valley University has provided the document that created the rally at which conservative activist Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot to death. But it is not providing the security plan for that day. I'm Fox 13 investigative reporter Nate Carlisle. We've been asking UVU for records related to the September 10th Kirk rally. After about six weeks, this is the first record provided. It's the application submitted mid-July by the UVU chapter of Kirk's Turning Point USA. The applicants answer standard questions about time, place, and a description of the event. However, we noticed there is one question not asked on the form: whether organizers need any police protection.

## Claims Made

- [factual] It's the application submitted mid-July by the UVU chapter of Kirk's Turning Point USA.
  - *Follow-up:* UVU public records
