## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Wouldn't say he strikes me as something else entirely. And he similarly had some rather impeccable timing. Rob McCoy, as you very well know, was the senior pastor of the Godspeak Calvary Chapel in Thousand Oaks, California. You should also know, by the way—let me introduce this to you right now—because I didn't know that he was funded; his church was funded by the Wilks Brothers down in Texas. The Wilks Brothers are the ones that fund DailyWire, the initial seed money behind DailyWire—not the initial seed money behind PragerU, but they majorly fund PragerU as well. So that's an interesting web that's being woven before our eyes, right?
