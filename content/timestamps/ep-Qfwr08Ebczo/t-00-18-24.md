## Transcript

**SPEAKER_5:**
> That's a standard inquiry at, for example, University of Utah events. Speaking of police, UVU has denied FOX 13 News' request for a copy of the Kirk Rally security plan. The university is citing the provision in state records laws, keeping confidential, quote, "security measures," end quote. The campus also has expressed concern that the records could interfere in any investigation and someone's right to a fair trial. Tyler Robinson is charged with Kirk's murder. Fox 13 plans an appeal of the denial, and we are still pursuing a variety of records related to the Kirk shooting.
