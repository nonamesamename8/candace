## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And if you're wondering why we also included Erika saying "the amazing Mikey McCoy" in her first speech, it's because Rob McCoy oddly refers back to Erika's speech when he is asked specifically what he believes Mikey's future is going to be at Turning Point USA, okay?
