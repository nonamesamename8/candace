## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You're definitely not going to convince me that that's the first five books of the Bible, okay? I know what your faith is. It's Zionism, okay? You guys behave like gangsters. You behave like you are only loyal to one another, and you'll come beat up any person—figuratively. You'll take care of any person that gets in your way. And the world can see that now. So what's your next move? To just keep doing this, to just keep behaving like this, and just know that every act that you make—every show, everything that you make go viral with you speaking in the way that you speak—and then people get to hear Tucker Carlson. He gets bigger, and you get smaller, okay? He gets bigger. Our ideas get bigger. Your ideas get smaller because people can perceive the nastiness that's guiding it, and they want nothing to do with it, okay?
