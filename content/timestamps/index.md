# Timestamps

This folder contains timestamp pages organized by episode. Each episode has its own subfolder with individual timestamp entries.

Timestamps are extracted from episode transcripts and linked to entities, events, and claims mentioned at that point in the video.

---

To browse timestamps, navigate to a specific episode from the [Episodes Index](/index/episodes) and click on any timestamp link.
