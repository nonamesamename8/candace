## Transcript

**Wolves and Finance:**
> Anyways, he then goes on to describe how they conducted their own audit using a firm called Baker Tilly. I'll let him take it away. What about Tyler Bowyer's argument that they have an annual financial audit every year? If what I am saying is true, why wouldn't their annual audit catch these issues? The annual financial audit for Turning Point USA, Inc. and its affiliates was performed by an accounting firm called Baker Tilly. In the notes, they explain that they audited Turning Point USA, Turning Point Action, Turning Point Endowment, America's Turning Point, and TPUSA Merch. That usually means they audited all the shell companies when they provided their opinion that the statements present fairly in all material respects.
