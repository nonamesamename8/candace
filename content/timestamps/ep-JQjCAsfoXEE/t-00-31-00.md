## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Dose is a powerful all-in-one wellness shot that helps support gut health, immunity, energy, and all the stuff that really matters when you don't have time to slow down. And let's be honest: when you've got a big and busy family, slowing down is not always an option. It takes me literally five seconds in the morning, and I feel a difference all day long. The best seller that they have is Dose for Your Liver, which was formulated to cleanse your liver of unwanted elements, aid digestion, and maintain your body's filter. Dose's clinical results showed lowering liver enzyme levels by 50% in most of their participants. One shot of Dose for Your Liver is equivalent to 17 shots of turmeric juice. Dose is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, and vegan. Stick with Dose, and you will feel the incredible benefits over time: more energy, better digestion, reduced bloating, healthier liver enzyme function, reduction in brain fog, and better sleep.
