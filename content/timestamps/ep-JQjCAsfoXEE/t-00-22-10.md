Another possibility is that a military jet—particularly one from a foreign country—would likely be equipped with encrypted satellite-based communications capabilities. If you wanted to make an untraceable phone call, as an example, that would be a good place to do so because only the NSA would be able to intercept that call. And it's pretty obvious that the deep state doesn't seem particularly interested in the assassination of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So that'd be a safe place to communicate on that plane.
