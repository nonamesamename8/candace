## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like I said, this plane was not just with her in America; it was also tracking her overseas as well. I flagged this because I was alarmed because I thought it was tracking Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I am telling you that this plane—in addition to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and primarily actually—was tracking Erika. Now, let's get to the day of the assassination. On the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, we know the yellow plane took off in the morning, but the blue plane did not take off in the morning. The blue plane, SU-BND, did, however, power on. And I want to be very clear as to what I mean when I say that this plane was on. I am saying that it was transponding, okay? It's transponding at the FBO at Duncan Aviation, a private terminal.
