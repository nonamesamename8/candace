## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> I want to read you a passage out of Romans. It says in Romans 12:15 and 16, "Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion." I think that's a fitting verse. I mean, we're hearing all kinds of speculation about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and what he believed and didn't believe. And I just have to tell you, this is not the time for it. It's a time to minister to the family. They have a husband and a father to bury. We have a friend to bury, a brother to bury, a son to bury. And the world is mourning. And this is not the time to get clicks.
