## Transcript

**Wolves and Finance:**
> Those three financial statements are still missing. So to be clear, that was another point that they gaslit me on when I told you that it was unusual that seven days before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, he said that he wanted to establish DOGE, right? Tyler came out and lied, and he said, "This is just totally regular." And Alex Clark said, "Oh, every year since I've been here, this is what we do." And the guy starts this video by being like, "You have to be an idiot to accept that as an answer," of course, doing an audit has nothing to do with internally establishing a DOGE, right? He recognized that something was wrong at the organization. And as I told you—okay, because I do not miss on these things—he was not just concerned about where the money was going; he was concerned about where it was coming from.
