## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> On October 11th, when I infamously tweeted about the Egyptian military plane that left Provo on the morning of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, I got the time zone wrong by a couple of hours. And they completely overreacted. I mean, an account that didn't even exist wrote, "Oh, the time zone is wrong." Next thing you know, it was trending. And they pretended it had been officially debunked just because the departure time was wrong. But that wasn't even enough for them. They were so alarmed, and I wasn't—I was off air at that time, right? I took a two-week break. They still found something to scandalize when I wasn't even on air, something that I didn't even say.
