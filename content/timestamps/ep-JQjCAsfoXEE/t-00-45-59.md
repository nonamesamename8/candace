**Candace Owens:**
> I'll also remind you guys about American Financing because the Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that is great news for American homeowners. If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. Well, the rates dropping now is the perfect time to pay off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They are saving people just like you an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in low fives—which is a complete game changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, which will give you extra breathing room for the holidays. It costs absolutely nothing to find out how much you could be saving. The holidays are going to be here before we know it. So don't wait. Call their salary-based mortgage consultants today.
