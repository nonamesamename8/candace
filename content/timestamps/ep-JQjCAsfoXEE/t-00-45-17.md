## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Right now, you can get unlimited talk, unlimited text, and unlimited data with a 30-gig hotspot for just $29.95 a month for life. This is PureTalk's top-tier plan, which is normally $65 a month. Right now, through December 7th, you can get all of this for just $29.95 a month. You're saving over 50% a month every month for life, and it's all on their crazy fast 5G network. But this offer is extremely short-lived, so do not wait. Go to puretalk.com/Owens for PureTalk's best unlimited plan for just $29.95 a month for life. Make the switch in as little as 10 minutes. You can keep your phone, keep your number, and start saving with their unlimited for life plan. Again, that's puretalk.com/Owens to switch to my wireless company, PureTalk.
