## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> 68 overlaps. I have since been able to add now 73 times that this overlapped, okay? And 29 of those instances also happened to include Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was also present. And that's what I was stumbling upon when I was looking into this. I was like, "Why is this plane where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is?" The flights were majority clustered within five states: Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Delaware, and Utah. And it's a pattern that she believes is statistically not random. I'm telling you, this information has been completely verified.
