## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> No matter how many times I watched that clip of me talking about Martin Luther King Boulevard and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Boulevard, I do not get from that that Erika Kirk killed her husband, but that's what they went with. Those were talking points that were delivered to them. They were supposed to go out of the gate with that. The question is why, okay? Retrospectively, that was a clue. They were panicking. They were trying to pretend—me saying that everyone betrayed him, which obviously was not about Erika (Kirk). It also wasn't about Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s mother or Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s father or Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s children—but they were specifically trying to struggle session that into a slight against Erika rather than more obviously suggesting that people at Turning Point USA betrayed him, which Erika Kirk was not an employee of leading up to his death. Why were they doing that? Then, of course, that made me only look further into the Egyptian planes, and I discovered that the planes had been tracking Charlie (Charlie Kirk).
