## Transcript

**Wolves and Finance:**
> And what I can tell you about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is that if Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got clued into something—if Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was at first trusting his lieutenant and then he suddenly said, "Wait a second, what's going on over here?" And he decided that he wanted to figure something out, he would have figured that ish out by sundown. Okay, that is how brilliant he was. If it had his attention, he would have figured it out by sundown. What did Charlie (Charlie Kirk) discover? Is my question, okay? Now, to correct something that he says there: he says four months before—that's the regular tax deadline. It is actually normal for big companies to file for a tax extension, but they missed that deadline as well. I think that was October 15th was the tax extension deadline. They have missed them both. And that is completely abnormal. And he is correct.
