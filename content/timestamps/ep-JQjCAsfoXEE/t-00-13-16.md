## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Andrew K. Smith out of nowhere does this "Restaurantology" interview with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and so Charlie (Charlie Kirk) flew into Salt Lake to make this interview happen. That to me felt like an oddity. Okay, because in a typical scenario, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is not going to be incentivized to go out of his way. Because he would only do it, actually, if there was A, a big donor on the hook—and maybe that's what he was told: "This guy's gonna give a ton of money to Turning Point USA"—or B, because it was a major political person. Otherwise, for the sake of a podcast, people travel to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), okay? If you want to get Charlie (Charlie Kirk), you're gonna travel to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to make that happen. He's not gonna go out of his way. To me, the common thing that always happened was they would set up an interview in an empty room at the campus.
