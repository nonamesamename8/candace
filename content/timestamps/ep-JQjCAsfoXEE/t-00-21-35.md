## Transcript

> On September 10th, the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, this plane first transponded from 9:05 a.m. plus 36 seconds until it was turned off at 10:34 a.m. and five seconds. Then the plane turned back on; the transponder was turned back on just 17 minutes after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot, at 12:40 p.m. and 53 seconds, and it stayed on until 1:29 p.m. and 40 seconds. So what was the blue plane doing sitting on the tarmac? We can only imagine what it was doing, okay? We can run a couple of options here.
