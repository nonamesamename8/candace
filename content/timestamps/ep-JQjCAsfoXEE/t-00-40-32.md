> Yeah, that sounds highly suspicious to me—especially when you add in the fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wanted to establish a DOGE seven days before he died; once you also add the fact that they're all telling strange lies; when you also add in the fact that there was this weird psychological campaign to tell us not to look at Turning Point USA, or we're going to go to hell—essentially, they're like using a biblical passage to tell us why it's not moral. Do they think we are this soft and persuadable?
