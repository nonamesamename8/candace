## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And Butch writes: have you seen the new Sean Ryan with the security detail that took care of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Do you feel they are trying to push their narrative? We love you, Candace (Candace Owens). We're praying for you always. I have not seen it yet, but I intend to watch it, and I will give feedback on it this week without question. It's on my to-do list. Emma White writes: Candace (Candace Owens), I run ops for a nonprofit. Baker Tilly also is the company that files their 990s per the first page. Their audits are not considered valid. A separate company has to do an independent audit. Okay, very interesting that you're saying that. Again, we're reading comments live. So this is allegedly Baker Tilly—don't come after me. But yeah, that video went deeper into some lawsuits that Baker Tilly was facing for not auditing things correctly. Now that could be commonplace.
