## Transcript

**Wolves and Finance:**
> It looks like it was never turned in. This is a massive red flag. So Tyler Bowyer is being snarky on X.com and telling people to go look at the annual financial audit, but the financial audit is missing from last year for three of the four organizations. This strange decision to hide their financial statements happened four months before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was murdered. I will repeat for clarity. Someone at Turning Point decided not to file three of the four of their annual financial statements four months before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) appointed a new COO, requested a new audit, and was murdered.
