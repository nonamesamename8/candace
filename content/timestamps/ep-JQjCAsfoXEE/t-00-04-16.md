## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I am so grateful about where I started my life in St. John's Towers. I look at that building now; it's such pride. And I am grateful to have not grown up with a silver spoon in my mouth because it fortified my character, and it gave me a lot of common sense, basic survival skills. It requires gut instinct. And I had to learn at a very young age to read people. I think that's my superpower, actually—just being able to look at someone and sense danger or sense deceit. I can just look at Rob (Pastor Rob McCoy). And for me, it's a no. It's obviously a no. Same thing, by the way, I should mention with Steven Crowder. I have never been a fan. He just always gave me the energy of a pathological liar. I trust my gut. I don't trust influencer campaigns.
