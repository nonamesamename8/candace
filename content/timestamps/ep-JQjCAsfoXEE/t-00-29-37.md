## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So let's take a break. All right, you guys. Too many people have been vilified for standing up for the truth. Obviously, so many people have felt the sting of injustice, but also a lot of people right now are feeling courage. I'm definitely done playing defense. I no longer water down what I believe to be palatable. Silence is not kindness. Silence is consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds the topic of the lives that are lost before they even take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like it. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love for just $28. That's what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion. Just $28 will help her to see the life that's growing inside of her, to give her the truth that our culture will not. So don't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission.
