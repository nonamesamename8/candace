## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Be bold. Be clear. Be unapologetically pro-life. Go to preborn.org/Candace right now. Give $28. You can give 10 times that if you're able to. This is a line that we need to stand on. We have to stand for truth and what's right. And we have to save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also gonna tell you guys about Dose because I think we all know that the modern-day diet is taking a toll on Americans. Processed foods, there's hidden ingredients, there's sugar in practically everything. We're seeing liver health concerns rise in the U.S. because of this, and there's one trusted solution out there that I trust to take care of my liver health, and that is Dose.
