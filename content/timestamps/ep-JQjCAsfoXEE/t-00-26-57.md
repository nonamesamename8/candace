## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Maybe you were in Santa Barbara; maybe you were in Scottsdale. Somebody saw something, and I'm asking you to email us more tips at CandaceOwens.com. I am interested in that flight. We're not done yet. There's more. I know something else about the Egyptian flights. This time, another mommy sleuth. I learned that oddly, Duncan Aviation—you know, where that plane was transponding from, the FBO in Provo—sourced rental cars for these quote-unquote Egyptians when they landed a couple of days before this operation. I didn't just learn that; I actually have the license plate numbers for four of the vehicles that they rented.
