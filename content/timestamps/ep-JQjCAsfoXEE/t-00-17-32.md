## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I am showing you this on a spreadsheet now. These are all the instances in which this plane—all 68 instances that this plane crossed with Erika. And I'm also gonna say this includes overseas as well. So my instant question becomes: why didn't Turning Point acknowledge that this plane was familiar to them?

Turning Point just stays silent. They know he's lying, but they allow the lie to flow. Alex Clark lies; I get attacked.
