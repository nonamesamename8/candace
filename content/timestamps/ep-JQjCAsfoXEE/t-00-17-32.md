## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I am showing you this on a spreadsheet now. These are all the instances in which this plane—all 68 instances that this plane crossed with Erika. And I'm also gonna say this includes overseas as well. So my instant question becomes: why didn't Turning Point acknowledge that this plane was familiar to them? When I was taking all of these figurative online bullets, someone could have easily said something, right? That's kind of a repeat thing in this investigation. Josh Hammer lies; I get attacked.
