> Another point that I'd like to follow up with, Andrew Kolvet: let's stick with you. Is that in the hospital on that day, you told me—you were in the hospital—that you were told that there was a credible threat against me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson). Specifically, you told me that me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) were on a list and that you were just telling me as a friend that me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) should lay low. And after you told me that, I ended our phone call, and I immediately called Tucker (Tucker Carlson). And I said—hey, terrified, obviously crying all day—and told him that he and I have to lay low because there's a credible threat. And it is now really living inside me that you did not tell me who that threat was from. I assumed the feds told you, but I asked you the question: why wouldn't the feds call me directly if there was a threat against my life? No such call has come in.
