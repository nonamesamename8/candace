## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So close, Charlie (Charlie Kirk). There was so much unity, so much excitement, so much resurgence in faith and newfound interest in faith, and now there is discord, so many distractions, and that is just like Satan who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. He is called the Great Accuser. He is the sower of discord, the author of confusion. The reason I haven't weighed in on things is I am an eyewitness to events, and they said, "Don't comment on things because anything you say can mess that up." I don't want to mess up any trial for the person who did this. Well, events is a thousand percent right. But Candace (Candace Owens) is well within her rights to suggest certain things and all this, and she has the right to free speech and all that. That's fine. She's right to ask questions. I just think it is hurtful and not helpful when you cross a line to strongly suggest somebody's guilty of something for which you have no evidence. Challenge accepted, Frank Turek. Let's go, Max, today.
