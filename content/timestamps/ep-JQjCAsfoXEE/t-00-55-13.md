Candace (Candace Owens) journalism is the new standard. We are pioneering something, and we definitely are. It's never been done like this. No one has ever decentralized the intelligence.

I don't think that's ever happened. I think we're making history. We may not be here when it's celebrated, but we're making history, and what we do today actually does matter. I know that. And I don't care what any of these people say.
