## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We showed you guys this, right? We created this document, and we organized it to SU-BND being the blue plane and then tail number SU-BTT being the yellow plane. That seems to have struck even more fear into the nest of mockingbirds. In fact, they sent Mother Mockingbird out—Ben Shapiro—to make the exact same wild allegation out of thin air that I said something specifically about Erika when I had not. Again, I'll ask the question: why Erika? Why didn't Ben on stage say, "She accused Mikey or Rob (Pastor Rob McCoy)"? I've done multiple episodes now on Mikey, on Rob (Pastor Rob McCoy), speaking about Andrew Kolvet, Alex Clark. Why were they kept? Why do they keep going back to Erika?
