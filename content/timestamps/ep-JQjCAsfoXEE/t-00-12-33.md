## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And it must've been so new that it was over by the next event after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died because he wasn't there again. So he just out of the blue was at this event, and then he wasn't, and he secured the SD cards. Okay, it was something that I noticed that the rest of the world would not have taken as a concrete fact. It is also how I felt—and I'm sharing this with you now for a reason—when I learned that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) flew into Salt Lake City that morning. Because why didn't he fly into the much closer Provo airport? Now, ostensibly, the answer is because he had an interview with a person that nobody really knows. He's a managing director of a restaurant fund.
