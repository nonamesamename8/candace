## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> At UVU campus, they would have had this guy in the corner, and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have flown into Provo. So I felt—again, didn't share it at this time—that they diverted Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to Salt Lake City for a reason. Something else you should know about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was obsessed with planes. My husband and him actually shared this in common, where every time we'd board a plane, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would know exactly—like, way too many facts about the plane. If we boarded an old American Airlines flight, he'd be like, "Oh, they actually took these planes out of service in the 1970s." He just had a lot of Snapple facts when it came to planes—something that I just do not dedicate any of my time to learning about. He really liked planes and knowing everything about them. And more crucially, I want you guys to understand this: Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had a photographic memory. He did.
