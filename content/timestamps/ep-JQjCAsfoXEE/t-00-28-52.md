## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now to the students at UVU: please check your phones, your pictures from that day, because if any of those cars were seen at UVU or around campus on that day, then we're gonna be able to suspect something else. Check a few hotels, maybe a gas station. Maybe you work somewhere; look at those lights. Look for those plates during that timeframe from when those cars were there until they departed. Somebody will be able to connect it somewhere. And of course, the email address to send it to is moretips@CandaceOwens.com. It's only Monday, folks. I've actually discovered a lot more, but it's only Monday.
