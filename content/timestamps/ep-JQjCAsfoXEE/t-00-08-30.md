## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> If they try to give me a holiday, what is with them giving people a holiday after they kill them? Why is that a thing? You know what I mean? Like, oh, Martin Luther King—what about this holiday? What about this boulevard? Anyways, let me knock out—like, they're gonna give Charlie (Charlie Kirk) a boulevard. They already did. They did in Israel. They gave him a freaking boulevard. It's like, as soon as they give you a boulevard and a holiday, they definitely killed you. Okay, there's no question. They killed you. There's no way. That's like their signature thing. It's like that's what they do. It's their signature. They sign off after they murder you. They're like, "Holiday and a boulevard." And it's never on the nice side of town either. Like Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Boulevard is not gonna be on the nice side of town. Anyways, I will be back on the 27th, you guys. Thank you guys for all the support throughout these couple of weeks, these last really kind of six weeks since Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died.
