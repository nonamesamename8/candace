## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's because they were talking about the horrific murder of Irina Zarutska." This is where I say that no civilized nation uses the death penalty (in parentheses, referring to his own thoughts). Now, another user then jumped on that and tried to establish a non-fact that the footage of Irina's murder was released on that day, on the 9th, and that's why Josh tweeted that. All of this is factually untrue, okay? Irina was murdered on August 22nd. Her perpetrator was arrested that same day, and the footage was released and trended on X on September 5th. Josh himself sent multiple tweets regarding the homicide, as everyone did, because, like I said, it was trending.
