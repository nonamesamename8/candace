## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So we have gone ahead and highlighted for you where I am looking for footage from, okay? I can't find footage from this section. Chris, if you could go back to that first one again, too. This section right here—if you were sitting here—or go to the next one, all on the side, when the shots rang out or just before, maybe in the 10 minutes before—so I can see who was around or what happened when those shots rang out. It is weird. It's like a black hole. Cannot get footage of that angle from the front. You're probably going, "Well, doesn't Turning Point have that footage?" Well, Turning Point, as we have learned, is not going to show anybody anything in 4K or in 5K.
