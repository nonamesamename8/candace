## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I'm grateful thus far that I did not pay any greater cost than them destroying my reputation and my name and trying to get me canceled everywhere. Dennis Domian writes, "In times where deception grows, truth-tellers matter most. Thank you, Candace (Candace Owens). Your courage gives hope. Greetings from Croatia. Christ is King." Tell you a story. I used to live in Croatia for a couple of months—about three months—working on a wedding in Dubrovnik. Josie Ells writes, "God bless you. We are rooting for you from Australia." I hope you're rooting for me to get into Australia. "By uncovering the flaws in the U.S., you've opened our eyes to the demonism that we are under in our own government, too. I can't wait for them to approve your visa so that we can show you some Aussie love." Even that—you know—it's up to the Supreme Court or the High Court of Australia.
