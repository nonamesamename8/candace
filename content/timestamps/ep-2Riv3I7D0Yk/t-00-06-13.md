## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And the truth is that is now an established fact, like I said, that Josh Hammer knew that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s perspectives on Israel were changing. And since that announcement, Twitter users pointed out a very strange tweet that Josh Hammer hit send on 16 hours before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated, for no apparent reason at all. He retweeted something that President Donald Trump had sent a full 12 years ago about public executions. Here it is. Here is that retweet. Trump wrote on April 19th, 2013: "Should be public execution for all to see. You will end this bull fast." And Josh Hammer just replies and says, "Based," you can see.
