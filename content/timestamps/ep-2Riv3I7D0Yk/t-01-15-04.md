## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Join us in prison when Laura Loomer sends us for writing CIA in parody. And it's a parody because we don't want to be in the CIA. We think there's a lot of corruption there. Actually, I'm hoping one day my team will let me have the green hat. They never sent it to me. So hopefully if you know someone—somebody get me that green CIA hat because it's actually—people are tagging me in, and I don't have it. And it's really nice. Other than that, you guys, thank you so much for your support, and we'll see you tomorrow.
