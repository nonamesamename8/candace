## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Also want to tell you guys about Neeme skincare because there is a reason that we all love the fall: the crisp air, there's changing leaves, the season of transition. But that transition is tough on our skin sometimes. The end of the summer sun, the new autumn wind can leave us feeling tired, dry, dull. If you're looking in the mirror and you're feeling like your skin has lost its radiance with the season, then I should tell you about my absolute go-to: Neeme Skincare. Neeme is the reason that my skin stays clear, firm, glowing, no matter what the weather brings. Their three-step anti-aging routine is perfect—a perfect defense for the seasonal shift. It's packed with powerful clinically backed ingredients that work to restore your skin's barrier—which is exactly what you need to fight off that dry autumn air. It boosts collagen production. It helps with those fine lines. It locks in deep moisture, and it brightens your complexion, bringing back that healthy glow that you had during the summer.
