## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. Happy Wednesday. Sorry, we're running late today. I'm starting homeschooling, so still getting adjusted to the new schedule. Where should we begin? Okay, well, Josh Hammer, because that's certainly getting a little more interesting, maybe a bit darker than we had anticipated. Because just 16 hours before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated, he mysteriously retweeted a 2013 tweet from Donald Trump calling for public executions. Now I have tried, and I don't feel that there is any way that I can confidently explain to you guys why he tweeted that, least of all in the context of him having already admitted that he and a rabbi in Israel had a long talk with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) the night before he died—something he was very proud of.
