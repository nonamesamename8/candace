## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And of course in the comfort of his own derangement and with the full support of the press and the silence of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s other quote-unquote friends, Josh was really acting the part of a true Pharisee. He was certain that the truth would not rise again. He was so confident he had killed it and that he could himself hijack the legacy of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Except the truth did kind of rise again. It kind of always does rise again. And the world now knows that Josh Hammer had personal intimate knowledge that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s views were changing. He lied about the Hamptons meeting. I've told you the truth from day one. Seth Dillon and Josh were personally upset with Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s defiance against the state of Israel.
