## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He tried to claim definitively that Josh was referring to the criminal who horrifically murdered the Ukrainian refugee, Irina Zarutska, in North Carolina. That was obviously a big story in the beginning of September. Yashar Ali wrote this: "Last night, Candace (Candace Owens) quote-tweeted notorious neo-Nazi Sam Parker, who pointed out that Josh Hammer, who is Jewish and was a friend of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s, elevated a Trump tweet from 2013 the day before, which called for public executions. Candace (Candace Owens), of course, would like people to believe that Josh's quote-tweet is suspicious in the context of the assassination of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). But Josh was just sharing what many conservatives were sharing and stating the day before.
