## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock so that you can protect your equity and find out today if you're already a victim. You can use my promo code CANDACE at HomeTitleLock.com, and you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock protection. That's 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes, and if fraud occurs, their U.S.-based restoration team will spend up to $1 million to fix it. Again, HomeTitleLock.com, promo code CANDACE. I also want to tell you guys about American Financing because the cost of everything is still out of control. Many people are relying on credit cards to cover essentials. If that debt is piling up, you should know you're not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing, but maybe hesitated because you didn't want to give up your low mortgage rate.
