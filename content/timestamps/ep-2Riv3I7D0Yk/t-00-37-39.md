## Transcript

> I've been on the show calling them out by name, saying who was doing what. Mormons were not offended by that at all. Because they want to know if somebody is corrupt and had something to do with this. They want to know if their church was involved in this. That's a normal response: not to say it definitely wasn't us, but rather to say, "I'm on this journey. I want to know who killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk) too, and I'm therefore going to support Candace (Candace Owens)'s efforts to find out." Exact opposite of what Israel is doing, right? That is the one disturbing fact about people that support Israel: their behavior, to put it in a way that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) put it. Take a big—a little bit of a break here and throw it to some of our sponsors. I always tell you guys about Riverbend Ranch because I love their steaks.
