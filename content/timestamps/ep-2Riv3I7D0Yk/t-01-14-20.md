## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I'll give you more details about that tomorrow. You know, I just feel like I need to—I'm arriving at the acceptance phase. I will say the stages of grief is very real. And I just kind of want to take a little bit of time to really just kind of mourn Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in my own personal capacity and just kind of recognize I'm never going to see him again, never talk to him again— to say kind of bye in my own way and take a break and a breather. And so nothing bad is happening to me. I will still be sending an occasional Instagram wave so that you guys know that I'm fine. But I wanted to let you know a heads up what's going on there. Anyways, if you would like to support our show—as many of you guys have—you can head to CandaceOwens.com. You can sign up; you can join our book club. You can buy our—we don't know, no, but we know—brand stuff.
