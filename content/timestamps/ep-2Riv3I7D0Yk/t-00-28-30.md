## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He did. He said no. He didn't flinch. He wasn't even flinching. He was just busy and couldn't make it out to Israel or something. Now I will say that regarding Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, I think he has more of a conscience and soul than Josh Hammer. I haven't seen him promoting his book. He doesn't lie as audaciously and as repeatedly and tweet nearly as neurotically as Josh Hammer does, but I want you to listen to what he had to say when asked whether or not Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was turning on Israel. Give us our hindsight 20/20, Rabbi Pesach Wolicki. (Clip of Rabbi Pesach Wolicki:)
