## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So that security company you see that's around him— he owned it. He actually outright purchased a security company, and it didn't matter. And they didn't do anything. It clearly was an act of vanity. They should never be allowed to work again because why would you not have—I mean, he's a sitting duck. The amount that he was paying for that security for them to not check rooftops. You could have someone actually requiring that you have access to rooftops. You could have one of your guys on a rooftop. Wouldn't that be a good idea? I don't know. I just—I don't understand it. Kelly Gibbs writes, "My Catholic bestie and I keep you in our prayers." Thank you, Kelly, for this gift. "Rosary and divine mercy. I pray that our Lord and Lady protect you and your family, give you wisdom, and safeguard the pearl of great price: the faith passed down from the apostles." Thank you so much.
