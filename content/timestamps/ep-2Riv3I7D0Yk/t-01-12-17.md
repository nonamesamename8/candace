## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You know, Rachel, I'll apologize back because I was also partially blinded, and I thought that it was just the left. You know, I was taking that low-hanging fruit of us warring against each other, and I've realized now like, no, we're all actually fighting real evil, and we're going to disagree along the way. You know, I don't think you should trans your children. I'm against it. I'm very against it. But I also am more interested in where all of these ideologies are coming from. I'm more interested in the war against family. I'm more interested in waking everybody up by actually being more charitable in our interpretations of one another and what motivates us, and less charitable to the government, right? Because they know exactly what they're doing. And that's the real risk. That is the real threat to the government: is left and right actually uniting.
