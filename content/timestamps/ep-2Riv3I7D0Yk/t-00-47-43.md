## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> But it has been something like bombardment, and this morning they sent out Dinesh D'Souza after me. Very convincing, by the way. He sent out a tweet to convince people they shouldn't watch me, he said. "I can't comment on Candace (Candace Owens) because it's quite obviously a freak show. It's like driving on the highway and seeing a farmer having sex with a sheep. You don't want to look, but you can't look away either. The problems begin when you try to analyze it. It is what it is." And I love that Yashar Ali replies and says, "This is what I mean. These are the people who are supposed to be combating Candace (Candace Owens). Instead, they tweet stuff like this." Yeah. Hi, Dinesh. Kinda weird, man.
