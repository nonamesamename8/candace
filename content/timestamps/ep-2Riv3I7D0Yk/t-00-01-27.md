## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Hoisted by his own petard. That's an expression, obviously, that we use a lot. And I have this thing where I always have to go back and research and figure out why we use common expressions, because nobody actually thinks about those things anymore. Well, this one is pretty obvious. It refers to when soldiers would use a petard—essentially a bucket-shaped explosive device packed with gunpowder, effectively a bomb—to blow up the gates and wall fortifications of their enemies. They'd light the fuse. They would be hoisted by their own bombs. And that's exactly what is happening right now to Josh Hammer for weeks after the assassination of Charlie (Charlie Kirk).
