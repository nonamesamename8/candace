## Transcript

**Alex Jones:**
> Boom. Bam. The show. And she'll let them, you know, for a week or so kind of stew and say she's a liar. And then she'll just release it. And then what she's saying is, 'You kill me, it doesn't matter. It's coming out.' And the word is he specifically thought Israel was going to kill him." Even Michael Savage first—a few months ago—said, "Netanyahu needs to go on my show." During the break he goes, "Man, I hope Mossad doesn't kill me." Cruz saw it; it was on the feed. He didn't say it was off-record. It was during the break. So there are a lot of groups that want Charlie (Charlie Kirk) killed. He was defeating the Democrats with TPUSA.
