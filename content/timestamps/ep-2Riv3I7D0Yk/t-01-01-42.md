## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's fantastic. It's funny, and it's good to remind yourself that politics is serious all the time, but most of the people do not behave like psychopaths, and they're very funny and can make fun of themselves. Uh, are going to read a couple sponsors before I get to you guys' comments. We're going to tell you first of all about Home Title Lock because if you are a homeowner, need to listen to this. The FBI has been warning homeowners about a type of real estate fraud on the rise, which is title theft. This type of theft doesn't happen by breaking down your doors and stealing your stuff. It happens with just a one-page document, a forged signature, and it gets filed to the county. And if your title—which is a legal record of your ownership—gets transferred out of your name, criminals can use your ownership to drain your equity or even sell your property. And you won't even know about it until you start getting collection notices or foreclosure notices in the mail.
