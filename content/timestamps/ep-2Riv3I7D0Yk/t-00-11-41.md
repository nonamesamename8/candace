## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And so he throws shade at Donald Trump and Donald Trump's relationship with Qatar, because I guess it would be okay for them to violate international law if Donald Trump wasn't friends with Qatar or something. 11:33 a.m., he tweets against Saudi Arabia because they came out and made a statement against what Israel had done. So he tweets against Saudi Arabia. And then at 3 o'clock p.m., he tweets against Tucker (Tucker Carlson) for telling the truth about Israel and 9/11. Again, he has to do that a couple of times a day. It's part of his ritual. 5:58 p.m., he tweets about the Hebrew Bible being the basis of Western civilization alongside a speech that he had given—tweets a link out.
