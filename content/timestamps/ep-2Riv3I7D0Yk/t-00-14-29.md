## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I can tell you that it is not something that Josh Hammer regularly tweets about or discusses. The first time that he tweeted about a public execution was back in 2013. And he said it in reference—I'm sorry, in 2022—and he said it in reference to the Boston Marathon bombing terrorist account. Oh sorry, the Uvalde shooter. "The Uvalde shooter is apparently dead, but just as with the Buffalo shooter, this level of pure evil would have been another ideal time for a public execution." So to be clear, that makes sense, right?
