## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> Why would he call a meeting with a few pro-Israel friends of his to talk through Israel issues, to make sure that his facts were straight and his talking points were straight so that he could defend Israel better? If he was turning on Israel, he would have had Candace (Candace Owens) and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) in the meeting planning to throw Israel under the bus. The entire premise of the meeting refutes that theory."
