## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I do not accept—and do you guys—that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) lost his life because he really pissed off the trans lobby. It terrifies me to think that on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died, I got multiple phone calls from people who said that me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) should lay low because we're also on the list. And they never told us who specifically told them that, by the way. Now I'm wondering why they never told us who specifically told them that. I called Tucker (Tucker Carlson). I'm like, "I'm hearing—are you hearing me saying anything? I'm hearing that they're saying that we're next." And now I go, was that supposed to be a threat to me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to have us watch the public execution of a friend of ours and then to call us and to say, "You should lay low for a little bit because you guys were hearing that you guys are on a list."
