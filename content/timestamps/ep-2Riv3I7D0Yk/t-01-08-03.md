## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> People will pick up on that. They will pick up on what feels like treachery. It will feel to them like a betrayal to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s legacy. 'Cause that's how it feels to me, right? We're all feeling it together. That's the point. And so we offer this as a course correction for them. You know, I want to believe that they're just grieving in a weird way, that they have a ton of things on their plates. Maybe they're fearful for their own lives. I don't know. But if that were the truth, they could still get the truth out to other people. And that is something I want you to know that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was remarkable at. And that's why I always say spend a Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Never took the bait on people saying, "He's this; he's this." Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was very good at knowing he's the guy they'll get in the room. He was happy to schmooze. He was a perfect diplomat and politician.
