## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Saddens me that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was stressed and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was worried, and that the very people that were stressing him out and making him have that sense of anxiety and worry then eulogized him and lied about all that. Why lie? That's the part that the public does not understand. How can we then trust a person that lies in that way? The natural thing is for us to then wonder what else is Josh lying about? Would we trust if Josh came out and said that tweet was definitely about Irina (Irina Zarutska)? Other people pull Donald Trump tweets. Some did pull that very tweet and called for a public execution. Would you trust Josh if he came out and said, "I know I didn't contextualize it, and I know all day I was tweeting about Israel, but that one was about Irina (Irina Zarutska)."
