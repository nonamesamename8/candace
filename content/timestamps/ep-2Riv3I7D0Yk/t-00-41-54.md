## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Again, that's JustThriveHealth.com, promo code Candace at checkout. Okay, first I want to put out—and I think cops call—an APB. What does that actually stand for, Mark? All points bulletin. See, you're never too old to learn something. And of course, Mark knew that instantly. All points bulletin. Mark has got a lot of random facts about every subject up there in his brain. We're not really sure why. First order of business: I gotta put out this all-points bulletin. I'm looking for footage on UVU campus—some particular footage from people that were there that day—and I want to be real specific here so we don't clog up the inbox. Obviously when you send footage to bigger files—I'm looking for video footage of any older males.
