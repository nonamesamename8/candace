## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I just don't hear him calling for the death penalty in those days that we're leading up. So I decided to do what I always do rather than say what he definitely meant or what he didn't mean. I decided to just create a micro timeline of Josh Hammer's tweets. And it gets pretty interesting on September 9th, the day before Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. This is what Josh Hammer tweeted. He tweeted a total of nine times on September 9th, and you can gather what was going on that day from his tweets. He wakes up at 7:30 a.m.—or rather pushes the first tweet at 7:30 a.m.—and he tweets about a viral Phillies crowd scandal. This is in Eastern Standard Time, by the way.
