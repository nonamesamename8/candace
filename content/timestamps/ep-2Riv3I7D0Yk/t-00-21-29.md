## Transcript

**Josh Hammer:**
> "We actually did speak for the last time less than 24 hours before the assassination happened. We had a Zoom call: a friend of mine, him, a couple of his producers. It was a small call. We were literally talking, above all, about the anti-Israel questions that he expected to receive on this campus tour. And we were kind of talking him through talking points and strategy and how to deal with these expected hostile questions. And you held on my book, Israel and Civilization, Ali. The last words I think Charlie (Charlie Kirk) spoke to me were— he literally said, 'You know, Josh, you know, when the Israel question comes up, I'm just going to plug your book, you know, Israel and Civilization, because I think that what you write in the book basically is how I feel as well.'" And that ends up being the last time that we spoke.
