## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That has been almost the only compelling argument that Israel had anything to do with it: is the way they're acting right now. Like Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu, the propaganda, the lies, the coming after Candace (Candace Owens). None of this was necessary. Nobody thought, when this first happened, "This is 100% Israel." 100%, it's happened in Mormon country. How come there were no Mormon people, no Mormon presidents coming out and saying, "I just want to be clear that we didn't kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk)" 24 hours after he died? 'Cause that's what Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) did. How come there were no Mormon people that started Operation Mormon Pastor or President, feeling the need to baselessly attack me? I was actually on the Mormons.
