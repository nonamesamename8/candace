## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's such a sweet comment. Jose Cruz writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), I love you so much. May God bless you. Can you lightly? Please don't stop. A lot of love from Mexico." "I'm not associated with Turning Point USA, and I'm not a liberal. Please don't tear apart Turning Point USA because we need a movement for the youth. Please tread lightly. Make sure you have all the facts because you are an important voice." Any youth movement must be based in truth. And like I said, Turning Point USA has fantastic people that worked and signed up to work for that company and dedicated their time with that company—whether even volunteers, people on college campuses—because they believed in truth, and they knew they were getting it from Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Right now, we're at a point.
