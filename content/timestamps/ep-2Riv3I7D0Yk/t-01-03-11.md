## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Well, there is good news because they've now created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment. It'll give you peace of mind. The loan will allow you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing loan mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started with no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now. Call 800-795-1210—that's 800-795-1210—or visit AmericanFinancing.net slash Owens.
