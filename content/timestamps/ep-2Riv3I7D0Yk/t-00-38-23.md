## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Black Angus beef, famous for its great flavor. Riverbend Ranch has taken the Black Angus beef to a whole new level. Over the last 35 years, the ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 Western U.S. ranches. Those partnership ranches receive a substantial premium from Riverbend Ranch for raising those calves without the use of growth hormones and without antibiotics, and every fall the calves containing these all-genetics were turned to Riverbend Ranch to spend the following summer in lush mountain pastures.
