## Transcript

**SPEAKER_3:**
> "Precisely, as you as you mentioned, there have been people who like Ian Carroll, and it pains me just to mention her name—Candace (Candace Owens)—because I know how close she was and maybe still is to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—um, but at the end of the day she's chosen to hijack his death right now to blame it on Israel. I mean, it's just so disturbing. Um, but then you have the people who are sort of a bit more in the middle— maybe I wouldn't even say it in the middle, but they're teetering a bit: the Megyns and Kellys and the Michael Knowleses and others, kind of in this in-between."
