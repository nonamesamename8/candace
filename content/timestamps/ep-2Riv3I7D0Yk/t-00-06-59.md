## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This is—we are in central time—so that's about 9:05 p.m. Eastern time. Now what is the justification for this? There might be one. I tried in earnest to at first rationalize it, right? What could have been going on that Josh Hammer decided to dig through the 2013 Twitter archives and retweet someone calling for a public execution? Well, I'll let one of the many Zionist PR agents explain it first. Yashar Ali, who, like I said, is quite literally paid to do PR for Zionists. I know this personally, on the right and on the left, tried to explain it away by kind of lying, I would say.
