## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So he drives off base, just a little ways off base to get some coffee and Sierra Vista. while getting that coffee, he runs into some soldiers, again, this is just all God at this point, who happened to be wearing 10th Mountain Division patches. And he's like, that's my old unit. What's going on here? Like that, he thinks his unit's gone. Nothing's going on with this unit for a long time that it's been torn apart. Or I don't know what the military expression is for that. He strikes up a conversation with these young guys and they tell him, oh, no, no, no, the old Joint Task Force Six is now being continued and it's known as JTF, Joint Task Force Southern Border.
