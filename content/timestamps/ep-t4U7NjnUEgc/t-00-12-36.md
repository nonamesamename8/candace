## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We avoided being taken hostage or shot, sticking away and driving out of that little town. I was taken back to Fort Huachuca with the U.S. Border Patrol agent. I was with believing, since I was just a young 20-year-old, that I must have somehow compromised my own ID. The next day, I had a debrief with the Army Criminal Investigation Division and a prosecutor from Tucson, Arizona, informing me of how my ID became compromised.
