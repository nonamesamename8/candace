## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I think Charlie, whatever vision he had in which he knew his life would be short and which he knew that I would not let this go because I somehow feel tied to it and we're seeing more and more every day. That's not how I am tied to this. I think that this is God operating. I really do. I think bless this man. Thank you so much for your service to this country. I expect I know that he wants to, he said he would love to meet Ian Carroll (Ian Carroll) and I guess he's watching his stuff and I will obviously make that happen and much more in the coming days. I don't expect the feds to reach out. I don't expect them to be interested in this angle or this potential meeting that I think they probably already knew about.
