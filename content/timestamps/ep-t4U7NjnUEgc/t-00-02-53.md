## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I kid you not when I say that it was the very first email that I saw, the very first email that I opened up. and it really didn't have any details. It was a young woman and she said, you really should call my friend. It is absolutely urgent and he has information that you need to hear. And don't tell me why, I don't know what came over me, but maybe it was this intentional prayer. I said, I'm just gonna call him right now.
