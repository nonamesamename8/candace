## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> your type right there is like a person who's having financial issues and yet decides to go out and put a hundred can of poker game. And when he loses and is a further 100 K in the hole comes back home and beats his wife and kids and thinks he's a tough guy. That's how you're acting right now. I'm not your wife, I'm not your kids. Get your affairs in order and stop blaming me because I'm actually traversing down the path that hasn't been traveled by standing up and saying that something corrupt happened and Charlie Kirk was assassinated. And I don't care about your midterms, okay? I don't care about your next year midterms and whether or not the Republican party is united, okay? Because I don't want to stand next to people that would cover up Charlie Kirk's assassination.
