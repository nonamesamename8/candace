## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It is now around 7.37 a.m. when he enters the new or temporary JTF headquarters and he sees two guys and he's pretty impressed. He's like, whoa, these are again military term E4, E5s. He told me that means that there are lieutenant colonels. and they are the ones that are checking him in, he happens to write in a walk in at the exact time that they are concluding a meeting and he is kind of even more impressed because he sees about 12 lieutenant colonels.
