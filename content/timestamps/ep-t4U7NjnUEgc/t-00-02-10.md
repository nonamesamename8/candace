## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We all know that nothing that we have been presented with makes any practical sense. but there are sort of smoking guns in this that are missing, right? It's one thing to point out all the lies, but we need to also have solid concrete proof of something that took place that was out of the ordinary in the days leading up, maybe, I don't know, a planning session. Well, I got back home after this very intentional prayer and did my routine, had a very late dinner, I went up and said goodnight to the kids, got myself ready for bed, sat in bed, and I thought, you know what, I'm just going to open the tips box.
