## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I do hope, though, that somebody else saw something and somebody knows the quickest way to FOIA requests that stuff. Somebody knows how to get behind this so we can get information. I've given you the dates. I've given you the times. He has given so much more. I just thank God that I saw that email. We're going to pause there. And if you guys know anything, obviously, email us at more tips at CandiceOwens.com and we'll get through some sponsors that we are grateful for. All right, you guys, this holiday season, you can express your love with a very special gift of premium steaks from Riverbend Ranch. Their holiday bundles are only available while supplies last, and they're going to go very quickly.
