## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, so they were trafficking from Poland through to Mexico weapons and other drugs, but then they found God. Unemployment. I don't know what to make of that. Who am I to question somebody saying that they found God, but Arizona is quite a place and I worry about what happened. And, you know, when you get to a certain level in business, they offer you what they say. What is the expression? It's either the silver or the lead. You take the money or you take the bullet. And I wonder if that was presented to Charlie. I wonder if that's why he was fearful the day before when he messaged people and said, they are going to kill me. Who was he referring to?
