## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You can order your holiday gifts today at riverbendranch.com. If you haven't yet tried Riverbend Ranch steaks, it is time that you did, because I've never had a better steak in my entire life. For the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound technology to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. They only use the top one or two percent of the entire Angus population as their breeding stock, producing beef that has much more flavor and tenderness than your average Angus beef. Each steak is aged to perfection for 21 days. All Riverbend Ranch cattle were born and raised right here in the USA. They never use growth hormones or antibiotics. And the beef is processed right at their ranch in their award-winning USDA-inspected processing facility.
