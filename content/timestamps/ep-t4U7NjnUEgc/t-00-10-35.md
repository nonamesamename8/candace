## Transcript

**News Anchor:**
> Federal agents said the tunnel cost at least a million dollars to build and had probably been in operation for six months to a year. Last November, customs agents received a tip that a sophisticated tunnel was being used to funnel cocaine into the United States. This type of tunnel is not an amateur operation. It's a highly sophisticated engineering feat that took place. Mexican authorities were also involved in the investigation and the raid. Earlier this month, police seized 2,000 pounds of cocaine, which they said came into the U.S. through the tunnel. The drugs were headed for Southern California.
