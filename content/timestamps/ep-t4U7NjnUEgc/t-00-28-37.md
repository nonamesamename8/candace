## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I could have just put up documents upon documents certifying that he was there, certifying that this happened. whether or not his descriptions and whether or not the people that he thinks he saw, he actually saw at this base, I don't know. What I will say is that something that I could easily have done was to see whether or not I asked him, you know, did you see Dan Flood (Dan Flood)? No, well, that checks out because Dan Flood (Dan Flood) was with Charlie in Korea. And I am wondering about that. Why would you want to go to Japan a day before you have a college campus event, right? You have Charlie on the 5th and on the 6th of September. He is in Korea doing an event.
