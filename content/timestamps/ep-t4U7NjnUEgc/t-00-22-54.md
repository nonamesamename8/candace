## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They then attempted to try to gaslight me to see if they could angle an accusation of me being a threat to others or myself. When all that fell flat, they then conferenced with base commander. After I assumed they verified that I was not there to spy on that particular meeting, they decided it was OK to send me off post. That's when I drove a Tucson. I got a room. The next morning I turned in my rental car. I got on a plane back home and I had to stop in Salt Lake. Upon landing and turning on the phone, my wife is telling me about Charlie Kirk. And again, this was just a coincidence. I happened to be in the airport at the time that you are talking about all of those strange flights that were taking place there.
