## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And all of a sudden after Brian, who he believes to be Brian Harpole (Brian Harpole), who he's not obviously recognized at that time. He would not have known that was Brian Harpole (Brian Harpole), but he remembers him obviously because then the biggest political assassination since JFK happens. Suddenly somebody hits the panic button and two captains come out and they escort him out of the building and they begin what becomes a seven-hour interrogation, okay? They think he's a spy. How did you rumble this meeting? How did you know this meeting was taking place? He's getting asked a bunch of questions. They're putting pressure on him. They're gaslighting him.
