## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> She does really great work. And I keep wrongly branding her laughing as a Catholic in a couple weeks. So she's like, I'm not Catholic. I'm like, I am so sorry. I don't know why I thought she was Catholic. I made that up. Hopefully she will be sued. OK, that's what I will say to that. And she's doing a really great job, particularly focusing on that faith angle, because I do believe that the faith was the infiltration at turning point USA. And it is, by the way, a fact that in recent in the last year, they even hired former cartel weapons traffickers at Turning Point USA who found God.
