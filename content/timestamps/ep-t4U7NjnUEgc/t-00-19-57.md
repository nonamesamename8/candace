## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He tells me, you do not see that many people, that many E4s, E5s, E6s, please military guys forgive me for me not knowing what the proper vernacular But he just goes, what's going on? He's like, you don't see this unless you're at the Pentagon or you're at the White House. You just don't see this many high up the food chain, Lieutenant Colonels. He's going, man, this is like, this is a pretty important meeting. And then he sees three men walk out, one of which is the person he identifies as the person that's the center of the action, right? He said, you could just tell this is the most important person. Um, and he has gray hair. He's got glasses. I believe he said that he's about five, 10.
