## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys, happy Tuesday. Where to begin? Well, in the final days leading up to Charlie Kirk's assassination, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was pretty busy, right? He went on a first time trip to Asia, quite a quick trip, quite at least a quick turnaround to go first to Korea for a couple of days and then off to Japan. And honestly, If I was a conspiracy theorist and I kind of am one, I might think at this stage that the timing of that trip might have been intentional because something was going on back home that they didn't want him to see. Well, what I'm about to tell you guys today is going to positively blow your mind.
