## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And now, thanks to a generous match program, your gift can be doubled as well. That means twice as many ultrasounds, twice as many lives being saved, and twice as many mothers that are given hope. They're also provided diapers, car seats, counseling, and care for up to two years. If you've heard about Preborn before and you've not yet taken action, there is no better time than right now. Their work is some of the most important work to help heal our country. One ultrasound is just $28, but you can give 10 times that amount if you are able to. Head to preborn.com slash Candace to give. Again, that's preborn.com slash Candace. Okay, thank you guys who are correcting me in the chat. I'm obviously very new to military terms.
