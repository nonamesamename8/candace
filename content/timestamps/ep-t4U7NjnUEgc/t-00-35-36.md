## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And obviously yesterday we spoke about this Pierre in Scottsdale and I had mentioned that he had a partner, Pierre Falcone (Pierre Falcone) had a partner named Arkady Gaidemach (Arkady Gaidemach). Didn't expect that to be relevant to anything, but they were both involved in Angola Gate, which was global trafficking at the highest levels of government. But this Arkady Gaidemach (Arkady Gaidemach) didn't show up for his court hearing. and he just was sentenced in absence for trafficking weapons, et cetera, et cetera. I explained to you that he was born in Russia and then when Israel became a nation, he was first over there.
