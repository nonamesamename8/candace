## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So you hear the directive from the then president, H.W. Now, our protagonist in the story is Harry (Harry Myers), right? 20 years old and he's at the bottom of the military totem pole. And he gets attached to this new command, this new Southern command. Previously, there had never been that joint task force. And specifically, he was a part of operation that came to be known as Operation Catacomb. He describes himself, and I'm going to put this in quotations, as a lowly military censor guy assigned to this joint task operation six, and they were to cover half of Arizona and Mexico. And I'm going to read this next portion of his story directly from him, okay?
