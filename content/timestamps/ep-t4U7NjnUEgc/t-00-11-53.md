## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Somehow, in the immediate days after the bust, prior to the United States side getting the photos from the Mexican authorities, my information was given to the cartels. In continuing the mission, me and one Border Patrol agent were sent to Naco, Arizona, where I was approached by a cartel member confirming my identification by rattling off my mother's name, address, my high school, my friends, everything listed in my clearance packet, which was supposed to be locked in custody, in the custody of the Joint Task Force Six commander. whose picture was with El Chapo (El Chapo) and about to be discovered.
