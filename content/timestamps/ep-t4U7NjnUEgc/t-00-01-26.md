## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It was the feast of the Immaculate Conception. A day of obligation means that a day in which you are required to attend mass outside of obviously typically Sundays. And so as soon as we concluded this podcast, grabbed my jacket and I ran out the door, okay? And as I was sitting through mass deciding, I guess what was on my mind to pray about for whatever reason got on my knees and I was not expecting this to come out, but I just focused my prayer on wanting Something to be delivered to me a piece of evidence that would help us put together the full picture of this assassination. Obviously, we all know that what we are being told is not true.
