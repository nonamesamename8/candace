## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Maybe we should be looking below if there is this interest in pipelines. And I saw that actually where he was sitting, there's a whole irrigation system that's managed by the university. And so there's definitively stuff beneath Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Again, I don't know anything about ballistics, but I've been very clear that we will be exploring every lead until we get a proper answer for what happened. And I think that that would probably be an interesting one for the feds to explore, because within 48 hours—I mean, was it 48 hours, Skyler?— they decided to instead pave that area—repave it. Do we have footage of that? Here we go. Yeah, no, they kind of did the opposite here.
