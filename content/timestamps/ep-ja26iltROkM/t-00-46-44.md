## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And here's what I love the most, not only do the products deliver results, but Neme is proudly American made. Every formula is crafted right here in the USA, rivaling the best Korean skincare brands in quality, while staying true to our values of faith, family, and freedom. Right now Neme is giving my listeners 15% off your order. If you use the code Candice15 at checkout, but this offer ends soon. So do not wait to go to NemeSkincare.com today. Stock up on the three-step anti-aging routine and see the results for yourself. Support a brand that shares our values and take care of your skin at the same time. Visit NemeSkincare.com and use code Candice15. Also, remind you guys about American financing because the cost of everything is still out of control. Many of us are relying on credit cards to cover essentials. If that debt is piling up, then you are not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt.
