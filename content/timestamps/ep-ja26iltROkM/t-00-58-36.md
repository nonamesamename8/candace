I mean, Erika Kirk was raised in a Catholic family, so that was a strange thing to have people react so crazy. I don't lie because I always know that eventually daylight comes in, and things get exposed. And so I'm excited to hear her speak about the pressure that he was under—as was alluded to by Alex Clark—to speak about whether or not he was offered more money—whether he lost money, which he did.
