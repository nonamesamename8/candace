## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> "You're not anti-Israel. You don't wish them harm. You're not, you know, like cheering on Iran." "No, I support it. I think they're our allies. I want them—" "But you would be called an anti-Semite by some people for saying this." "And I think that's ridiculous." "I don't hate Jews because I think a nation should defend themselves." "Exactly." "I think that's the most ridiculous thing ever. I feel like it's becoming like the word racism. Like, we just disagree with them, so we just have to call them a name. I don't think they're actually anti-Semitic. I think people just can't agree with them, and they can't prove them wrong. So they just throw a word out and be like, 'You're anti-Semitic because you think that we should stop sending our money there.'" "Something that I see amongst the people around, I do see more like general disdain towards—I mean, just being honest—Jewish people." "That's correct."
