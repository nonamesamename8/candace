## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I don't want to be playing defense. I don't want to water down what I believe in to be palatable. Not that I've ever been accused of doing that. But it is true that silence is not kindness. Silence is consent. And right now, the greatest silence that is being had right now is around the lives that are ended before they even take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we should act like it. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love. For just $28, you can provide a free ultrasound to a woman that is in a crisis and considering an abortion. $28 will help her see the life inside of her, to give her the truth that we know that our current culture will not. So don't sit this out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. Be unapologetically pro-life.
