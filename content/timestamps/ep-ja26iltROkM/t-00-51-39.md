## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, they definitively have lost the most because clearly people did not buy Benjamin Netanyahu's BS. And the fact that people immediately thought that—and I wasn't the person who said this—but immediately thought that Israel was suspicious really shows you that they have lost all goodwill with the American people. And that's—again—because of what they're doing: their actions in Gaza. So I would agree with you that they've lost a lot since losing Charlie (Charlie Kirk), because he was kind of the last person who said, "I am pro-Israel." And he actually was somebody who had a presence across all of these universities.
