## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> She is referring to the children who witnessed the assassination of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) and spoke out about that on the news the next morning on Good Morning America. "Also, the children that spoke yesterday sounded highly rehearsed on their quote-unquote experience." Okay, so to the first portion: I can tell you that I know Jack Posobiec. He has always been very solid with me. I mean, always. And Jack Posobiec—by the way—every single time that I have been attacked publicly, particularly over the declaration that Christ is King, it's like a trigger for Jack Posobiec. He goes hard in the paint. If you say you can't say "Christ is King," Jack Posobiec wants to go to war immediately—him and his brother. And that's great. So he's like a crusader.
