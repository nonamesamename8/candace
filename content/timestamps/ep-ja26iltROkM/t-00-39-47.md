## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I actually think there's probably like 20 representatives between Senate and the House who I think are actually fully doing the work of the American people and don't have the interests of some group pulling their sway. But when you hear that lots of other countries also are lobbying, do you think, I mean, that you probably don't know the names of those countries, but it's happening. Does that upset you equally or is APEC just get all the press because it's so top of mind? If those other ones are doing the same thing, of course, I do not think that other countries should be telling us how to spend, you know, the telling our representatives and people who are here to represent all of us that they should be focusing outside of the United States. America first.
