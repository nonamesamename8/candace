## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Please help make, please help this make sense. Grateful for you, Candice. Keep up the great work. Brie again, that's from last week. Nobody knows, but I would like to see the tunnel network. Hey, I don't know how you do that. There's probably some radar you can buy to see where the tunnels are. You're just a student on the campus. If it's legal, obviously, I have no idea if it's legal. Do not do anything illegal. I don't know if you can just buy all I know is that the laser stuff that I use to see if there's a stud in the wall and that's perfectly legal.
