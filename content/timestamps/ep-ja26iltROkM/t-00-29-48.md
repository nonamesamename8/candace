## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The goal, of course, was to prove that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Candace (Candace Owens) had a falling out. Look at this message. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) talking trash about Candace (Candace Owens)—except he's not at all. Instead, what the message did is that it proved exactly what I was saying: that donors and Zionists were attempting to control his speech, my speech, and who he platformed. So these are the text messages that he shared. And he wrote: "Exclusive: a close friend of Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) shared these messages." I'm going to guess it's either Seth Dillon or Josh Hammer. Could not be, but I'm just putting that out there because of the style of the messages. And he says he was never wavering on Israel, and they are active— he was actively pushing back on Candace Owens's (Candace Owens's) false narrative. Now, these are the messages he shared. (Text messages)
