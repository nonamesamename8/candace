## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I fear the same thing happens with all the talk of race. The more we talk about it, the more we bring it up, the more racism actually happens. This is like, I try to tell. Thank you for saying this. Because like this is I'm trying to tell these people and they're like we must get more aggressive and so like let me ask a question if we were to say if we were to remove like if people said what Tucker said is anti-semitic I don't hold that view but it's like a lot of people on Twitter are like calling us out and like whatever that's not gonna happen But if we were to cancel Tucker, would anti-Semitism increase or decrease? I think increase because that means any supporter of Tucker Carlson's statement therefore makes them anti-Semites.
