I have no regrets. I was happy to be canceled from anything to say what I felt in my heart to be true. And that is also the lesson of the story of Christ. You know, you have to tell the truth. You have to accept the punishment. And Christ will get you through it. And Christ got my family through last year, there's no question. Hurricane, Ian writes, oh, hurricane, but spelled hurrican.
