## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Many of us are relying on credit cards to cover essentials. If that debt is piling up, then you are not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing, but maybe hesitated to do so because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. There's good news. They've created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC—which can have varied interest rates—the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment, giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes a 10-minute phone call to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing and start saving now.
