## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So, yeah, daylight is always the best disinfected. Anyways, you guys, thank you for all the support. We're going to have an incredible week. More stuff to reveal to you if you want to. Support the show. If you want to go to prison, you can go to CandiceOwens.com and buy a CIA parody shirt, because you're going with me. I'm not going alone. I'll do it. I'll do hood rat stuff. I want to do it with my friends. So if you buy it, then I'm going to report you to Laura Loomer, who will report you to the CIA. And I'll see you guys in prison tomorrow.
