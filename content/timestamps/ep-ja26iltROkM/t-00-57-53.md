## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I don't lie about anything, so I'm happy she's going to speak about the rumors that Benjamin Netanyahu offered him a boatload of money. I didn't say 150 million was offered because I don't know the exact amount Benjamin Netanyahu offered him. I said 150 million dollars I was told Benjamin Netanyahu gave for Operation Mockingpastor. Remember when all the pastors one weekend got up on stage and were like, "Tucker Carlson (Tucker Carlson) and Candace Owens (Candace Owens)?" That is what I was told. That was 150 million dollars went into that. But I definitively made the statement that Benjamin Netanyahu offered Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) a boatload of money, and he rejected it. So she will respond to that. I said that Catholics were excited—hopeful about Charlie (Charlie Kirk).
