## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Do you guys think that's like not the best way to approach this. Raise your hand. OK. I think Ted Cruz is Genesis 12 3. I think a lot of people see those off putting when you look at the new test. Why. Because I think a lot of people, they look especially at the writings of Paul, where he talks about how the new flesh is not the same as the people in the Old Covenant. The new flesh is everybody, is everyone's included. You're talking about Romans 9? Yes, 9 and 6, yeah. Are you Catholic? Converting to Catholic from Judaism. Oh, from Judaism? Yes. Oh, wow. So you're ethnically Jewish. Ethnically Jewish, yes. And you have concerns about APEC. Yes, I do. I'm told that, by some people, that if I criticize APEC, I'm anti-Semitic. I think it's ridiculous. I feel like it's great to have a concern for your country.
