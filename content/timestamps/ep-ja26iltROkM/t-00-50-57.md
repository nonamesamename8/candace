## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I get that—what you're saying. I will say this: I would argue that in terms of the free markets, like, you go with your product: "You say, 'I'm pro-Israel. I'm running this business.'" They are losing—badly, badly. There's no question about that. Everyone can see it everywhere. And it's because of how they behave, right? The gaslighting, the threats, the intimidation. "We can control your life. We can call, and we'll create a firestorm so you won't be able to hit the stage at AmFest." People can see that, and they don't like that behavior. So when you do that—and then also say that you're the good guys— it doesn't ring true.
