## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I mentioned to his doctor that there were dozens of staff, students and special guests standing directly behind Charlie on the other side of the tent and he replied, it was an absolute miracle that someone else didn't get killed. His bone referring to Charlie was so healthy and the density was so, so impressive that he's like the man of steel. It should have just gone through and through. It likely would have killed those standing behind him too. In the end, the coroner did find the bullet just beneath the skin. Even in death, Charlie managed to save the lives of those around him. Remarkable and miraculous. End statement. Now, first I want to say this because people were attacking Andrew Colvett immediately.
