## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or visit AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. That's AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. Okay, some comments from Friday's episode that I didn't get to. I'm sorry about that. OU Chris writes: "Christ is King. May he guide you, be with you, and keep you safe." You know what? That message was even more appropriate now. Manuela Palacio writes: "Candace (Candace Owens), is Jack Posobiec trustworthy? I find it odd that a Navy intelligence officer—that the people closest to you betray you often for their own interests. It happened to Jesus—also the children that spoke yesterday."
