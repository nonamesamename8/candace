## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That's americanfinancing.net slash Owens. Okay, some comments from Friday's episode that I didn't get to. I'm sorry about that. OU Chris writes, Christ is King. May he guide you, be with you, and keep you safe. You know what? That message was even more appropriate now. Manuela Palacio writes, Candice, is Jack Posobiec trustworthy? I find it odd that a Navy intelligence officer, that the people closest to you betray you often for their own interests. It happened to Jesus, also the children that spoke yesterday. She is referring to the children who witnessed the assassination of Charlie Kirk and spoke out about that on the news the next morning on Good Mornings America.
