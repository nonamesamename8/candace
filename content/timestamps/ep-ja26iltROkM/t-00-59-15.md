## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I was told that individual was Bob Schulman—as I said last week—that took away millions of dollars from Turning Point, wanted his name taken off the building, and then changed his mind and did a 180 when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died. I mean, there was more than just him—obviously—but he was getting pressure from donors. I mean, I think he said it on a show. So, yeah—daylight is always the best disinfectant. Anyways, you guys—thank you for all the support. We're going to have an incredible week. More stuff to reveal to you. If you want to support the show, if you want to go to prison—you can go to CandaceOwens.com and buy a CIA parody shirt—because you're going with me. I'm not going alone. I'll do it. I'll do hood rat stuff. I want to do it with my friends. So if you buy it, then I'm going to report you to Laura Loomer—who will report you to the CIA.
