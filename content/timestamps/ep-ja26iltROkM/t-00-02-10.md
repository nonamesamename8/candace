## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I think that every single person should watch that speech. Truly, they should watch that speech. They should watch Tucker Carlson's (Tucker Carlson) speech. I don't think even showing you clips of it—I'm gonna show you one—could do it justice. You should watch it in its entirety. The emotion, the message of it.

He wanted to play it cool, so he's like, "Come meet her at Del Frisco's in New York City." And I came there, and she was just lovely. She was genuinely such a nice person. I was like, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk), just go for it." Just go for it. And he did go for it. And last night, I really do think that the entire world needed to hear her message.
