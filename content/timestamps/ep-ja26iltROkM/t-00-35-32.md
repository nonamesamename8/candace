## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I don't hate Jews because I think a nation should defend themselves. Exactly. I think that's the most ridiculous thing ever. I feel like it's becoming like the word racism. Like we just disagree with them, so we just have to call them a name. I don't think they're actually anti-Semitic. I think people just can't agree with them and they can't prove them wrong. So they just throw a word out and be like, you're anti-Semitic for because you think that we should stop sending our money there. Something that I see amongst the people around, I do see more like general disdain towards, I mean, just being honest, Jewish people. That's correct. Just because They're constantly being told that you hate Jews. And it's like, fine. If you're going to say I hate Jews over and over and over again, like if I'm going to be convicted of the crime, I might as well do the crime.
