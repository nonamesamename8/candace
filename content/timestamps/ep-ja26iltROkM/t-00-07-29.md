## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And when I was sharing what I saw, I was doing so because I was just thinking that, you know, this could help. Like, this can obviously remove people from their conspiracies. And then it kind of occurred to me that what I shared was a bigger deal than I had imagined—by saying that I didn't see any blood. And that is a fact. I did not see any blood. In fact, the only blood that I did see at all—I'm talking about blood on the back—was on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) hand, on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) left hand, which—as many people have been saying—means that the blood moved forward. We don't need to get into all of the gore.
