## Transcript

> She tweeted this. She's been attacking me nonstop. As part of her grift to monetize the murder of her quote unquote best friend, Charlie Kirk, Candice Owens is selling a CIA line of merchandise that is called the Candice Intelligence Agency, which rips off the CIA name and logo. It is a federal felony to use the CIA seal without license. She then cites the code and calls, reads it, sends a quote from it, rather pulls it, and then says, you are likely breaking the law with your CIA merch, Candace. The CIA can technically sue to get Candace to stop using their logo. It's really disrespectful to Charlie Kirk and the CIA.
