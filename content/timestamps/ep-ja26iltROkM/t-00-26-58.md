## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> She tweeted this. (Laura Loomer tweet) She's been attacking me nonstop. "As part of her grift to monetize the murder of her quote-unquote best friend, Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk), Candace Owens (Candace Owens) is selling a CIA line of merchandise that is called the Candace Intelligence Agency, which rips off the CIA name and logo. It is a federal felony to use the CIA seal without license." She then cites the code and reads it—sends a quote from it, rather—pulls it, and then says, "You are likely breaking the law with your CIA merch, Candace (Candace Owens). The CIA can technically sue to get Candace (Candace Owens) to stop using their logo. It's really disrespectful to Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) and the CIA."
