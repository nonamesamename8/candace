## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Christianity calls upon you to change. Our core prayer, given to us by Jesus, the Lord's Prayer, demands that we forgive other people, but proceeding that is a request for our forgiveness. In other words, forgive us our sins, meditate on what we've done wrong, how we've fallen short, and then it becomes possible to forgive other people. That is a call to change our hearts from Jesus, and that is the only way forward. Couldn't agree more. And I will say this, like, I am on this journey to figure out what happened on that day.
