## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And then she CCs and tags the Director of the CIA. Now, as everybody who watches this show knows, we've been selling that merch since before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) got assassinated. So we just continued our show with the merch that we already sold for our show. Obviously, our parody off of the CIA—which is perfectly legal, obviously—was related to the fact that we're always investigating things. So don't let the truth get in your way when you're smearing somebody. But the audacity to actually tag the Director of the CIA and ask us to go to prison or to get into trouble is just—I think it really highlights: they're insane.
