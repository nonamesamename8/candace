## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Because if we aren't accepting the narrative that that particular gun at that distance didn't pass through, and yet for whatever reason the feds scrambled to repave that area—maybe, as some people have speculated, he was shot from a closer distance— I started wondering: was there an access point to any valves? Were there any pipelines that could have been under Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? And as it turns out, I looked at some old pictures of where he was sitting, and there was a massive pipeline that was almost exactly behind where Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was sitting. Here's that. Maybe it's a water pipeline. I don't know, but there it is under the flag.

## Claims Made

- [factual] there was a massive pipeline that was almost exactly behind where Charlie was sitting
  - *Follow-up:* Site maps or old photos of UVU event area
