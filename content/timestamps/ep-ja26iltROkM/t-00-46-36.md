## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> This routine restores your skin barrier. It boosts collagen production, it reduces fine lines and wrinkles, it locks in moisture, and brightens for a healthy glow. And here's what I love the most: not only do the products deliver results, but Neemee is proudly American made. Every formula is crafted right here in the USA, rivaling the best Korean skincare brands in quality, while staying true to our values of faith, family, and freedom. Right now Neemee is giving my listeners 15% off your order if you use the code Candice15 at checkout, but this offer ends soon. So do not wait to go to NeemeeSkincare.com today. Stock up on the three-step anti-aging routine and see the results for yourself. Support a brand that shares our values and take care of your skin at the same time. Visit NeemeeSkincare.com and use code Candice15. Also, remind you guys about American Financing, because the cost of everything is still out of control.
