## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And, you know, don't let the facts get in the way of this bizarre narrative that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I had some falling out last year—which never happened. Rather, what happened was Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was peer-pressured by these same individuals for me not to speak at AmFest, and I was just like, "Dude, I don't even care"—which is what I told you. Now, in terms of his statement there that Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) viewpoints were not changing at all—these are not words that I put in Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) mouth. You can just go back and watch the things that he was saying. He hosted a sit-down—which was incredible, actually—to discuss what anti-Semitism is and what anti-Semitism is not. It was a town hall of sorts with students. Gen Z—as Megyn Kelly (Megyn Kelly) said—you can't find anybody beneath the age of 30 that supports Israel. That's a fact.
