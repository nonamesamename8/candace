## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I wanna be clear: I didn't think that that episode was going to have the reaction that it did, but I am grateful. We were unpacking the footage that was going viral of the guy that was taking down the camera—which was directly behind Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) head—a mere four minutes after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot. Everybody thought that it was very suspicious. I recognized the individual and reached out, had a conversation, saw the footage, and made the promise that I was not going to share it—although I said to you, I encouraged them to share it. I believe that the reason everybody is a conspiracy theorist is because people don't share truth, right? Once you share everything, there's no room for conspiracy.
