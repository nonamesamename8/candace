## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Yes, we did this left and right—you know—forcing the FBI's hand and saying, "Okay, maybe these messages didn't happen." Marzi continues: "Netanyahu is using Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) death to distract us from the ongoing genocide in Gaza." I would say if that was his plan, it ain't working. This person writes: "The internet is back in Palestine, and people are speaking out." Yep. And I have been somebody that has spoken out, and it came at great risk. And I am very happy that I did. I have no regrets. I was happy to be canceled from anything to say what I felt in my heart to be true. And that is also the lesson of the story of Christ. You know—you have to tell the truth. You have to accept the punishment. And Christ will get you through it.
