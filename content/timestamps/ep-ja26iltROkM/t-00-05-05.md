## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> In fact, I'm now currently working on a minute-by-minute timeline, which I will have for you guys later this week of what exactly happened in the seconds and minutes following Charlie. getting shot. I need to know. I need to follow bodies. I've already been able to, as I asked over the weekend, locate George Zinn in the crowd. It seems a bit suspicious to me how far he was and then suddenly they take him through a pathway. I mean, that's him right there. Thank you to the person that sent this picture. But then I find him on video and I'm trying to understand how he made it down the pathway and was taken through to the same area that they had just taken Charlie in the car.
