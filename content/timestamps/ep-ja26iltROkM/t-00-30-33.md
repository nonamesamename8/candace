## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This is the friend of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in blue. He writes: "I watched the podcasts. Candace (Candace Owens) needs to say two things, and this will stop in its tracks. They are fundamental conservative principles. And she didn't say either: quote, 'Israel is not committing a genocide.' Second quote: '30 dead, raped, kidnapped, and beheaded Americans in Gaza makes the fight in Gaza America First.' And then he ends it by saying: 'This is not Ukraine.'" He's literally saying what I have to say to make something stop in its tracks, right? And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) writes: "This is right. I'm really trying to help her." What else is he going to say to this person?
