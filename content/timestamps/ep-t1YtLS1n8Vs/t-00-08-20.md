## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So currently you have Trump people who I guess are trying to save face for their remarkable lack of curiosity as it pertains to who assassinated Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who loved them and worked very hard, did whatever he could to support their administration. They're trying to save face, pretend that they're upset, you know? Like, “Oh, we're gonna do something.” “It's not okay that this happened.” “Look over here, right?” “Oh, look over here.” The ADL put Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on a list. Now that he's dead, we demand post justice. And Kash Patel is doing that. He's acting right now. He's pretending that he's delivering some form of justice. I think Elon Musk tweeted about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and TPUSA being on the list, and then it kind of caught fire. And this became the new conservative talking point.
