## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I gotta say when I saw that I was actually kind of giddy because I was like, “Finally, it looks like a college student from UVU who is speaking to the news.” That's great. And of course, I then had to wonder what she was studying. And it turns out no, she doesn't go to UVU. I don't know if they just—a lot of these people were not available that day. But what she does for a living is quite interesting because there's an emerging pattern, and for whatever reason nobody who spoke to the press said what their connections were. It turns out that she works for the Orem Police Department. She's a records specialist. And I should tell you guys, kind of unbelievably, in August—first you're gonna believe this—they kind of lost a lot of people that were working at the department.
