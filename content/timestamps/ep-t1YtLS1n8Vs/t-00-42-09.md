## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Again, that's 800-795-1210. Or you can visit AmericanFinancing.net/Owens, AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. All right, you guys, comment that I wanna read from YouTube yesterday. It made me so happy. I also shared it on my Instagram, a little encouragement regarding homeschooling, because that is what I am pushing for. This user wrote, “My sister took her four-year-old out of school yesterday. Literally started homeschooling this morning. I cannot go into detail, but I'll say this. Financially, they will be tight, but she said that it is worth it. Since I saw her conviction, I volunteered myself to be his PE and music teacher as his extracurricular activities. Like they say, it takes a village.” Indeed, I love that. I also want you to network with moms in the area because like what you're saying, I can do PE. That's what me and another mom did.
