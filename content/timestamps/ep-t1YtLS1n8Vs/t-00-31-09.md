## Transcript

**Clayton Morris / Elizabeth Lane:**

No matter what happens, they will take the side of the state.” I did not listen to him. And I ended up calling one of the biggest firms in Utah, just to ask for advice.

Why are you so rude on the phone?” So then I said, “Listen, there is a lawyer who's qualified, and he's actually very famous in New York, wants to represent this kid. All I need is a consent from Tyler Robinson to do so.” “And we think that you can help to this.”
