## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> We can pull back up Emmanuel; you saw his name there. Again, we're pulling people that spoke to the press publicly; we're not revealing any information here, but he works for Domo Incorporated. His history is that he is a software engineer, a technical advisor. His name is German in origin. I'd like to know a little bit more. Also, when I look up these people, by the way, none of them have reached out to me. Like from the minute that this all happened, I asked for information. And for whatever reason, these people were very anxious to speak to the press right after, but then were like, “You know what, we're not gonna speak to anybody else about that.” Same for Grinnell owner; we covered this. He was with Phil Lyman's uncle, cousin—I mean nephew, cousin.
