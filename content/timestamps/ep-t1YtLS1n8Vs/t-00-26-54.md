## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You can ask Comet to do things for you, and it literally clicks, types, searches, scrolls for you. What I love most about Comet is that it can take weeknight chaos and turn it into simple, stress-free dinners with just a few taps. I get personalized meal plans based on my family's preferences. Comet orders the groceries for me, and it gets them delivered right to the door. Comet can shop for you, make reservations, book travel, summarize articles or videos, send emails, schedule meetings, and a lot more. It just makes your life easier. So go and take back your time online; download Perplexity's new web browser, Comet, and let it work for you, not the other way around. Check it out at pplx.ai/Candace (Candace Owens). Again, that's pplx.ai/Candace (Candace Owens).
