## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You can ask Comet to do things for you, and it literally clicks, types, searches, scrolls for you. What I love most about Comet is that it can take weeknight chaos and turn it into simple, stress-free dinners with just a few taps. I get personalized meal plans based on my family's preferences. Comet orders the groceries for me, and it gets them delivered right to the door. Comet can shop for you, make reservations, book travel, summarize articles or videos, send emails, schedule meetings, and a lot more. It just makes your life easier. So go and take back your time online; download Perplexity's new web browser, Comet, and let it work for you, not the other way around. Check it out at pplx.ai/Candace (Candace Owens). Again, that's pplx.ai/Candace (Candace Owens).

  > "Also, when I look up these people, by the way, none of them have reached out to me. Like from the minute that this all happened, I asked for information. And for whatever reason, these people were very anxious to speak to the press right after, but then were like, You know what, we're not gonna speak to anybody else about that. Same for Grinnell owner; we covered this. He was with Phil Lyman's uncle, cousin—I mean nephew, cousin. He, we learned, was a software engineer from Austria. So Austria, Germany, okay."
