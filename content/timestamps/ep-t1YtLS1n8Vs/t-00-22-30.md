## Transcript

**Eyewitnesses:**
> So I took a knee, you know, just out of habit from being in the Marine Corps, and people were still screaming and running. And I just decided to look for the shooter wherever they might be. But people just kept clearing out.

I just saw and I heard, and we all crashed down, and I wish there was a better security. I was a little surprised when I walked into the courtyard and there wasn't any metal detector. There were securities around the building, but it wasn't really solid.
