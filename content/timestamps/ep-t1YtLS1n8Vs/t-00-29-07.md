## Transcript

**SPEAKER_5:**
> Investigative journalist Elizabeth Lane is not giving up on this story. She's been on the ground in Utah connecting the CIA dots, the three-letter agency dots and connections, and she joins us now. Elizabeth, great to have you on the show. Thank you for having me, Clayton. I looked at Tyler Robinson's case, and I thought, “Well, why don't I get this guy a lawyer? Because that at least puts me near him so I can understand and control the process.” And this is times where they couldn't find the guy a lawyer, and they were kind of scrambling around to figure out who was going to be his lawyer. And I started approaching different firms in Utah, trying to get him a lawyer for pro bono.
