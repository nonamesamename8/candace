## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Well, Marjorie Taylor Greene has been very loud about how she is against that as she has grown increasingly vocal. And she feels the need, as she did a couple of days ago, to publicly clarify that she is not suicidal. She wrote, “I am not suicidal, and I'm one of the happiest and healthiest people that you will meet. I have full faith in God, and Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior. As a sinner, I am only saved through His grace and mercy. With that said, if something happens to me, I ask you all to find out which foreign government or powerful people would take heinous actions to stop the information from coming out not only about this issue, but because of the truth that I have been speaking. The people understand what I am saying.”
