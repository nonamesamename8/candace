## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anyways, the name that we had received was; it turned out, somebody that actually provided the only eyewitness testimony of having seen the shooter up close, limping. So it's possible, just to run the other side of things, that this woman captured both of them walking back-to-back and she just was walking near him and she had nothing to do with helping him change. That's all possible, and you should consider that possibility. We don't have answers. But there's something else that's interesting about her. Like I said, the testimony that she provided is interesting, and she is the only person that saw the shooter limping up close. And her name, and we know this because she spoke to the news—they all did—is Olivia Robertson Cobb Bishop. Let's listen to her testimony now. [CLIP ATTRIBUTION: Olivia Bishop speaking in this clip.]
