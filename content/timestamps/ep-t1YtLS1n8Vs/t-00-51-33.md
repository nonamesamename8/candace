## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**

Like it's a requirement, especially in today's world where they're getting, factually speaking, dumber and dumber every generation. And they're like, “Nope, we have the right to make them dumber and dumber. We have that right, and you give us your kids all day.” Yes, do it while you can and fight for laws so that that can never happen where you live. That you always have a right to your own children, which is ridiculous that we have to say this. But post-COVID you saw, they'll inoculate your kids. They'll be like, “Actually, we don't just own their minds; we own their bodies.” And we say 97 vaccines in order for them to be allowed to go to public school. Huh? I gotta let you poison my kid to let you poison their mind.
