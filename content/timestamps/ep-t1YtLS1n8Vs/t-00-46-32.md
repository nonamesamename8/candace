## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I just; I covered on recent episodes how they randomly, you know, you can really see how much power Israel has because they like put her on the cover of Time. And then suddenly they were like, “She had an octopus in a picture.” And they basically said she's Hamas. And it was very funny. It's very funny. It gets more and more ridiculous when you look at it. Miss Rachel and Greta Thunberg are Hamas. It's a weird angle. They're trying everything. I think they're coming a little bit undone because we're waking up. Marzi writes, “Hey, Candace (Candace Owens), did you see Theo Von's viral clip about letting Israel know that he is not going to end his own life?” My goodness. Why do we all have to do this? It's sad that people feel that they have to make public announcements. I had not seen it, but my producer says that he pulled the clip, so let's watch it together. [CLIP ATTRIBUTION: Theo Von speaking in this clip.]
