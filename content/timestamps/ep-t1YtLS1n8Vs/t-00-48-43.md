## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I also wake up every day feeling encouraged because there are good people that are now naturally rising, and I know that what that means is they have to artificially knock us out of the free markets. The ADL after this episode is going to do what they do and call, use their powerful influence to call YouTube like, “You know, last year what happened to me.” And I'm prepared for that battle because I know that we cannot let our children inherit this world.

Paul T. writes, “I'm in the private security sector. I see a lot of investigations.
