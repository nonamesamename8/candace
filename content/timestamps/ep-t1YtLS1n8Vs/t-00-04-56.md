## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> “and everyone conspired to instead attack a wealthy factory owner.” Like I said, to this day, they are using those mechanisms to try to gaslight us and to pretend that Leo Frank was really the victim in this tragedy. It's utterly demented. I will never let it stand. He killed Mary Phagan. He is still guilty of that crime, no matter how much the ADL tries to obscure that. And by the way, if you want to learn more, you should learn more about Mary Phagan's murder. I can point you guys; there's a book called The Murder of Little Mary Phagan, and it is written by a relative of hers. And that relative's name is also Mary Phagan. You should read the details of what happened 100 years ago. You should read the facts around it. Read the case documents.
