## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He, we learned, was a software engineer from Austria. So Austria, Germany, okay. Featured in Shaner’s Instagram. And that guy Scott Robbins that you saw looking like a college kid. Well, he was also a gubernatorial candidate. He ran for governor of Utah in 2024. Nobody mentioned this, I guess; all of these USA Today or AP, nobody asked them like who they were or if they were college students. And for whatever reason, everybody that they spoke to wasn't that. We will continue to grow this witness tree. Robbie Hilde—we've put a TBD on because we're getting crazy information on him. We're calling him Mr. Worldwide over here. Okay, we've got Robbie Hilde in the Cayman Islands. We've got Robbie Hilde in Spain.
