## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right. Happy Thursday, everybody. And I'm serious. You should be happy, and you should be merry because the tapestry is unraveling, right? I mean, there has been an extremely carefully woven tapestry of deception in all of our lives. And I think that Charlie Kirk's assassination, while of course it was a tragedy, has also worked to awaken the world to a deeper evil, something more sinister that sits below. So today we are going to talk about the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League, because suddenly Kash Patel wants to distance the feds from them. I don't really think that's possible. And I'm wondering why he chose yesterday to do that. Plus we received a few tips regarding the woman who is missing from the footage.
