## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And to survive, you got to have good instincts. You got to know that just because it's wearing a ball gown and is at Mar-a-Lago doesn't mean that it's not a gangster. It's no different. It's no different from where Jay-Z came from in the projects selling crack. It's just wearing a ball gown. It's at Mar-a-Lago. But that's still a gangster. I can recognize a gangster. And I don't think Charlie (Charlie Kirk) believed that or saw that until it was, I think, too late. Snake Girl writes, “I really love and appreciate everything that you're doing, Candace (Candace Owens). I'm in England. Would you advise I take my kids out of school immediately?” I would advise that immediately, no matter where you are in the world. Don't forget, Germany, they're not allowed to do it. Germany, they won, okay? The school system, the government won against your kids.
