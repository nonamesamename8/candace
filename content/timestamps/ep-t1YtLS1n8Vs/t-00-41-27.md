## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. You might have considered reaching out to my friends in American Financing but maybe decided against it because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate that you're currently enjoying. There's good news. They have created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution that's designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC, which can have varied interest rates, the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate, which means one predictable monthly payment, which gives you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off a high interest debt, free up your cash flow, plus keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront fees. You can call American Financing, and you'll start saving now. That number is 800-795-1210.
