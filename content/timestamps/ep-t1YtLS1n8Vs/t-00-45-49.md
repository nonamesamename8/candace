## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Maybe not everybody gets the new iPhone 8 as soon as it drops. Maybe you're gonna have to cut expenses in some category, but you can do it. And I told you, I was inspired by my sister who was very middle-class, you know, and she's an accountant. And she did it. She just made it. And I was like, “What is my excuse? What is my excuse to not do this exact same thing?” It is a blessing. I'm grateful for that. I'm grateful for my sister for ripping the bandaid off and making me feel like a total loser for not having done it sooner. Cassandra writes, “Hi, Candace (Candace Owens). Love you, girl. I've been following you forever. I know you are focused on Charlie (Charlie Kirk) case right now, but curious to know your thoughts on Greta Thunberg and the flotilla. Israel is committing an international crime right before our eyes.” I have not looked much into that story.
