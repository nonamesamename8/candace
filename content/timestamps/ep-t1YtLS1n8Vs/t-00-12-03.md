## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He addressed it in a series of tweets. Kyle Undercover wrote, “I gathered property records for the 19 different states that the ADL has a regional office established. The report reveals that in the state of Connecticut, the ADL shares an office space with the FBI.” They also share an office space with the United Nations in New York now. Same building, across the hall, whatever; that's a fact. And it makes sense. You shouldn't be that shocked when they're owning the fact that they share information. It's easier to share information if you're sharing an office space, right? Anyways, he goes on and he writes, “After reviewing the 19 ADL offices, we can see an alarming trend.”
