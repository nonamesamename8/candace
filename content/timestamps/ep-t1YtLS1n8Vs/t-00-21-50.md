## Transcript

She had seen the graphic imagery of the bullet piercing his neck and opening his neck up. I can't imagine what it was like to see that. My incident was just walking up. I was going through the event with a friend. And so I was in the back of the crowd still walking to get closer when I heard the pop of a gunshot. And people started screaming and running.
