**Candace Owens:**
> Well, Seven Weeks Coffee is on a mission to fund the pro-life movement, one cup of coffee at a time, and they just hit an amazing milestone: over $1 million donated to the pro-life movement. Why are they called Seven Weeks? Well, that's because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean, and it's the same time that a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. That's why they donate 10% of every sale to support pregnancy care centers across all 50 states, providing life-saving ultrasounds, resources for moms in need, and real hope for families. And it all started with one simple idea. Use your morning coffee to stand for life. Seven Weeks Coffee is more than a great tasting coffee. It's mold-free, pesticide-free, shade-grown, low acid, and it's organically farmed, so it checks all the boxes.
