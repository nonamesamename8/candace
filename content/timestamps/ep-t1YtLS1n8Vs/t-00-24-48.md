## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> We've got Robbie Hilde all over, all over. And so that's gonna take some time. We need to be more thorough in that. And we will have more on Robbie Hilde on Monday. Anyways, guys, this is a good time to... take a pause and read some of our sponsors. You guys know I love Riverbend Ranch. Their steaks are phenomenal. They really are just phenomenal. Black Angus beef that they have is literally famous for its great flavor. The Riverbend Ranch has taken Black Angus beef to a whole different level because over the last 35 years, Riverbend Ranch has been creating an elite Angus herd by using ultrasound to select genetically superior cattle with a focus on flavor and tenderness. Each year, Riverbend Ranch provides about 850 elite Black Angus bulls containing these special genetics to over 260 western U.S. ranches.
