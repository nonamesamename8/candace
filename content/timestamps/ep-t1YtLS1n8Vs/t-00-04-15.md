## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> even in the segregated South where people were just like, “Hey, give us any reason and we will go lynch a black person,” the racist segregated South, they still found him guilty. Okay. They still found Leo Frank guilty, and so much has been written to try to obscure this still. They are still trying to defend Leo Frank. What happened then is that his buddies over at the Freemasonic Lodge, B'nai B'rith, assembled the ADL to gaslight the public. “No, Leo Frank wasn't guilty.” “Look what happened after.” He was lynched for what he did to Mary Phagan. “He is actually a victim of antisemitism.” That's it. “He wasn't guilty.” “I'm sure maybe the black guy did it in 1913 Atlanta,”
