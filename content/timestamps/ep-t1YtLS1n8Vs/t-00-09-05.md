## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The ADL must pay for that. And sure enough, the FBI director, Kash Patel, announced yesterday that he ended—he has—this is over. Yes, the ADL was training FBI agents and sharing intelligence in partnership with the FBI. The FBI and the ADL had a partnership, sharing intel. They were training agents. And he says, no more. Okay, he wrote this in a tweet. James Comey wrote love letters to the ADL and embedded FBI agents with them, a group that ran disgraceful ops spying on Americans. That era is over. The FBI won't partner with political fronts masquerading as watchdogs.
