## Transcript

Rob McCoy steps in as the CFO, and there's articles about it, and essentially this organization sort of disappears overnight. Well, someone who was involved intimately—intimately—with this scandal messaged me and said, "Candace, no, you have it completely wrong because you're reading what's in the press."
