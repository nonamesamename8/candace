## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> Mr. Spears committed her to an eight-month tour named Circus. Tristar—that is Lou Taylor's company—was hired to serve as the tour's business manager, handling its finances and accounting, and the tour grossed an estimated $130 million—money that was now under the control of Lou Taylor and Jamie Spears, the father. So she was mentally ill, but not mentally ill enough to prevent her from making them more money and allowing them to control their money. So what we're describing here is effectively an infiltration. And instantly, Lou Taylor talking about God and prayers—that's a lot of what you start to see.
