> We would have no beef in the Middle East if it wasn't for Israel and us constantly protecting them from the trouble that they cause. But I'm not going to go off on a rant about that. Anyways, you guys—we also promised you—which I totally forgot. I'm sorry. I had a crazy Friday, you guys. A long week homeschooling. I also said to you that I would address who yelled at Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I totally forgot to get the last name of that person until I saw it in the notes just now.
