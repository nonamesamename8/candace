> And so if you have more information pertaining to that, please email moretips@candaceowens.com. All right, you guys. We're gonna take another brief break before I get into some of your comments. All right, you've heard me speak a lot about Nimi Skincare. I love their three-step anti-aging routines. It's done wonders for my face—which is why I'm so excited that Nimi Skincare now has a complete body line as well. Their Foundations Body Bundle. It's a simple three-step routine. You get the Botanical Bliss Body Wash to gently cleanse with soothing botanicals, the Revitalizing Sugar Scrub to exfoliate and hydrate with vitamin C and coconut oil, and the Restorative Body Lotion to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy.
