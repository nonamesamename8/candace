## Transcript

**Brett Cooper:**
> We need to understand a little more of Lou Taylor's history. So Lou Taylor became involved with Britney Spears in 2007 after she was hired to help manage Jamie Lynn Spears. And this was right around the time that Jamie got pregnant. Now, somehow—no one really knows. I mean, this is not documented at all. She was brought into the fold of this family by their father, Jamie. This is Jamie Senior. And by 2008—so less than a year later—Lou was going on TV shows as the family's spokesperson to speak on behalf of Britney. Lou Taylor is the business manager for Britney Spears' father, mother, and younger sister, Jamie Lynn. Lou, good morning to you.
