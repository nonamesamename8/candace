## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It would be foolish for us to think that Lou Taylor does not know Rob McCoy—exactly, right? All these people live in Thousand Oaks, California, and he's been pastoring that church up until July of this year for a very long time. And it's about to get even crazier because back in January of this year, someone notified me that Courtney Love wanted to reach out to me. So there you go. Brett Cooper has mentioned that Courtney Love has also had allegations about Lou Taylor. We all know who Courtney Love is. If for nothing else, it's because the media has convinced most people that she had something to do with the murder of her husband, Kurt Cobain, right? That's the reality, right? I didn't grow up with this music.
