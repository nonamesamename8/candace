## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Maybe that's why you're doing that. Doesn't mean anything, but I'm just pointing that out because we have to gather evidence that we're never gonna get from the feds. The second thing that I want to show you is what I just described—which is the clip of the person that I'm looking for who doesn't duck and calmly walks away. This is that individual. This is the front angle. You see that circle right there? We keep playing that. I've watched from other angles. Never goes down. Walks out of the bush. And I know that the police were looking for someone in a maroon shirt immediately after because somebody shared text messages with me that I did not publicize because I didn't want to.
