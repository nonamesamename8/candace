## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Kurt Cobain, Prince, Michael Jackson, Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And I should also mention Bob Bryar—talk about a—I don't know—timely or untimely death. My Chemical Romance. You guys remember My Chemical Romance? The drummer—well, he had an overdose at the right time, right? Kind of a crazy story. The drummer posts this onto Twitter. This was October of last year. This is Bob Bryar. He writes, "Easy answer for that." "Don't forget that Lou Taylor was my business manager for 18 years."
