## Transcript

> We have no evidence to show that he was actually talking to the bush. These are eyewitness accounts on that day. And I just feel that maybe something may have been going on in that bush, right? Now there is an individual that I have had questions about, and I have tried to discern through private means who this individual is, and I have had no luck. So I'm going to ask the public for help because he's had my attention for a while— foremost because throughout the event, I noticed that he was halfway standing in the bush. Obviously, I've looked at so much content—different angles, so many videos—and he's kind of partially in the bush. And I don't feel that it's necessary for him to be partially in the bush.
