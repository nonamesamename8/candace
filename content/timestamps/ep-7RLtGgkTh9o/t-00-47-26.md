## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, he may have just been hanging out—trying to get a ride, calling an Uber—because I caught the video. We really just don't know. But I got to follow this faith feeling I have—this quote-unquote faith feeling I have—and that's what I'm going to do. That is what I'm going to do. I'm going to follow my every instinct in this until we figure out what happened on 9/10 and beyond that, right? This feels to me like so much is being revealed right now, and the linchpin of this is a Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk assassination. And we are really understanding the way that our world works. So if you have any more information about Butch—some people were telling me that he was involved, and I have not been able to confirm this information with the military. I know his father was, but it's hard because they have the same name.
