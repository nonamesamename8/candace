## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I didn't have time to look into any of this and did not see relevance because at that time I was very much investigating the Brigitte Macron thing and was arriving very quickly at this weird backstory of MKUltra and the Haight-Ashbury Clinic when it seems like a button was pressed in America— and big psychological operations started to take place. And now, of course, we learn that this church that Lou Taylor's husband is a pastor at has this background that involves the CIA. They even explicitly tell the true story about all these hippies. Well, the hippie movement was not organic. It was not real. It was a psychological operation. That is a fact, okay? That is not a crazy musing. It is simply a fact that they brought this—and this really became a way to ultimately attack
