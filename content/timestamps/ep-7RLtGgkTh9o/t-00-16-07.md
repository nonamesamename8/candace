## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I know Lou Taylor built a house there and would find it very hard to believe that she does not know Rob McCoy—seeing that he was the mayor of Thousand Oaks and is the pastor of the large Calvary Chapel church there. Before Rob and Lou Taylor moved to Brentwood, Tennessee. I think Rob and Lou Taylor moved to Brentwood, Tennessee. They lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and attended a very large Calvary Chapel church there. And they were mentored by a man named Bob Coy. We brought him up yesterday—the pedophile scandal that we mentioned yesterday—who has since been embroiled in scandal for sexual allegations. And I believe had to step down. He mentored them in the process of starting their church in Brentwood, Tennessee. That's interesting.
