It just—it just—my mind just exploded understanding how severe a psychological operation could be: the media being complicit, convincing us that murders happened. I ended the book and I said, "Did anybody die that night?" That is how wild of a journey it is—the same year, of course, as the moon landing—entire psychological operation. And you just go—what is real? What is not real? I don't know.
