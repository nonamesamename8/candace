## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I think post-COVID we're all ready to digest that these are psychological operations. Courtney—at that time—Courtney Love told me so much information in January of this year. It was like—she basically wrote me a novel. I couldn't process it. It was information overload. And if she had sent that to anybody but me, someone would have looked at this information and said, "Oh, this is just crazy." "She's crazy—truly." "She's obviously insane" because people that are outside of the Hollywood matrix cannot grasp or comprehend what goes on inside of it. It's spiritually so offensive that we go, "There's no way all of this can be going on." And then you join my book club and you read Hollywood Babylon—you're like, "Oh, this is actually how the system was built in Hollywood." It was built off of this stuff.
