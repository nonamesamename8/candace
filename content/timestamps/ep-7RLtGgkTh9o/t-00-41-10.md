## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It was not that crowded of an event. There was definitely space. The second thing that's compelling is that he's wearing a maroon shirt. And when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) goes down, he stood out to me because everyone ducks, but he just sort of keeps standing and seems to be— go inward—into the bush—and then out of the bush. And then I saw him from behind, and he's very calm. He never ducks, and then he sort of calmly walks away. Want to be clear—does not mean he's guilty of anything. But I'd like to speak to him because he might have some more insights as to what was going on in that bush.
