## Transcript

**Brett Cooper:**
> Read this. Mr. Spears at times gave 10% of his conservatorship income to the Taylors' Calvary Chapel Brentwood—a practice known as tithing—according to a 2010 financial document. Mr. Spears gave tens of thousands of dollars in one year alone to the church, which is about 500 miles away from where he lives in Louisiana. Now obviously since then, all of this information has come out, and Britney has now accused Lou of playing a major role in her exploitation. And even though Lou denies all of this and continues to deny everything through emails obtained through Britney's trials, it is clear that in some way, Lou was involved. This is from the LA Times. Britney Spears' lawyer emails show ex-business manager helped set up conservatorship.
