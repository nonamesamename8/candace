## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> She attacks Candace (Candace Owens). The context of calling somebody the heiress of Turning Point USA would make sense— if you're referring to Erika. That's about it. That's literally probably it because she quite literally was the heir to Turning Point USA. Like she became the chairman. But that was—that's weird.

"I've recently realized we are at war, and the direction that this timeline of the world is literally going in is at stake." The fate of the future of America—down with the two-party system.

Stay focused, my friend."
