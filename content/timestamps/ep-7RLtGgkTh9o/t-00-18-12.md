## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**

Actually putting journalists on payroll to control our minds. If you are new here, you absolutely must read that book. You have to understand how this thing works. This is why I put together my book club—because it's so much that you just start to wonder what is real, what is fake. Are we actually living in a simulation? How could I have believed all these things about people on the basis of what I read in the media because they gave you some sort of an authority, right? They present themselves as some sort of authority, or they have expertise in this area that they fact-check.
