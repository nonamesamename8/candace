## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> Here you have Britney that needs to have some security somewhere that every single thing she does and every single person she has a relationship with doesn't become an opportunity to be exploited.

Every day, Jamie goes to work as a professional chef, asking the Lord to give him the strength to honor the people he works for in the midst of circumstances. Lynn Spears is a mother that is brokenhearted just because she's apart from her daughter, that she loves her daughter so much, and again, asking every day for God to give her strength and for her to continue to have hope.
