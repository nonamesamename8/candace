## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Well, I put this up on my stories this morning, and two other people reached out to me who worked with Lou Taylor and described exactly what she's referring to—this system of tithing that Lou Taylor makes them say 10% has to go to the church if they want to be blessed. I'm not kidding. 10% has to go to the church if they want God to bless them. This is why they should do this. And then also directing them to invest in other companies without necessarily revealing that they're involved in those other companies and that God will bless them and they'll pray over them. What is happening? How can there be this many Calvary Chapel scandals and stories? She also mentioned Lindsay Lohan. She's not lying there.
