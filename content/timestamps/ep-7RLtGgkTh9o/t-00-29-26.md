## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> "Bill Gates' grandfather—also LDS, polygamist. Not hard to dig any of this stuff up at all." "The corrupt Fed who called off the 2006 investigations into CNB Bank for Mike Hertz estate and Tupac." And then this is a question mark: "Are Todd Nielsen? That firm is still massive, but he had to then go be one of the 12 apostles to the new prophet in Salt Lake and with Ensign and NGO." And she goes on and on, and she starts speaking about this. And when I say I received—I just had no idea what she was speaking about.
