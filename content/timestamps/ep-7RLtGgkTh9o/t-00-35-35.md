## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That's been a topic that's been in the news recently. And I go back to something that was very strange when people were telling me what happened in the Hamptons before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died.

Nothing should send to you a louder alarm that you should aspire to own property. You have every right to live where your grandparents lived, where your mother lived. Ancestry is very important, and I feel that they are trying to wipe that. And we are somehow at a very critical point. And I don't know much.
