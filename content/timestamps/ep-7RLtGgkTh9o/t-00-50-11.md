## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I wanted to also address why I teased two things for you—actually—that did not happen today. The first was not my fault at all. The person that was supposed to come on the show—who has been basically effectively working on the finances for months—asked me to just wait one more week because he got swept up into something. So that was a cancellation. The second thing is the Egyptian plane. That—the thing about the Egyptian plane—is so explosive. Like I said to you, I had to try to get this to the right people in government. And those individuals asked me to wait until this weekend. The reason why they wanted me to wait is because this is the first time that we have the advantage. I don't know what to say other than it's—it's positively explosive. That's all I can say to you and presenting this to the public.
