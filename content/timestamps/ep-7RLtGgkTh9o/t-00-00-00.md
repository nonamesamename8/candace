## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. Happy Friday. And I'm just gonna jump right in and tell you that somehow all of my investigations are converging. Like literally all of them that we've done on this show, and I'm freaking out. I would have never thought in a million years that there would be something that connected the Chaos book—which I got obsessed with and [that] it's required reading for this podcast— connected to the Brigitte Macron case. I'm gonna tell you about that, connected to Ye (Kanye West), me telling you all about what happened behind the scenes when he was effectively kicked out of Hollywood, and the reason why I refused to publicly condemn him despite insistence from the brood of vipers.
