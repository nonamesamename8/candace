## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> publishes an article—the most bizarre headline I've—what? All respect to Allie and the work she's done. "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk's TPUSA heiress" is how we're describing her—like— what? I'm sorry. What is that? Actually, what op are we in right now? Where the heiress to Turning Point USA is Allie Stuckey. That is a wild headline. And they repeated that—the heir apparent—in the Wall Street Journal. That's weird. It's weird because it's wrong, and it's not true. That's why it's weird. Not because she couldn't be an heiress or an heir to something, I suppose—but it's just totally wacky to try to fit that in there. That's very strange.
