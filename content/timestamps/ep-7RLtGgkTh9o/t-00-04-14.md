## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's unbiblical. It only furthered my sense that faith had somehow been infiltrated. Faith had become a military operation—or perhaps from the '60s onward, that's what it's always been, right? Too many instances—as I showed you yesterday—of trafficking and sexual abuse. You have to begin asking the question whether or not this is systemic and it's on purpose and who these pastors are working for. But I get an email yesterday which made me perk up—a flurry of emails, actually. Thank you guys—telling me to stay the course because the Calvary Chapel was also involved in Britney Spears' conservatorship. What? Excuse me.
