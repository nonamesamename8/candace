## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Ginny writes, "Hi Candace (Candace Owens), fellow Latin Mass Catholic here." "Which saint's relic do you have behind you?" "There is a special reason you have this saint." Yeah, I spoke about this on another show. It was gifted to me by a priest while I was out in Wyoming, and it is from St. Michael's Holy Cave in Italy. So yes, I was very grateful to have that, and that is a very powerful prayer of protection. Rianne writes, "Hi, this is Rianne from San Antonio, Texas." "Thank you, Candace (Candace Owens), for never giving up on the truth." "You are Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s David." "May God bless you and keep you and your family safe." "I love you, sweet girl." "Christ is King." "Go, Max." Go, Max. Indeed, we are going, Max. Truth Accountability writes, "Candace (Candace Owens)." "Remember, the devil is striking hard because God placed something powerful within you."
