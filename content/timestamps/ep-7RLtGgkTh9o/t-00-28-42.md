## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> "So who is it that doesn't drink, doesn't gamble, but they run Vegas? And a lot of the Jews that are in Hollywood—Lou Taylor for Kim Kardashian and Diddy." "Jay-Z, Beyoncé—and she also owns the home church, Churchome, to get Bieber from Hillsong." I looked that up. That actually is accurate. It looks like she owns or sat on the board of Churchome. I know you Bieber people—people that were doing the videos about that—know a lot. That seemed to be accurate and made no sense to me at the time because I'm not hip. I don't follow a lot of the Hollywood stuff. Then she says, "Christian non-denominational, but she's LDS." "Born and raised LDS."
