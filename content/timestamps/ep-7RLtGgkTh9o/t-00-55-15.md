## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> People are showing up to Calvary Chapel because they love Jesus, and they want to pray. And suddenly they're starting to realize you're getting a political message. Something is not right with Calvary Chapel. I stand by that. We lost someone that has an email and said—because I discussed Calvary Chapel's abuse history—they would no longer support us.

Most of all, when I start to recognize that something happened at Turning Point USA and the faith movement seems to be at the center of it—it's very bizarre. The lies—actually, when you start to go through the list of Turning Point USA lies—so many of them surround the topic of faith, which is very strange.
