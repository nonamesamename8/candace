## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm going to put this out there because I think a lot of people now need to start paying attention to the Calvary Chapel in whatever regard you're researching—whether it's Justin Bieber, as I just mentioned, whether you're looking into the Courtney Love thing, or whether you are focused on the Britney Spears thing. You need to look here. We need to understand what is happening inside of these churches. And I am definitively not letting go—obviously—of this TPUSA faith infiltration, which is what it looks like to me. We're going to take a brief break, and we're going to come back and speak about the notorious bush that we left off on a couple of days ago. Alright, you guys. I've been speaking to you a lot about Riverbend Ranch because I absolutely love their steaks.
