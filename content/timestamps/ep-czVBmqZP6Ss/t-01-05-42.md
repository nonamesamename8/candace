## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I didn't follow Charlie (Charlie Kirk) but was moved by his passing— a little something for security and no more ‘over your dead body’ talk. We need you. Stay strong and safe.” Thank you for saying that. And I'm here. I'm here. I am obviously still not okay. I don't know if I'll ever be okay from having watched that, but I am focused. Mandy writes, “Christ is King and hopefully is returning very soon.” Tony Hill writes, “I constantly pray for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and his family as well as you and your family. Their plan is causing division in our country. We need to take what they did to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and come together to fight their evil, not each other. Candace (Candace Owens), we have your back.”
