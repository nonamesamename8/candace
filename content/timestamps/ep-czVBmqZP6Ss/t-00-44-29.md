## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He's making noise. He's signaling that he's somehow shot the guy. And at 12:52, it gets announced that the suspect is in custody. So nobody needs to look around anymore because the suspect is in custody. But actually I guess George Zinn just does that. He just does that, I guess. Just wants people to think he's done something, but he hasn't actually done anything. That, again, to me, feels like he's a decoy. More people are involved in this, and I will say that. We don't know, but we know that something's wrong with this. Then at 12:29 p.m., we have TMZ showing us that there's a person running through the backyard. They are saying this appears to be the suspect running.
