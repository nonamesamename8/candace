## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> What if they were actually built by and for real builders, you know, the people? That's the question that GNOLand asked and that's why they built GNOLand. They started with Golang, which is a language that real world developers already use, and they built a platform all around that is transparent, intuitive, and it makes sense, not some confusing system of ones and zeros. It is open source, so imagine GitHub, but designed for on-chain collaboration and composability. Builders actually get credit for their work and they get rewarded, so every time their code gets used, that's the real value in this. It's not likes, it's not clout, it's actual rewards. GNOLand rejected Proof of Stake, which is a system where the rich really run the show.
