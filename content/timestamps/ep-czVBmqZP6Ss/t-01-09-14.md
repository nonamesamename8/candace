## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I want to say to everybody else who is lying on behalf of certain people, I know who you are, okay? I know who you are too. I'm writing that down, so tread carefully, you know? Because I wouldn't want to get caught up in lying right now. I wouldn't want to be you and be caught up in lying right now. Because the truth is going to win. The truth is going to come out. We'll see you guys tomorrow.
