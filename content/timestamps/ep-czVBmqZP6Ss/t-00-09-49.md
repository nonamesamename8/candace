## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Again, you would think he was busy fighting this 97,000-front war, but no, he's letting you know that he just randomly, what, picks up the phone and calls Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and invites him to Israel. How did Benjamin do that? It seems like maybe there's a little more to the story. No, there definitely is a little bit more to the story. First and foremost, that letter he is holding up, he is severely misrepresenting. Those sentences are real, but I am calling upon Benjamin Netanyahu, the dear friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), to publish the letter's entire contents. Like, don't start with just two sentences, publish the entire thing. You're holding it.

## Claims Made

- [factual] In May, Charlie Kirk was concerned about Israel and their influence on American politics and how they were pushing things that he felt were in conflict with his beliefs
  - *Follow-up:* Full publication of the letter
