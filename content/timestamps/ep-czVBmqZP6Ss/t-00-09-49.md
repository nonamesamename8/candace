## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Again, you would think he was busy fighting this 97,000-front war, but no, he's letting you know that he just randomly, what, picks up the phone and calls Charlie and invites him to Israel.

First and foremost, that letter he is holding up, he is severely misrepresenting.
