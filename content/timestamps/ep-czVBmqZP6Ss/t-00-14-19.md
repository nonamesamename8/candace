## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And Bill Ackman was on Charlie about comments that Tucker had made on that stage. Tucker specifically asked the question, where does Bill Ackman's money come from? You know, who is this guy? Actually, who is this guy that has this much influence? And like I said, Bill Ackman was not happy about this. And so I would like to contextualize Benjamin. Again, these are things Benjamin brought up publicly, which he didn't have to. He didn't have to bring up the letter. He didn't have to bring up the phone call, but he chose to do this, less than 24 hours after Charlie was shot. Personally, Benjamin, I would have appreciated if you guys used all of your spyware you had spying on us for years to maybe track down the killer.
