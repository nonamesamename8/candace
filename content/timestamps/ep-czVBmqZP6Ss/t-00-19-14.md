## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I sent him Bill Ackman's tweets because, you know, he tweeted, “I feel incredibly privileged to have spent a day and shared a meal with Charlie this summer. He was a giant of a man.” I said, any comment on this one, Seth? He didn't answer last night. This morning I said, need a comment ASAP, please. He didn't answer. Then I followed that up and I said, trying again here, you were present when Ackman lost his mind on Charlie and when Benjamin invited him to Israel and Charlie refused. Text messages immediately following this meeting are circulating. I find Ackman's statement, as though the meeting was somehow cordial, to be incredibly disturbing. Are you at all disturbed by that tweet?
