## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And he was under an increasing amount of pressure, not just people telling him, oh, well, you know, I'm upset with who you're inviting, but flat out telling him that he was not allowed to invite certain people to his events. They were threatening to pull out money. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was getting a lot of really nasty text messages, and many of them pertaining to Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and Candace (Candace Owens), but Tucker (Tucker Carlson) was really the focus when it came to AmericaFest. How could Charlie (Charlie Kirk) allow these debates about Israel to take place? How could he allow Dave Smith, who by the way is Jewish, how could Charlie (Charlie Kirk) allow this other position to meet the stage?
