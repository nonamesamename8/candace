**Candace Owens:**
> Neemee will be matching every donation made to Turning Point USA, helping expand chapters across the nation and strengthen his mission moving forward. Here's how you can take part. Go to tpusa.com and make a donation of any size. Then simply forward your receipt to faith@neemieskincare.com. Again, that is faith@neemieskincare.com and Neemee will match it dollar for dollar. Charlie (Charlie Kirk)’s impact was bigger than any of us could have imagined, though he was only 31. He inspired millions of Americans of all ages to think critically, to courageously stand for truth and to live with faith and purpose. He welcomed us into a community that inspired courage, conviction, and hope. So if you are able, please go to tpusa.com and make a donation and forward your receipt to faith@neemieskincare.com.
