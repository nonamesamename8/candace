## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It only takes 10 minutes to get started with no upfront or hidden fees. Call American Financing and start saving now. Call 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210 or visit americanfinancing.net slash Owens. That's americanfinancing.net slash Owens. Also, in times like these, we are called to do more than just grieve. We are also called to act, to strengthen our resolve and to carry forward the values that Charlie fought for every single day: love of God, love of family, and love of country. Neemee Skincare reached out to me because they want to encourage donations to Turning Point USA to ensure that Charlie’s legacy does not just live in memory. It continues to grow.
