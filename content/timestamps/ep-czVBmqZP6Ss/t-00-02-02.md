**SPEAKER_1:**
> Beautiful, powerful words. Charlie had just one wife. What we got to see across this weekend is that there were so many people around the world, like she said, who were deeply moved by Charlie Kirk throughout their lives and of course have been deeply moved by this tragedy and what she is describing there, that fire. A lot of us are feeling it. I am definitely feeling it. I had a very tough weekend, a very tough weekend. I will say this: my entire life, I've not been much of a crier. It is not my choice emotion. I'm not a person who bursts into tears. And many, some people are like that. This weekend, I didn't just cry. I wept. I wept. I wept for Charlie.
