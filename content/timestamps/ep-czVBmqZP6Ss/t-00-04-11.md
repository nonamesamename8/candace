## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The song is about the ability to find it within yourself, to become what you know you are capable of becoming inside of a matrix, when you just realize everything is dishonest, that everything is performative, that people are dishonest, that they are going to try to stop you from being great. In fact, it's the end of the song, the question that he asks at the end of the song, that's the most important. Ye asks, do you have the power to let power go? Do you have the power to say no to power? You know, I told you guys that Charlie was going through a spiritual transformation at the end and all of the usual suspects were really angry that I hinted towards that. “What do you mean? You don't want to say that.”
