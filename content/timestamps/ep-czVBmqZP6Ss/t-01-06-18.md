## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Yeah, I know I've been a little snippy because it's really hard to see people, especially going back into, like, every message me and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ever shared, that did nothing but try to destroy him. Like, just the pretense of nobility stresses me out. It does. But I won't—every week I will get better. And I'm trying. I am trying to be gracious and not angry. Anger is my choice of emotion at this moment. Divine Council writes, “Candace (Candace Owens), I have joined you as a voice for truth. I changed my channel the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)’s murder and I took my mask off. It’s hard being a black conservative. Please look into the book ‘The Thirteenth Tribe.’” I've heard a lot about that book. It's about the origin of the Ashkenazi Jews, the Khazars.
