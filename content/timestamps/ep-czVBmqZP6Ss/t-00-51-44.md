## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Did the pastor just say he did it? Did the father say he did it, but they didn't have any proof? Again, this is obviously—everyone's investigating. We yield to them. Do I think this kid was involved somehow? Yeah. Do I think he did this alone? Absolutely not. This story makes entirely no sense. And then there's this random Discord, over Discord, okay? So Governor Cox came out and told us that there were messages about the rifle drop point. Okay. Discord says not the same thing. Let's listen to Governor Cox say that on this social media app, Discord, they were discussing the rifle drop point. Take a listen. (Clip: Governor Cox)
