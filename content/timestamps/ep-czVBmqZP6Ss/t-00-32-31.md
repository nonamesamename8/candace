## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, I'm gonna take a pause, we're gonna go to some sponsors and we're gonna get into what we are being told by the agencies. There are definitely some holes, maybe more is coming out. First, this is fantastic that Preborn is doing this. Every heartbeat tells a story and at Preborn, they give moms in crisis the chance to hear that heartbeat for free. And that's exactly why I partner with Preborn, because Preborn isn't out to judge women. They're making motherhood possible. They provide free ultrasounds. They share the gospel of Jesus Christ. And more importantly, they stay after the baby is born with real practical support by giving expecting mothers diapers, baby clothes, and even housing and financial help for up to two years after the baby is born. That's what true Christ-centered compassion looks like, and that's how you can be a part of it.
