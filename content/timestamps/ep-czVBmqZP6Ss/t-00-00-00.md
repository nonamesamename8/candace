## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys are going to jump right into this with no introduction. There's a lot that I would like to speak with you guys about. Can't wait to hear your feedback. A lot of lies that are being put out there and narratives that I would say are half-truths or just misrepresentations entirely. And I don't really see the reason for that. First and foremost, to let you know, last week was not a dream. Charlie (Charlie Kirk), my friend, is dead. And he was publicly executed. I want to make that clear. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was publicly executed before the world. And as we were all searching for answers, the ones that are being supplied to us are not making a lot of sense. And some people, I would say, are speaking too much, are speaking on behalf of other people.
