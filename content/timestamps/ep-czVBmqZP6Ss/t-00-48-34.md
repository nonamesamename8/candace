## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> It's just like a random fashion show while you're going to murder someone. I just want to change my outfit for funsies. And then we hear that Tyler Robinson, when he's apprehended, it is communicated to us that he is wearing the maroon outfit. Now, I want to be clear. They said this was 33 hours later. So he changed his outfit, I mean, ostensibly because he wants to avoid detection would be the only thing that I think is reasonable to assume. But then he changes back into the outfit that he was wearing before the shooting, for what reason? Thirty-three hours later, like no shower time? He wanted them to know that it was him on the camera? That's not clear to me. Why are we changing outfits?
