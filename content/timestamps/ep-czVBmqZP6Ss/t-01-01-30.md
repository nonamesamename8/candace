## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's like all these people who supported them and then suddenly they come under pressure to effectively lie or to go against their morality. That's not normal. There are so many books that can get you started on your journey, but if there's one that I would recommend everybody read because you need to understand the beast that you're dealing with, what kind of lies are willing to be told and sold. I would say right now, at book club—and you don't need to join that—but you should read “The Assault on Truth.” It's a good start, okay, to understand that Sigmund Freud is celebrated in schools as the father of modern psychology. He is the father of nothing but modern gaslighting, and that's what they do. They gaslight repeatedly, okay? Don't believe your own eyes.
