## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now, does all of this mean that Benjamin Netanyahu and that this somehow proves that Israel was involved in the assassination of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? No, we have no evidence of that. We can't say that because there is no evidence of that. But I don't like little lies. That's what I will say. Something that I always say in my household is when there is one lie, there's 20. There's no reason to lie. Benjamin could have gone on Fox News and he could have told the truth. He could have said truthfully that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) has always loved Israel. He has always loved Israel as the Holy Land.
