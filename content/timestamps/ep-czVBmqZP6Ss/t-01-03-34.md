## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> But if you just want to jump right into Israeli history, I would say Shlomo Sand would be a good start. “The Invention of the Jewish People” is a good one. And he took a lot of flak for having written it, standing up to neo-historians, which is who we are also fighting. They are neo-historians. They publish a lot. And you believe they're kind of creating this matrix of history, that there's very little truth there. Kari writes, “All death can do to the believer is deliver him to Jesus.” That's fantastic. And you are absolutely correct. Jordan Giacolini writes, “Pray for Candace.” M. Skim writes, “Go Candace, go, but be careful.”
