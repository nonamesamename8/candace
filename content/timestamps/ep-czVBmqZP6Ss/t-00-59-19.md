## Transcript

Talked to her about my heritage, Armenian, and she shared that she and her husband cared deeply about my people. At the end of the conversation, she let me know that she let me know she is Charlie (Charlie Kirk)’s wife, Erika. She made me feel welcome when I was alone. God be with the Kirks. If there was anything that could rile Charlie (Charlie Kirk) up, it's questioning his moral integrity.” Yeah, they are very, very good people. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Erika are fantastic people. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did things the right way. And so watching these snakes—oh my, let me just stay calm. Just gonna get through this—as if you're just gonna slide into Charlie (Charlie Kirk)’s chair.
