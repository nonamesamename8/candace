## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was surrounded by his friends, quote-unquote friends. Bill Ackman was very upset and threats were made. That is what I am told, and I will tell you that I am very happy for Bill Ackman to dispute this narrative. In fact, he was asked to dispute this narrative. Max Blumenthal went out to him today and Bill Ackman came back and said, I have receipts, I can show you. And he did not provide the receipts. And “this is not how it went down.” I know it went down this way. I'm waiting for one of them to go on record and to say that it didn't go down this way.
