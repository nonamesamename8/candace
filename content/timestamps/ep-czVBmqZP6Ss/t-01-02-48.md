## Transcript

> I think that kind of woke me up and led me to researching more about the history of Israel, and it started with the gaslighting mentality and the father of it. I would definitely read Shlomo Sand. There is a book called “The Invention of the Jewish People” that gets into Israel full stop. He was, I believe, a professor, a historian, at Tel Aviv University. That's an important one. And you will note that all these books that I'm recommending, by the way, were written by Jewish authors because that makes you aware of the fact that you're not diving into something that can be labeled anti-Semitic. Because, I mean, these people were like in the IDF, you know what I mean? And so there's no incentive for them to lie.
