## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's why reading about Sigmund Freud is very important, to understand what modern psychology is and how much they have invested—how much time they have invested—into thinking about how they're going to raise up your children, okay? It is wicked, it is evil, it is disturbing, but you need to know it. You need to know it. Read “The Assault on Truth,” process it, and recognize that when you grew up, you were told to honor that monster, okay? Up is down and down is up. Question everything. We certainly will be questioning everything. Ciara writes, “Candace, after I posted my prayers to Charlie’s family, I was blocked and removed by people I once considered close to me. It's sick how many people I see in my everyday life that support such an ungodly act.
