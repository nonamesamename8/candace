And by the way, they're willing to kill us all the time. I mean, that's what they're doing. And you know, over the centuries, when Jews, especially in the Middle Ages, the horrific Middle Ages, the worst things were said about Jews you could possibly believe. We were poisoning the wells, we were drinking the blood of Christian children, you name it, I mean these things. That continued actually up to the Holocaust. The Nazis said the same thing, you know, we're carrying vermin, we're spreading disease. And people believed it.
