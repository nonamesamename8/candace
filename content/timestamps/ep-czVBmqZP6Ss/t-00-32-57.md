**SPEAKER_1:**
> And more importantly, they stay after the baby is born with real practical support by giving expecting mothers diapers, baby clothes, and even housing and financial help for up to two years after the baby is born. That's what true Christ-centered compassion looks like, and that's how you can be a part of it. For just $28, you will give a mom a free ultrasound, one chance to see her baby, and when she does, she's twice as likely to choose life. Preborn is on a mission to save 70,000 babies this year, so don't just say that you're pro-life. You can also live that. Donate now. You can call 855-601-2229 or head to preborn.com slash Candace. Again, that's preborn.com slash Candace. Also remind you guys about GNOLand, because what if smart contract platforms weren't controlled by elites or big tech?
