## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So what's interesting, already confusing to me, is that TMZ shows him already walking. We're supposed to believe he walked, parked his car and then walked onto campus. They're saying that after that video that you just saw of him walking, he got into his car, and then drove to campus and then at 8:29 p.m. on campus is when he arrives. Already confusing, but let's just keep going. We don't need to poke holes. Let's just keep going with the narrative. Then we're back to TMZ and they release that at 11:49 a.m. they have footage of the shooter, who has now changed his outfit. We're supposed to gather that again on a doorbell cam, and he's in a different outfit.
