## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It was at this time that Benjamin Netanyahu was called and Charlie was invited to Israel. This was an under duress situation, I would say, because I've been in these situations before.

And just like Charlie was being invited to Israel, I was invited somewhere else. And when this arrived to me, it felt like a threat.
