## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Let's stop saying how Charlie (Charlie Kirk) felt. And instead, if you're gonna hold up the letter, release it in its entirety, okay? Why don't you release your messages, Bill? I'll release mine. Let's all just be very forthcoming about what took place. In fact, I'm calling upon Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to speak about that. I know what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said to him, and I'm sure Tucker (Tucker Carlson) won't lie about it. What did Charlie (Charlie Kirk) say to you? Dave Smith, what did Charlie (Charlie Kirk) say to you? What was Charlie (Charlie Kirk)— did he seem like he was treading in the direction— do we feel like what Benjamin is saying is an honest representation of what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was going through? This is what I want. I think that the thing that we need here, sunlight is the best disinfectant.
