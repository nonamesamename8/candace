## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> just realize what's happening today. You have to also recognize what Israel—how it came together. You have to start with Sigmund Freud, the early Zionist movement. Theodore Herzl, his connection to him—why they were connected. We talk about this on my book club. Even if you can't join the book club, you can still buy those books. And so I would start with "The Assault on Truth" by Jeffrey Masson, and then move on to this most critical book, which is "Sigmund Freud's and the Jewish Mystical Tradition." I think the combination of those two books are absolutely potent to the Zionist narrative. I truly do. And you'll also start to recognize the psych tactics that they use on us—the gaslighting. That is why they celebrate Sigmund Freud—because he mainstreamed gaslighting people that they harmed.
