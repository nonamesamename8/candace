## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Noah writes that AIPAC is going to try and stage a hostile takeover of Turning Point USA. I think that's already happened actually—and I think it had been happening for a while—and I am looking to get some evidence of that for you guys. But I'm hearing some things. More is going to come out because we're not going to let this go. Raven writes: "Brandon Briggs said on his last day's show to pray for Candace (Candace Owens), Alex Jones, and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson—bold voices that are exposing darkness. May Jesus Christ of Nazareth protect them all." Thank you so much. And do pray. Pray, fast. These things work.
