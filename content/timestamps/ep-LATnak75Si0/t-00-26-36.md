## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I am telling you, there is no way that we can break bread. The Israel-first movement—like I said—is a true cancer. It just wants to destroy. There is so much hate. But I also want to be clear that they are growing increasingly dangerous because they are radical at their hearts—because these are the descendants of Bolsheviks. This is not something just to laugh at. It's something to pay attention to, okay? Because if they're going after Brett Cooper in this demonic of a way—someone who's just a bubbly girl who speaks mostly about pop culture—and now they're trying to dig up content and say that she's a witch, we're supposed to drown her, burn Brett Cooper at the stake—then where does that put the rest of us? And their rhetoric is getting dangerous. They're saying another 9/11 is coming. I'm going to tell you guys about that in a little bit. Don't go away.
