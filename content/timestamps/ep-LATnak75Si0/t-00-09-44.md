## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Looks like the plan maybe failed despite the billionaire bucks that were flowing into the anti-Mamdani campaign. He won pretty handily against Andrew Cuomo—which, like five minutes ago, the Republican Party was telling us he was unbelievably corrupt and that he should be in prison. And all of a sudden it was our duty to get the word out, to get people to vote for Cuomo somehow again. Bill Ackman almost personally ran against Mamdani, right? At times, he even demanded to have a debate with Mamdani—which I don't understand the context of why Mamdani would be debating Bill Ackman if he's not running against him. Point is, Mamdani won, okay? Bill gave $1.75 million, and Mamdani won—irrespective of the money that was donated against him.
