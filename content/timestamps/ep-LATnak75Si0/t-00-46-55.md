## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Lastly—and switching gears here—what I want to say to you, and this is building upon what I said earlier, is: pay very close attention because all of the wrong people—and by this I mean the pro-Israel crowd—are signaling hard to us that another 9/11 is coming. They're jacking up the jihad rhetoric: everyone's a jihadist; Muslims are coming; the Muslims are here; Mamdani—there's a jihadist threat; something big is coming. And the Pentagon— like where the Department of Defense is housed—the Pentagon, which was implicated in 9/11—a lot of questions about what the Pentagon was up to, money, a lot of questions about the Pentagon— they have just given press passes.
