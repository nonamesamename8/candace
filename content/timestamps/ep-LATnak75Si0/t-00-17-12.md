## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And in case you missed it, yesterday they started attacking Brett Cooper. Brett Cooper—23-year-old, bubbly Brett Cooper. She makes the majority of her videos dedicated to pop culture. Yes, she covers things that are—I would say—mainstream politics. Nothing too daring. Never speaks about Israel. And she did her part, by the way. Zionists wanted her to do her part and encouraged New Yorkers to get out and vote against Mamdani. But it's not enough, of course—because this is a radical ideology. You give them 100%. You even say one critique, and they don't want to break bread with you—they want to destroy you.
