## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It would have been all hands on deck for the memorial event. And when they came back and began scheduling posts on Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) channel, the first post they scheduled was Mikey McCoy's speech. It was a picture. I'm gonna show you this. Look—so it goes in order from bottom to top. So you see you've got Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Ben; you've got Charlie (Charlie Kirk); Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and Jack Posobiec; you've got Charlie (Charlie Kirk); you've got Charlie (Charlie Kirk); and then it stops. And then when they bring the channel back—even before they put Erika's speech—they put Mikey McCoy and his wife. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. This stinks to high heaven. Okay. Of all the speeches you could have picked to put first, right? You could have picked JD Vance. You could have picked Trump (Donald Trump). You could have put Erika.
