## Transcript

**SPEAKER_7:**
> Like Randy Fine—if you don't know who he is—he's a representative from Florida. He's the same guy who bragged about not washing his hands after he had a handshake with Netanyahu (Benjamin Netanyahu). He's repeatedly introduced bills to criminalize anti-Semitism, infringing upon free speech. I mean, he obviously—I'm sorry to say—but he obviously cares more about Israel than he does, you know, principles like free speech. So, buddy—like, my advice to you, Randy Fine—is just move to Israel at this point. Like, considering you had to go through anger management classes a few years ago, I genuinely think you would probably be happier if you just moved to Israel. And that's what I dig at him. That's just a fact. It's a nudge of encouragement. I want everybody to be happy. I want everybody to be healthy. I think you would be happier if you just moved to Israel. You could be over there singing songs with Mike Huckabee. Seems like pretty sound advice:
