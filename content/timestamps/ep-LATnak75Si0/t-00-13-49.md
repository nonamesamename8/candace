## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I will never forget during the presidential debates—they were all wearing. The majority of them. I think there was only Vivek Ramaswamy who was not wearing the Israeli pin. I'm like, "What are you—you're running for president of the United States. What are you doing wearing the Israeli flag as a pin on your jacket?" No one can answer these questions, and they do the same thing: "I love Israel more." "No, I love Israel more." "No, I love Israel more." Keep in mind, by the way, Mamdani won—and New York has the largest population of Jewish people of any city in the world next to Israel. So that says something, okay? And he still won. Now, did he get the majority of the Jewish vote in New York? No, but the exit polls are quite stunning. He got way too much of the Jewish vote in New York, I would say.
