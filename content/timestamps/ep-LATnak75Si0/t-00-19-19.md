## Transcript

**SPEAKER_7:**
> You are so blinded by your ridiculous, insane hatred of Tucker (Tucker Carlson) Carlson that you could not see how irresponsible and hypocritical you are being. I mean, these tweets from Ted Cruz—I'm going to read you next—are a great example of this. So just a month ago, he tweeted this. He said, "They don't kill you because you're a Nazi. They call you a Nazi so they can kill you." "Political violence is a left-wing phenomenon. Enough is enough. We need to shut it down." And then in response to Fuentes and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) this week, he tweeted this: "Trump's (Donald Trump's) bombing of the Ayatollah's nuclear facilities made the little Nazi mad." So now you're turning around, and you're calling somebody that you don't like a Nazi. You're doing this out of blind rage because you're so angry that the conservative base's attitudes are rapidly changing—that Nick Fuentes is getting national attention—so you have turned around in response.
