Anyways, the second thing—if you have that footage, if you can see if that box is moved—I would like to know if that box is still there four minutes later when they start taking down the equipment. Second thing that is bothering me—or, you know, one millionth thing that is bothering me— is Mikey McCoy's instant phone call. We've already discussed it. It's strange, okay?
