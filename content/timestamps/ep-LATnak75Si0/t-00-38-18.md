## Transcript

**Blake Neff:**
> "I need to call Erika." And then he takes his phone, and he begins calling Erika. And I don't want to disclose how that call unfolded, but he did that. This—you know—your mind extends all of this, but that is happening within a minute of all of this occurring. I remember he calls Erika. I, around the same time, I pull out my phone, and I call my mom just to say, "Mom, there's been a shooting. You're going to see it on the news. I'm okay. Pray for me. I've got to go." And I remember that call. And around the time I put that phone away—and then he immediately calls his dad. He calls Rob McCoy. And he says, "Dad, someone shot Charlie (Charlie Kirk). You need to call all of your pastor friends. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was hit. We need everyone to pray right now."
