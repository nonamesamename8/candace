## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And we know that they got to the hospital very quickly because Blake Neff says elsewhere they got into the hospital within 25 minutes. Okay. They knew—that means they knew instantly where the hospital was. They knew which direction to go to. The communication that's flowing. I think Frank said he was on the phone while they were in the car with his family members. Don't quote me on that. So all of this happened. You instantly got to the hospital—which, by the way, the hospital was put on lockdown when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) came in. That's what we were told. They let Mikey and the Turning Point boys in. Maybe that's true. It sounds like it is true. Obviously, we know that you were there when they came out and said that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had died—according to Blake Neff and according to Frank Turrek's testimony. But a lot of this little stuff is not making sense, okay? It's not making sense.
