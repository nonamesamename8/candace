## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Truth Social posts to ensuring that Mamdani would lose than to ensuring that Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s murderer was found—900% increase in messaging coming from him, since he didn't even send one message about investigating Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s murder. But the question is: why didn't MAGA listen even to Trump (Donald Trump)? Why didn't we all get on our platforms and say something? Because people like Dana Loesch want to know: how are we going to win if you guys don't use your platforms and encourage people to vote? Well, the answer is pretty obvious. We don't recognize this MAGA because the fact that you're in it makes no sense. You were never Trump (Donald Trump). If you're telling us that MAGA is now Josh Hammer, then MAGA is not MAGA, okay? MAGA needs a new leader.
