## Transcript

**SPEAKER_9:**
> I remember even running—past both of us going past the—you know—the SUV that we came in on—and me thinking, "Should I get in that car?" And then thinking, "No, that's a really stupid thing to do." And then I kept going. So I was not with Mikey, or I don't remember being with him. I think I was ahead of him as we left, and we get out, and I run for— it must have kind of been more than 15 or 20 seconds. And then I realized there hasn't been another shot. So the shooter is likely detained or stopped or something—not in immediate danger. I pause; I look around me, and I see Mikey. And I see Mikey there, and I'll never—truthfully, I will never forget what I saw because I've seen Mikey almost every day for the past two years. I know his personality very well.
