## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You don't fly to Utah and then go back home to Arizona and then fly to Utah 10 days later. Nothing is making sense, and we need to get to the bottom of why that is. This is looking to me—and you can let me know if you agree—it's looking to me like the apparent plan was to assassinate Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who had at long last faltered on the pro-Israel cause. Okay, his words, not mine. And then to stage a hostile takeover of his brand and of his legacy by pretending that his best friends in the world were like Susie Wiles. Susie Wiles and co. Somehow she made it onto the stage to eulogize him at this very public event. It's so publicized, we can't even doubt.
