## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's actually one of the most compelling and moving conversations I've ever seen Brett Cooper have. It's a very powerful episode of "The Sean Ryan Show" because she tells her backstory, and you realize how much substance she has and the things that she lived through. She lived through a lot. This is somebody who had twin brothers, and one of her twin brothers dropped dead from a heart attack unexpectedly. And when she describes the dynamics of what they went through as a family—meaning things you don't think about—having an identical twin brother, and then one half of you—you're literally a split cell—dies suddenly. What that does to the other twin brother who has to walk by the mirror every day and see his brother—but his brother's actually dead.
