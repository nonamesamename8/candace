## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The 12-23 minute has got to be over by the time he sees his lip quiver, by the time he says, "I have to call Erika." And then he's gonna call Erika, and I'm supposed to believe what? This was a 15-second phone call? "Hey, Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) been shot. Gotta call you later." Like, 'cause I gotta call my dad and ask him to pray? By the way, that one too doesn't make sense. You could call your dad after you call 911. I mean, there's so many things that would happen before I called my dad and asked him to pray. If you're really gonna snap into it. And I know for a fact also that one of his first phone calls—it wasn't just two phone calls he made; he made three. 'Cause he also called Elizabeth McCoy, his wife, who screamed at the office. Okay? And so we're not being told the truth. That's what I'm getting at. We are not being told the sensible truth.
