## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> not caring at all about American lives in my viewpoint—not taking a stance whatsoever for the freedoms that people in the past have fought for. Like, this administration is not even fighting for free speech on college campuses anymore. And it's a turnaround. It is a 180 from the Trump (Donald Trump) that came down the escalator. I will not support it. You're not going to convince me that this is the MAGA movement. It's not. And the reason I know it's not is because all the Never Trumpers are praising it—and I've always been against Never Trumpers. So if Trump (Donald Trump) joined the Never Trump party, then good on him—but I'm not following him there. And that's what I'm going to say on that topic before we answer some of your comments. We'll throw it to a few sponsors. All right, you guys. The Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that is great news for American homeowners.
