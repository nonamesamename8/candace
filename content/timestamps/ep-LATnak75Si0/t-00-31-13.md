## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm sorry, but that's just objectively funny. It's funny because they're being serious, and it's funny. "When we get to the core of the issue," yeah—she's an anti-Semite. Yes, she hates women. She hates Black people. "When we get to the core, she's just a disgusting person." All right, cool. Let's keep plodding along. Couple of updates on the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) Kirk story and something that is really bothering me in the back of my mind. Actually, a lot of things are bothering me, but here are two more things that are bothering me. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was never rendered any first aid immediately. I know the security team. I know that one of them is supposed to administer first aid immediately. We don't see that happening. I've seen everything from different angles. When he's down on the ground, they don't put any gauze on him.

## Claims Made

- [factual] Charlie Kirk was never rendered any first aid immediately; security team did not administer first aid, no gauze, no hand on wound.
  - *Follow-up:* Review security footage from UVU event for first aid administration
