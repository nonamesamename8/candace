## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I'm gonna bring in Mark in my ear to mansplain what we're seeing here on the exit polls. Mark, can you please mansplain? Yeah, as you can see, it looks like despite not winning the Jewish vote, he got a huge proportion of it. 32% is pretty insane for allegedly how anti-Israel he is. And even deeper in here, you can see that Israel was a factor in a lot of these people's votes. This is according to a CNN exit poll of about 4,700 people coming out. Really, it's an election for mayor of New York. I don't see what this has anything to do with that. Yeah.
