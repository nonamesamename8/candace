## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Michael Bloomberg also gave money to a Cuomo-affiliated super PAC. He gave $8.3 million to stop Mamdani, and it didn't matter. The Airbnb co-founder, Joe Gebbia, gave $3.1 million. It didn't matter. The Tisch family gave $1.2 million. It didn't matter. Still Mamdani won. Why? Okay. If we're being honest, he probably won during the first mayoral debate. Okay. Just like if I reflect upon 2016, Trump (Donald Trump) kind of won in the first Republican debate because he was just kind of saying "F you" to the establishment, and it was pretty apparent. I want you to take a listen to this question.
