## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Michael Bloomberg also gave money to a Cuomo-affiliated super PAC. He gave $8.3 million to stop Mamdani, and it didn't matter. The Airbnb co-founder, Joe Gebbia, gave $3.1 million. It didn't matter. The Tisch family gave $1.2 million. It didn't matter. Still Mamdani won. Why? Okay. If we're being honest, he probably won during the first mayoral debate. Okay.
