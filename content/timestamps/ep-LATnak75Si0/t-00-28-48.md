**SPEAKER_1:**
> I also want to tell you guys about SaunaSpace because when you're a mom with kids and a nonstop schedule, you're still expected to look good, feel good, and function without losing your mind. That's why I'm obsessed with SaunaSpace. You've seen those red light panels that are trendy, but this is totally different. It's the Glow Infrared Therapy Light from SaunaSpace. It helps with screen fatigue, and it's amazing for my skin as well in the morning. It's like a natural sunlight. It's warm; it's comforting, and it resets your body clock. And at night, it helps you relax and get ready for a seriously deep sleep. You can even use it as pain relief on sore muscles or cramps. And the real game changer is their Fire Light Sauna. It's portable, and it's powerful, and you're getting red light therapy and an infrared sauna all in one. It's your personal wellness sanctuary.
