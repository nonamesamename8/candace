## Transcript

**Josh Hammer:**
> "New York City—for the time being—it looks like you're pretty screwed. For the time being, it looks like you are literally going to have a Karl Marx-quoting, Hamas-loving, red-green alliance sicko." Yes, he is an absolute sicko. "You're going to have this guy as the next mayor. A quarter century—just under a quarter century—actually, after 9/11—after the largest Islamic mass terrorist attack in global history, certainly in American history. But find me another single casualty event that killed that many people as were tragically killed on September 11, 2001—a day that, as a native suburban New Yorker myself, I remember all too well."
