Also, I'm gonna tell you guys about Seven Weeks Coffee because if you've been listening to this show, you know that Seven Weeks Coffee isn't just a sponsor for us—it's actually a part of our daily routine. We drink it every morning, and honestly, I cannot imagine starting the day without it. And it's not just about the taste—it's because the coffee stands for something that we deeply believe in. Seven Weeks Coffee is America's pro-life coffee company on a mission to fund the pro-life movement—one cup of coffee at a time. They're called Seven Weeks Coffee because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean. At the same time, a heartbeat is clearly detected at an ultrasound.
