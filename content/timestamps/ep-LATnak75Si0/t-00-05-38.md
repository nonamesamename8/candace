## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The reason why they have to plan these so far in advance is because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) travels like a madman, okay? He's not a person that has nothing on his calendar. And they can be like, "Yeah, sure. Let's just do this event randomly." The second thing that was driving me crazy as well—which was completely atypical—is the fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was slated to speak in Utah on September 10th and then was... due to return just 10 days later to a different campus in Utah that's under two hours away. That's not how they plan events. Okay, the idea is if you're going to fly and you're already going to be in that corridor, try to do those campus events back-to-back. We did UCLA, we did Berkeley, we did Stanford. You do a sweep overnight, over two days.
