> And you cannot tell me that to dispel this rumor—right?—by letting people see the call logs, by letting people see the video footage—would somehow hurt the case. Because that's the BS they're selling us right now. Like, "Transparency would hurt the case." And like I've said: if transparency would hurt the case, then it's because you don't have a case, okay? If transparency would hurt the case, it's because you don't have a case. And if you're telling me that your phone logs on that day— your phone logs on that day—would somehow hurt the case. You are asking me to be an idiot, and I can't be an idiot. I can't pretend that I was born yesterday. You're lying. They're lying about the phone calls. They're lying about the timing of the phone calls. The phone calls don't make sense. So I wanna say that. I'm gonna chill.
