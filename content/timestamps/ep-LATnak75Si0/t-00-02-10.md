## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I know how Turning Point operates their events—things that the world does not know. I have been privy to. And that's why I said, "You know what? Let's actually scour through my emails." I was like, "Savannah, let's just go back so that we can share these things with the world—that you guys can join me in my frustration of wanting to punch somebody, anybody in the face, okay?" So yesterday we had mentioned to you that the timeline is absolutely absurd, okay? The absolute absurdity of Turning Point—as we learned—having received a request from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—I'm sorry—from UVU for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to speak on their campus in mid-July, okay? Just a few weeks before he dies.
