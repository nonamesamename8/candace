## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This is our country, you guys. That's it. You know what? I'm going to take my 19th trip to Israel. Oh, well, I'm going to take my first trip after my son's bar mitzvah. Oh, I was planning on stopping over on the way for our honeymoon. We were going to stop and just go to Israel and do whatever we could. It's ridiculous, and it's obvious. And the way that the establishment comes down—if you don't peddle those talking points—he says something totally normal. "Yeah, I'm going to stay here in New York. Why do I have to make a trip to Israel?" And he says, "I'd rather work with the Jewish New Yorkers that are here." That makes sense. Why are they all coming down on him? Why have all of our politicians, left and right, sold us out? Okay. Republican Party.
