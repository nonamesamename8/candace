> *(Clip from Carrie Smith)* I do think it's a cult. I think she is exhibiting several cult tactics. She's demonstrating several different tactics. I think she's using manipulative language and a lot of cluster-B personality disorder behavior. I think that it's easy to observe that, but apparently it's not easy for some people, I guess. And I'm assuming maybe that's because they haven't been through that before with someone. Maybe they haven't experienced it before. And so this is not an episode for people who are in that cult. It's not an episode for people who are just hanging on every word and following it. I've interacted with quite a few of you, and I'm not trying to convince you.
