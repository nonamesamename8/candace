## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So what happened to me was that I saw Charlie (Charlie Kirk) get shot in the throat. But I do want to—can you just bring her up for a second without playing it? I can't be the only person that's really stressed out by how she's organizing those books. Like that is like—I've—that is—I don't like the way those books are at all. That really is stressing me out, so... Whew, she's lucky I'm not nine months pregnant because this would not fly. I would be organizing that. Why the different levels? Anyways, she's queen of diagnosing this, I guess. Cluster-B personality. Now, what I will say is this is—if you go back any fed operation—COVID—whenever you don't follow the federal narrative, if you don't listen to the government, they always diagnose you with Machiavellian—what do they call it?
