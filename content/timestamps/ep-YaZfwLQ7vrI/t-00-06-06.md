## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If you're on the right, own it. We were like, "The left is bad." "They're overthrowing an election." We did it. On January 6th, 2021, I can tell you where I was. I was nine months pregnant—my first child—and I was super MAGA at this time. I would have definitively gone to this stop-the-steal rally, but I was just too pregnant to go. And I was living in D.C., so it was just down the street from me. And I reflect on that, and I think, "Wow, that saved me," because I could have been swept up in what happened on January 6th. I could have been there. We all know how the story goes. Trump (Donald Trump) hosts this speech. He has this rally. And then afterward, people—quote-unquote—storm the Capitol, break through the barriers. And there's an insurrection, and CNN is showing these clips in the footage.
