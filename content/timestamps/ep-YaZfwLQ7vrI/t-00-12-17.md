## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That's three days after—saying "stop the steal, be strong, be courageous." And Lance (Lance Wallnau), who is a charismatic preacher, wasn't the only charismatic preacher or pastor that instantly threw their weight behind quote-unquote stopping the steal. Actually, four out of the six protest permits that were issued on January 6th were issued to independent, charismatic Christian groups, okay? Fifteen of these pastors and leaders surrounded Trump (Donald Trump) at the White House leading up to the January 6th Stop the Steal rally, telling him that the war was now spiritual. So they're in his ear: "This is spiritual. This is what you have to do, Mr. President," okay?
