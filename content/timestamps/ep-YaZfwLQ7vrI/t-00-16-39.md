## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> These characters keep coming up, and there's a pattern that I'm noticing that a lot of these mainstream pastors and preachers actually come from high-ranking military families. High-ranking military families have been around for a long time: ties to the Navy, ties to the Air Force. Frank Turek (Frank Turek), Air Force. Rob McCoy—we discussed about his background, his naval background, psychological operations. They're literally named like a fleet of ships after his father—like there was like the McCoy naval something. Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau)—he's no different. He graduated from a military academy. His father, Carl Wallnau, was a major in the United States Air Force. Wallnau served under General Patton.
