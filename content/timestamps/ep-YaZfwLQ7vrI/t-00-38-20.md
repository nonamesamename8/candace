## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anyways, the oddest response came from Mark Levin, who has been kind of psychopathically obsessed with destroying Tucker (Tucker Carlson) for years now. He was very happy when Tucker (Tucker Carlson) got fired from Fox News. They don't seem to be friends. And regarding Mark Levin—if a person was actually like, "You should move to Israel because it would make you happier"— if that was a person, that would be Mark Levin, okay? Turning Point USA—credit to them—said, "We are not canceling Tucker (Tucker Carlson)," despite the peer pressure—despite them sending out every queen and pawn on the board to make that happen. They said he's still speaking, and not only is he speaking, but why don't you debate, Mark Levin? Debate Tucker (Tucker Carlson) on stage. And this is how Mark Levin responded.
