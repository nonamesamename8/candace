## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> This is a headline from the BBC regarding the Thousand Oaks shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill: the Las Vegas shooting survivor being among the dead. We're not getting answers to any of these questions, and they're telling everybody that these are just conspiracies. It's always a conspiracy when you start questioning these fed narratives. One survivor said that the group of them were meeting up for a second time in about a year—having, I guess, like a little Las Vegas reunion—and that's why they were all there. Following this, a month after this, Rob McCoy then gets elected mayor of Thousand Oaks.
