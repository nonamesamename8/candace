## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We are basically saying we would have taken the bare minimum and maybe accepted some of this narrative. They're giving us nothing and telling us to swallow it whole. We just can't do that, okay? We just cannot do that. Mickey Shaw writes, "We love you, Candace (Candace Owens)." Well, you know what? Go tell that to cult lady. She's going to be really upset about that. Aries Girl writes, "Seven Mountain Mandate—you're referring to." Makes me think of Satan tempting Christ in the quote from Elder Ephraim: "The person who limits his mind to the name of Christ, the hour of death, the beauty of paradise, and the love of God will purge it of every demonic contemplation." The note here is Ephraim was a revered Greek Orthodox hieromonk —does that say hieromonk?
