## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And for just $28—that's what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion— $28 helps her to see the life that is growing inside of her. It gives her truth that the culture most definitely will not. So you shouldn't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. Be unapologetically pro-life. Go to preborn.org/Candace right now and give $28. You can give 10 times that if you're able to. This is definitely the line that we have to stand on: standing for truth and what is right. We can save lives from abortion, and we can stand firm in the gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace. Provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also, when I tell you guys about Goldco, because what are you doing today to protect your tomorrow? Waiting until later? That's not really an option.
