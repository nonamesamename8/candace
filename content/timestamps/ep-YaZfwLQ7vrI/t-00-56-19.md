## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was too brilliant to just ask a question. He would have arrived at the answer very quickly. He learned very quickly, processed information very quickly. And to the extent that he was paying attention, he would have found out. That's just a fact. It is not a small thing. They tried to reduce it. It's not a small thing that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) suddenly was wondering about where the money was coming from and where it was going to. On that note, later on this week, we'll be having a guest join us that will speak on Friday about Turning Point's finances, and that's going to paint a big picture.
