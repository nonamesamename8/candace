## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So we will pause there before we get into some of these bizarre responses that I've been going through—militant responses that I've been going through on X from Christian Zionists. We'll be right back. All right, you guys. I'm going to tell you about PreBorn! because you know that I think it's time for all of us to stand up for truth. We have to be courageous. We have to be done playing defense. We shouldn't water down what we believe to be palatable. Silence is not actually kindness. It is consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds the topic of lives that are lost before they even take their first breaths. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, we have to act like it. And that's why I'm asking you all to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love.
