## Transcript

**Allie Beth Stuckey:**
> Think. Turn on your brain. The thoughts we think and the words we say not only affect real people's lives, but they carry weight in eternity. We are responsible for these things. I'm going to take that seriously, but you should too. Look, y'all. I don't even want—I've just been wrestling with this so much over the past few weeks. I don't want the drama. I don't have the time and energy that it takes to go through—to make all of these claims. First is incredible, but then to go through and debunk all of these claims—I don't have that time; I don't have that energy; I don't have that capacity. I don't.
