## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Sources within Turning Point's faith department tell me that Lance (Lance Wallnau) was running the show behind the scenes through funding—that he put a ton of money into Turning Point USA Faith operations. Now, I guess a better way for me to state this—because I want to be super clear here—is that Lance Wallnau, who is from a military family and who is saying that he believes in infiltration as a means to climb mountains and overtake society— however, he just described that, right?—was privately directing large sums of money into Turning Point Faith. Okay. He's friends with Rob McCoy.
