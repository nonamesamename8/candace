## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now, Frank Turek (Frank Turek)—this didn't stop him, or it didn't make him go warn Charlie (Charlie Kirk) about this in any way as these people began to infiltrate his organization, and Lance Wallnau (Lance Wallnau) worked his way into Turning Point USA. I had a phone call with someone, by the way, who's extremely close to this current administration, and they said—completely offhandedly—we were not even really discussing Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—but then they said, "You know something that's really weird? I was at Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) memorial." She said, "When did Turning Point become so faith-focused?" She's like, "I remember obviously Charlie (Charlie Kirk) always spoke about his evangelical faith." She's like, "But when you guys were running around and starting all these Turning Point chapters, it was all about free markets and capitalism." And she was like, "And I was at the rally, and it was suddenly faith, faith, faith, faith—pastor, pastor, pastor."
