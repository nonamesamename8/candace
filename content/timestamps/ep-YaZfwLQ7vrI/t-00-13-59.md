## Transcript

**SPEAKER_3:**
> *(Clip from Lance Wallnau)* Hi, I'm Lance Wallnau. I want to talk to you for a moment about this concept called the 7M Mandate. In reality, it started with a conversation I had in the year 2000. I had been talking to Loren Cunningham, who's the founder of Youth With A Mission, and Loren was sharing with me about a conversation he had had with Bill Bright. The two of them were visited actually by the Lord within the same 24 hours, and God spoke to them and said they had a message to give the other man. And the message was that there are seven molders of culture or seven world kingdoms, and that he who could take those kingdoms could take the harvest of nations. Now this illustration is the way I see it. I look at it this way.
