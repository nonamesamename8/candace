## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And it's funny for me, especially because I was right up the road, and as a resident of D.C.—literally living there. And I was thinking how strange it was. I'm sitting on the couch with my husband. We start getting all these phone calls—like from my sisters and family members—asking if we're okay. And we didn't have the news on, and we're like, "Yeah, we're okay." "So strange that you're calling." "We don't even hear any noise." And it was actually the first time that there was peace in D.C., meaning it was the summer of BLM riots. So it was strange that we never got called when people's cars were getting smashed and things were being burned to the ground. But suddenly we were getting phone calls because the media was there, you know, right there. "The MAGA has gone too far," and they were showing all this footage, and it was out of place, right?
