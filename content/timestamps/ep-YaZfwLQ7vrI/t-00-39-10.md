## Transcript

**Mark Levin:**
> *(Clip of Mark Levin reading Tucker Carlson text exchange)* I got a very strange text this morning from Tucker (Tucker Carlson)—10:16 a.m. I'll read it to you verbatim. "Good morning," he writes to me. "The leadership at Turning Point has asked me to debate you at their event in Scottsdale in December." "I'm happy to do it, and I hope you'll agree as well." "Beyond the personal insults—which I'll try to keep to a minimum— there are real and important ideological differences between us." "And I think the country would benefit from an extended conversation about them." "So again, I hope you'll accept." "Let me know." "Thanks." The guy is desperate. He's taking a hit on his podcast. He's fighting like hell for his career.
