## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot—for whatever reason, you know—Kash (Kash Patel) injects himself into it. The feds seized all of the footage at the hospital that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was brought to at Timpanogos. That doesn't make sense to me. Nothing makes sense to me in this whole story. So this is just kind of the icing on, you know, on the top here—not even the icing on the top. But why would they move to seize that footage? How is that going to help their investigation? What's happening inside of Timpanogos? How is that going to help their investigation? Their immediate boots-on-the-ground investigation into who shot Charlie (Charlie Kirk). They're trying. They're on a manhunt. Why are they going, "Okay, let's at first grab the footage at Timpanogos"? Does that make sense? Were you worried?
