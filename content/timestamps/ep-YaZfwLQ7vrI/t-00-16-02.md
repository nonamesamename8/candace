## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So what he's describing there—and what they believe—is that there are new prophets; there are new apostles. They have the Seven Mountain Mandate, and when he is speaking about covertly, he means that, okay? This is a philosophy of infiltration. He says, "But before people even know—boom."

Man, I got to say—kind of sort of reminds me of what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk), right? This is kind of where this is going. Turning Point Faith—everywhere that I'm investigating, Turning Point Faith keeps coming up.
