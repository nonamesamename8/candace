Also, I want to remind you guys about American Financing because the Fed just dropped interest rates again, and that is great news for American homeowners. If you're feeling overwhelmed thinking about the upcoming holidays, there is no better time than right now to get your finances in order. It's hard to think about the holidays when everything is just so expensive and your credit cards are already pushed to the max. With the rates dropping, now is the time to think about paying off that debt. American Financing is helping homeowners access the equity in their home for instant savings. They're saving people just like you an average of $800 a month, and many are seeing rates in the below fives. That is a complete game-changer compared to those sky-high credit cards. If you start today, you may be able to delay two mortgage payments, giving you extra breathing room for the holidays.
