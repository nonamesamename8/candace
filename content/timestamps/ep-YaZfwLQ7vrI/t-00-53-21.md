## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Stephanie writes, "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) knew that you would have the strength of iron against their fighting words when the battleground was set." "You are truly armor-bearer." "Be my David." Yeah, they've cited that as well. And I was like, "I just shared Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) messages, and he knew he was going to die." And that is actually—in retrospect—incredibly compelling. And I wish I had... I guess there's nothing else I could have done. There's really nothing I could have done. I have to remind myself of that. Zamet writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), number one worldwide secret sauce." "She speaks to us, not at us." Yeah, we're just trying to figure out what's going on, and we know that what they're telling us is going on is definitely not what's going on. And my requirement is pretty easy: Are you interested? They're asking you to be an idiot. Just be an idiot.
