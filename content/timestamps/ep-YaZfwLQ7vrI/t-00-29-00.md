## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Joel Berry, who also is at the Babylon Bee—he's a real funny guy—wrote this. "In the last year, Candace (Candace Owens) and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) have given our side nothing but demoralization, division, confusion, and conflict." "Their impact on the right has been devastating." "They've made us weaker, and they've won nothing except clicks and ad revenue for themselves." Pathetic. Strange. I've never been on the same side as Joel Berry. Just want to clarify that. I am never on the side of people that cheer on kids being killed and churches being bombed and insinuate—as he did—that even the Christians in Gaza are really human beings and that they're all supporting Hamas, which is basically justifying a genocide, right? Justification of genocide. I have never been on your side.
