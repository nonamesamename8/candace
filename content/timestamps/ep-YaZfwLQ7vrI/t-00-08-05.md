## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anyways, this weekend—after five long years—finally the person, and I'll say allegedly because I guess we're going to have to wait for the feds to dispute this, but the person responsible for dropping off those pipe bombs was revealed to be a fed—more specifically, a 31-year-old woman and a United States Capitol Police officer named Shawna Rae Kirkhoff, right? A man named—a reporter named Steve Baker—who just deserves all of the credit on this amazing discovery. And I'm going to let you listen to Glenn Beck, who is interviewing Steve Baker (Steve Baker), to tell you about how he came across this footage and how that went down.
