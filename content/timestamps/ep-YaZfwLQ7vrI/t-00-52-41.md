## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Whether you're—there's nothing that's going to protect you. Being a woman's not going to protect you; being black is not going to protect you; being Jewish—none of it's—it's just not going to work if you're going to use identity politics. And right now, it is just the case that Zionists are being a little cray-cray—a lot of cray-cray—very cray-cray—and kind of dangerous. Also, I want to tell you—by the way—one of the things that she mentioned as a sign of a cult was me reading comments at the end. Obviously, you guys pay for me to read these comments, and you guys compliment me—which is very kind. And so she said that me reading your comments is a cult-leader tactic.

Thank you so much for that donation.
