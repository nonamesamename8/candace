## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> In real life, I worked for Turning Point USA, and I know what does not make sense in terms of the timeline of how this event came together. And in real life, if somebody suspects you in a murder for any reason whatsoever, and you can put something out publicly that will clarify a fact that isn't correct—if you say it's not correct—you would do that. You wouldn't hide. In four seconds, I would say, "Oh, this is—oh, the reason why I was on the phone with someone, so I had nothing to do with anything." So people are following their instincts because they should. But I just want to remind you—as it bothers me—that was Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) real life, okay? That was Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) real life, Allie (Allie Beth Stuckey), right? And move on from that. See, you're stressed out. I'm stressed out too, to be honest with you.
