## Transcript

**Mark Levin:**
> "I debate people with whom I disagree for a living who are a lot smarter than you, but for whom I have some respect." "I'm also disappointed in TPUSA that continues to platform you." "It's not about free speech." "You can be heard by millions regardless." Some unsolicited advice: "Stop long enough to remember who you used to be and what you used to stand for." So, as expected—knee-jerk. For the record, I'm strongly anti-Nazi. Does he sound that way to you, America? Oh, you're going to hear more. But that's hardly the point. This seems like the perfect opportunity to rebut what you consider evil ideas and to do it to my face like a man.
