## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We're actually already living in the later. You should consider adding gold into your financial strategy because when economies destabilize and the markets get scared, currencies can lose value, but gold does not always follow suit. Having some gold means that you are not 100% dependent on just one system. You'll instead have something tangible. For me, it's about planning, and it's about protecting. Of course, I'm not saying that you should run and dump everything into gold because that would be as misguided as sticking with just stocks. But balancing your investments is crucial. If you're worried about retirement or you're worried about the current economy, then let this be your little nudge.
