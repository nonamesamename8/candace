## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Oddly, about 40 people who were at the Las Vegas shooting were all at the Borderline Bar one night when a Marine whose family knows Rob McCoy—well, Rob McCoy is friends with that Marine—that Marine's mother decides to storm into a bar and conduct a mass shooting. And a victim of that bar shooting was a 27-year-old Navy veteran who had survived the Las Vegas shooting. So it just makes me wonder: was he a victim, or was he a target?
