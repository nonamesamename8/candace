## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Elle Reeve did not even get to my book at all. She didn't mention my book at all—which is quite stunning in retrospect by the end—because she was trying to hammer me—not on the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) stuff—but she was trying to hammer me so much on Zionism—you know, Israel—is kind of what she wanted to speak about. And then Brigitte Macron is what she wanted to speak about. Anyways, speaking of this book—I loved seeing this online: "Make Him a Sandwich." Somebody in Serbia got the book, and her husband fake-signed it. He forged my signature, and he wrote to her—I can't read her name—"Dear Kiki, please make me a sandwich," and I can't read that—something, something—and then he signs it himself. He signs it "xoxo, Candace (Candace Owens)."
