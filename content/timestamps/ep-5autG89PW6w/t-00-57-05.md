**Candace Owens:**
> One winner is going to receive a $500 shopping spree to neemyskincare.com, but the most beautiful part is a gift that will be given in the winner's honor—which is that $500 gift basket will be delivered to a new mom, and a life-saving ultrasound will be donated through Preborn. On top of all of that, during the entire giveaway period, 10% of all sales from Neemee will be donated directly to Preborn. To enter and to be a part of this incredible mission, please go to neemeeskincare.com/life. You can get bonus entries by following @neemeekincareofficial on Instagram and sharing the giveaway post. So let's come together. Stand for life. Visit neemeeskincare.com/life. All right, you guys. I'm glad I held it together.
