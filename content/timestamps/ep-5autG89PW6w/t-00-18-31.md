## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> He knew—I cried on the phone with Andrew. He knew how I was feeling. And then I went under a very—well, you could say a blitzkrieg, right?— a heavy bombardment from people who he knows hated Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who tried to stop Charlie (Charlie Kirk), people who had no issues showing up to his memorial. I mean, really gross stuff who were attacking me. And he could have at least provided some cover. Now, I'm not saying that I need help, but sometimes it's nice to offer somebody a lifeboat when they're being attacked for telling the truth, right? So I do want to say that. Also, I'm glad that Andrew responded correctly because I was going to say this when Blake's like, "Well, you know, the investigation is ongoing." That text message has nothing to do with an investigation whatsoever.
