## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. Happy Tuesday. I gotta tell you something. Twitter, or X, it hasn't really been that fun in a really long time. I think Elon Musk clearly gave it away to the military, and we now have to suffer these military bot farms calling for war with Iran. But last night, the platform was exceptional. It was amazing. The tears that were being shed all over the place. I mean, I really picked out the best responses to me dropping the text messages. It was hilarious. Anyway, Turning Point USA has responded to the release of the messages, so we are going to watch that. Spoiler alert: they were real, of course.
