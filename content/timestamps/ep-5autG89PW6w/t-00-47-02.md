## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If there were circumstances where a suspect or someone standing trial for murder did not have a clean opportunity to receive the very best and fairest legal representation to present their case and defense to the world, it would have been abhorrent to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). It would go against every constitutional principle that he lived, fought, and died for. Erika is in mourning. May God bless her and her family. Please give her and her family time to grieve. Any civilized culture—Christian or otherwise—allows a grieving widow 40 days of mourning to make peace with the Lord and to respect the departed. Those people who truly love her would gladly grant her all the space she needs. We certainly do. But we are growing rather sick and ashamed of seeing people criticize Candace for doing her level best to get to the bottom of and to the truth of what happened to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on that day.
