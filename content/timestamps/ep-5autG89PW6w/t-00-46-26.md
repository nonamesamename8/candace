## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This investigation and the truthful answer as to who was really responsible for deciding that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would be executed in front of the world will affect America's future, its collective soul and conscience forever. The truth, when known—and we believe it will be known—will have far-reaching international consequences. The very idea that someone could be convicted and could receive the death penalty when there remains even the slightest shadow of doubt or shred of uncertainty that they may not be guilty of that crime—and that Christian souls would tolerate that possibility—is anathema to all the teachings of Christ.
