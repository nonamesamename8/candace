## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's free of flavors, allergens, or preservatives, and it's vegan-friendly. Fatty15 has three times more cellular benefits than Omega-3 or fish oil. It comes in a reusable glass bamboo jar, and refills are shipped right to your door. Fatty15 is on a mission to optimize your C15 levels to help support your long-term health and wellness—especially as you age. You can get an additional 15% off their 90-day subscription starter kit by going to fatty15.com/Candace and using code Candace at checkout: fatty15.com/Candace, code Candace at checkout. Also telling you guys about SaunaSpace because obviously if you're a mom—if kids' non-stop schedule—you're still expected to look good, feel good, function without losing your mind. That's why I'm obsessed with SaunaSpace.
