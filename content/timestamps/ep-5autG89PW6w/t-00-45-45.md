## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He would have worked night and day to uncover exactly what had happened to his great friend. Consider this: Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not sleep for several days and several nights just to ensure that JD Vance became the vice presidential nominee. And although that job was supremely important for the country and its future, it was still ultimately simply helping to secure a job promotion. Candace is working to get to the truth of who killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and why they did it. Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s execution is an assassination with potentially far-reaching political consequences for America and the world. What we have seen so far beggars belief: a crime scene apparently completely destroyed in days and plenty of evidence that simply does not add up.
