## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I'm glad to hear that Frank Turk shared that. Linda writes: "Girl, you made me cry. God bless you. I'm praying for you. Ave Maria." Thank you. John and Irina made me cry, so it's really their fault. If you want to be angry at anybody, you can be angry at John and Irina for writing that. I did. I felt the Holy Spirit in those words.

Sending prayers for Mississippi and stay safe." Thank you so much, Turtle Mama. We're all actually doing this thing. So thank you guys for supporting me on this journey.

If it's centralized, you can just whack it.
