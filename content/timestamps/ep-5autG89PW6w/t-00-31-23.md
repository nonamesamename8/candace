## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> When you purchase from Riverbend Ranch, you are not only supporting the 64 cowboys plus their families who work on those ranches, but you're also supporting over 260 other U.S. ranches and the hundreds of American families who work on them. It is born in the USA, raised in the USA, processed in the USA. Their meat is aged to perfection for 21 days and shipped directly from their ranch to your home. This is not your average black Angus beef. This is more flavorful, more tender, and even better than the best Angus beef that I've ever tasted. Right now, if you head over to riverbenderanch.com and use promo code Candace at checkout, you will get $20 off your first order. Trust me: you're going to be very impressed.
