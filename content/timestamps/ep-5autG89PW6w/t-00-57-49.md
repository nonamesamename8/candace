## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Glad I held it together reading that letter. First comment that we have is from Jennifer. Jennifer writes: "Do we know anything about the security team that was supposed to keep Charlie (Charlie Kirk) alive?" I do. I have everybody's names—the people that we couldn't identify. Jennifer continues: "So many questions. Since the MO was out there due to Trump (Donald Trump), why wasn't this taken into consideration? Were drones offered and/or declined? Did they do a drill run-through that morning?" Amir Odom—hey, what's up? Thank you. He has a great YouTube channel: Amir Odom. He writes: "Before we judge Candace for thinking that there's hidden agendas, we have to admit history has given her every reason to." Absolutely. There are. Politics is a nasty business, Amir.
