## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a close friend of mine, as you know. We actually spoke literally the night before his tragic and untimely death. I was on a small Zoom call with him and a couple others. We were literally talking through this topic. I was giving Charlie (Charlie Kirk) advice for how to message on this issue on his forthcoming campus tour. He kind of jokingly mentioned to me—he was like, 'Josh, I'm going to mention your book, Israel and Civilization, and it's so good.' And that was literally our last conversation. It's just so tragic. This letter that he wrote to the prime minister, Chris—I read back in June or July or so. And there were so many people in the aftermath of his horrific assassination—Candace Owens, folks like that—who were saying that, oh, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was turning on Israel.
