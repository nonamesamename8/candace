## Transcript

**Andrew Kolvet:**
> But I want to take the start of this show to address some of the things that have been going around on public—namely about a group text chain that has been made known and released by Candace Owens. And I just want to address it head-on because that was a text grab, a screen grab that I had shared with people, so it is authentic. And I want to go into it because actually—and really excited that the truth is out there. I first want to say the reason I didn't share that screen grab publicly is because it was a private—it was a private exchange, and I felt like it didn't necessarily comport with things that were already public. I wanted to not betray my friend's trust in that way.
