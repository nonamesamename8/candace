## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> First off, I'm not even inclined towards tech, but also would have to be an absolute moron to try to figure out how to manufacture text messages for the purpose of releasing them to then probably get sued by every person that was not in the chat. Like I'm just like, "Hey, Josh Hammer received this message." That'd be so dumb. But like I said, these people were desperate for it not to be real because they've been lying so hard about everything. They've just been lying, and they have some egg on their face now. And reality hit them pretty quickly this morning when Andrew Kolvet, Turning Point's spokesperson, confirmed that the messages were in fact real. He did this on the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) show.
