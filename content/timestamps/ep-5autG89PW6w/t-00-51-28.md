## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Many of these people are existing and potential future donors. We know many of them. Ethical people will not stand for lies or injustice—either privately or publicly. The existing and future donors who were friends of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s and those he loved deserve no less. But please spare us the absurd and evil suppression of suggesting that Candace should not be doing exactly what she is doing. She is doing no more and no less than what her friend Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have done for her. Her actions are far more reasonable and explicable than an assassin's bullet to the throat. Consider for a moment the evil of possibly allowing the conviction of a potentially innocent party with the death penalty.
