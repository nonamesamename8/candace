## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Well, apparently George Zinn had to receive medical treatment following that little fracas. And he told multiple nurses and doctors that he did it because he was being paid to do it. He said he had not been paid yet, but he was going to receive payment. He didn't know from whom. That's interesting. Decoy Boy told medical staff apparently he was just singing—just telling everybody who would listen—that he did it because payment was going to be promised to him if he did do it. What does that tell us? We should definitely dig into George Zinn.
