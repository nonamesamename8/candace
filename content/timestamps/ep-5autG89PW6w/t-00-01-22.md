## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All the siblings are fighting one another to see who will it be? Who will it be that gets this empire? That really made me chuckle. I think that should be our new show intro. Yes, yes, yes. Who will succeed Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Who shall inherit the Turning Point throne? You know what, you guys? The best part of all of this for me is unlike those ill-begotten heirs on the show, I have 0% interest in Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s empire. I'm not motivated by the idea of carrying on his torch.
