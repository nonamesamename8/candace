## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> In fact, my suspicion is that that photo was not even shot on the same day. I do not believe that the person who ran across the Losey rooftop killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). I think it was another decoy. I do not believe that shot came from a Losey center at all. And obviously we all know that decoy George Zinn didn't kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And I received an interesting tip about him as well: that he's much more connected than what meets the surface. He potentially has connections to the federal government—familial connections to the federal government—and we are prodding that. It's getting interesting.
