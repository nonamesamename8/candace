**SPEAKER_1:**
> You have seen those red light panels that are trendy, but this is totally different. It's the Glow Infrared Therapy Light from SaunaSpace. It helps with screen fatigue. It's amazing for your skin. In the morning, it's like natural sunlight. It's warm, comforting. It resets your body clock. And at night, it'll help you relax and get ready for a seriously deep sleep. You can even use it as pain relief on sore muscles or cramps. And the real game changer is their Firelight Sauna because it's portable and powerful. You're getting red light therapy and an infrared sauna all in one. It's your personal wellness sanctuary—plus it's all handmade here in the USA with pure organic materials with zero EMFs for the ultimate detox. SaunaSpace spent over a decade perfecting their Firelight spectrum, and thousands of studies support the benefits.
