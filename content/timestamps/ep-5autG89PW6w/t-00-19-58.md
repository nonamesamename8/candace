## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> There is an underground movement of knights all around the world—from mom sleuths to government employees, like he said, to personal assistants, to Turning Point USA donors—who are working together to bring justice to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) because we don't like the way this feels. We just don't like the way it feels. The vibes are off. I will respect—even though obviously that statement was prepared—I will respect the fact that Andrew says what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have said. And for the first time, I feel that's been expressed: that we have to let free speech be our North Star. And I'm not so sure that the people—some of the people that are donating to Turning Point USA—believe that. In fact, I'm certain some of them don't believe that. Obviously, we wouldn't have that text message if they all believed that.
