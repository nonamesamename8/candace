## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anyway, that would suggest that there are thus—for a total of four decoys—like George Zinn, Staircase Guy, Maroon Shirt Guy, and Losey Center Guy, none of which I believe actually pulled the trigger. Call it a hunch. I think it's much more likely that Lance Twigg is the one that is walking in that maroon shirt. His build is nothing like Tyler Robinson's build. Lance Twigg is thinner.
