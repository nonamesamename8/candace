## Transcript

> Anyway, that would suggest that there are thus—for a total of four decoys—like George Zinn, Staircase Guy, Maroon Shirt Guy, and Losey Center Guy, none of which I believe actually pulled the trigger. Call it a hunch. I think it's much more likely that Lance Twigg is the one that is walking in that maroon shirt. His build is nothing like Tyler Robinson's build. Lance Twigg is thinner. And obviously I'm speculating here, but I believe Tyler Robinson was involved, and he was in fact driving around campus on that day—therefore assisting in the costume changes, likely picking up clothing.
