## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Candace's investigation is about actually getting to the truth—whatever that truth is. If the current theory for the shooter is true, then okay. If that is a lie, then we need to know. Every episode of Candace's show since Charlie (Charlie Kirk) died—her heartfelt emotional tribute to her exceptional journalism—has been incredible, and anyone who cares for the truth and who wants to know who killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk) for real should watch every episode in its sequence. The fact is that we are being told—as his friends or simply as people who had never heard of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) before his assassination—simply does not make sense to the vast majority. It feels like gaslighting. It feels like we are being lied to. It is not hard to tell the truth to the public or to present the clear facts that illustrate the truth clearly. Many extremely ethical people helped to build Turning Point and all associated groups—Turning Point Action and Turning Point Faith.
