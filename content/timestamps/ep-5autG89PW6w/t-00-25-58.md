## Transcript

There will be no place that you can hide. Anyways, I want you guys to know that I was feeling so inspired by Josh Hammer's utter lack of human decency that I went ahead this week and sent around a life insurance policy of sorts—a package rather—to people that I trust: a package filled with text messages, emails, private communications, videos, and private legal documents.
