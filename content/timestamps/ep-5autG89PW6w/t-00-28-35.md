## Transcript

**Rob O'Neill:**
> I mean, it was off it right from the beginning for me. Do we not guard rooftops anymore? There's been assassinations, assassination attempts all over the world. Why aren't we looking at rooftops? And then when I was sent the video at the same message where they said Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was just shot— when I watched that horrific video—he was obviously dead before he hit the ground. But the questions immediately started to come to me. That was not an entry wound that we saw. We saw an exit wound. So where'd that bullet come from? You don't bleed like—and I've shot guys closer than the camera was— an entry wound doesn't look like that. An exit wound does. Why did his shirt move the way it did? When I've shot people, their shirts didn't move like that. And then the initial reaction was, "Well, he was obviously wearing body armor, and it was deflection."
