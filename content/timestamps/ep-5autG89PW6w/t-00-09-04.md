## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So this is the usual chatter, a group of people. She wrote, "Is Candace posting fake group chat screenshots to conveniently back up her narrative that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was dropping the pro-Israel cause and inviting Candace to the TPUSA stage?" "I'm just asking questions." All fair. We allow questions. We even allow diagnoses. We're chill. We're on the side of truth. We are so chill. Laura Loomer, who is legally just—you know—not allowed to own a gun because she's a literal lunatic, had the nerve to post this about me. When somebody called her out, Morgan Ariel said, "Laura Loomer hasn't made a single post about Candace Owens reporting on Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s group messages."
