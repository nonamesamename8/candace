## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I wanna remind you guys in the wake of all of this that it is so important to keep trusting our guts. We have been proven right so many times in the recent past, right? Whether we're speaking about COVID—people that had to actually take a stance before the government then suddenly admits: 'Oh yeah, we were lying. We were lying about this. We were lying about that." We feel it all right now. The feds are lying. That is beyond obvious, which is why I was very happy to hear former Navy SEAL Rob O'Neill explain this plainly when he went on Piers Morgan's show the other day. Let's take a listen to what he had to say. (Clip: Rob O'Neill)
