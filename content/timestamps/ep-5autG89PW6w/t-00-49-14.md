## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And America will have lost one of its greatest living patriots only to see those forces against which he fought and died for win. Candace's extremely valid point that hers has so far been one of the only public voices from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s closest friends questioning the absurdity of some of the communications regarding what happened and demanding clarity is well made. And frankly, that point alone is shocking to the world. We have been receiving calls from senior Republicans and from Turning Point donors who agree with her all last week, and they started up again this week. They agree with Candace, but seeing the attacks that she is experiencing, they are terrified to voice their views publicly. Is that really where we are in 2025? Few people following the matter believe the official version—the virgin version.
