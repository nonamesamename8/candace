I want to tell the truth, so there's that. Sarah D. writes: "Keep going, Candace. Love from Australia." Thank you, Sarah. Steve writes: "A major victory in defending Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s true legacy. We stand with you, Candace. The truth will come out. When it does, it will shake the foundations of the world."
