## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anyways, we were told by Lance's family—who, by the way, own the apartment that the two of them lived in—that Tyler and Lance lived in—we were told that somebody illegally changed their locks on the home following the raid. Obviously illegal. They were not informed that the locks were being changed. So it gives us two options: it was either Lance, or it was the feds. I was wondering: you know, if you're Lance and you really got swept up in this and you're so shocked that Tyler Robinson did this, are you speaking to your family about that? My gosh, I imagine you want to speak to your family. No, no—it seems Lance has similarly been in an unknown location since the raid.
