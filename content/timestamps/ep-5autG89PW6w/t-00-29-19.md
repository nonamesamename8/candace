## Transcript

**Rob O'Neill:**
> One, no, he wasn't wearing body armor. And two, it doesn't deflect like that off of body armor. Why was his shirt moving from right to left? Why were people being interviewed saying, "Yeah, they came from my left to right—from his right to left"—immediately shut down? And then did they tear the crime scene down immediately? Just right off the bat from seeing it—knowing he was dead—saying a lot of this is bad. Not even getting into the soliloquy of text messages that 22-year-olds don't send their trans lover. So immediately, the official story sounds like it needs to be investigated. But now the whole crime scene is gone. They paved over it. Nothing to see here.
