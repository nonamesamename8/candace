## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We can only begin to imagine the wrath of God and how upset Charlie (Charlie Kirk) will be if an innocent man were to be executed for his assassination and what ill fortune would befall a Christian country and the individuals that would allow this. In this sense, Christianity and a leading Christian democracy are now on trial. There's a special place in eternity reserved for those who would allow such an injustice. If Turning Point and those Charlie (Charlie Kirk) left in charge—if Turning Point and those who Charlie (Charlie Kirk) left in charge failed to stay true to the principles and purposes on which Charlie (Charlie Kirk) founded it and with which he and Candace originally breathed life into it during its formative years—then Turning Point will end up like MySpace.
