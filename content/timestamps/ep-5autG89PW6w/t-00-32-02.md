## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> This is something from Fatty15—the first emerging essential fatty acid to be discovered in more than 90 years. It's an incredible scientific breakthrough to support our long-term health, wellness, and our healthy aging. Based on over 100 studies, we know that C15 strengthens our cells and is a key healthy aging nutrient which helps slow biological aging at the cellular level. When our cells don't have enough C15, they become fragile, and they age faster. Thankfully, Fatty15 repairs age-related damage to cells, protects them from future breakdown, and activates pathways in the body that help regulate our sleep, cognitive health, and naturally repair our mechanisms. Fatty15 is a science-backed, award-winning, patented, 100% pure C15 supplement.
