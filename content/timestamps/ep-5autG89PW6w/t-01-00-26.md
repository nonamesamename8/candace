## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You know, it has also been great to feel the Orthodox and the Catholic energy rising. And I want to be clear: I'm not saying that as a potshot to other denominations. But it feels like there's been a lot of persecution, and a lot of this for some reason has involved—as I showed you yesterday—you know, pastors that have been a part of this, like part of spreading these lies. And that is—it's not good. It's just not good to have pastors using the Bible to lie. It's just not okay. Maheen Siddiqui writes: "I think it would be interesting to do a deep dive into how the term 'Judeo-Christian' came about. I'm aware of it. It seems to be a very convenient word for Israel." I don't think any of the core values or their views on Jesus are shared.
