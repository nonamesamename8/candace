## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> It will become just one more ineffective and rather dull has-been entity. I believe that God has other plans for Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and for his legacy. A cover-up of the truth is not—in my view—part of God's plans. I believe that people of goodwill from all over the world will ensure that. Keep going, Candace. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is walking with you every step of the way. He loves you deeply, and you are right about your friendship with him. Never at any time through all the challenges that the political arena and life brought did he ever withdraw his friendship from you, Candace. You were—you are an eternal cornerstone in his life and his legacy. What a great friend you are being to him. We're all witness to that. All of our love, John and Irina. Oh, it's gonna make me cry again. It's just—like I really needed it. I don't know. I just really needed it.
