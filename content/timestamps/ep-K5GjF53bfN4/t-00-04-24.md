## Transcript

**Xavier DeRusso:**
> And then people are taking things out of context, because there was like a, in the article, the hit piece that came out, it talks about how Charlie (Charlie Kirk) raised up his phone and had written on Twitter, and he said something like, "Benjamin Netanyahu (Israeli PM) needs to resign" or something like that. And he goes, "What would happen if I do this?" There was discourse, and then there was one woman who sat in the back who said, "If you do that, you're indirectly going to empower Hamas." And then Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was like, "See, you have to stop saying like that." He was saying that when you are debating about Israel, you need to stop doing it emotionally. You need to do it logically and factually, otherwise you lose the debate. He said it is moral blackmail if you say that somebody saying that a politician is bad, that you're then empowering a terrorist organization. Fair argument.
