## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> But then there arrived a moment when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) felt that the money was disappearing, allegedly, I'll say allegedly here, but I think we have some proof that shows that. And the excuses that he was being given for the money disappearing weren't adding up for Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Said another way, the math wasn't mathing, okay? He felt that, again, according to sources, that the company was burning through cash too quickly. And Charlie (Charlie Kirk) set about finding out why and how this was happening. So on September 2nd, which is, of course, just one week before he lost his life, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) surprised the company by announcing that he was putting together a DOGE department. Yes, a Department of Government Efficiency like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy had set out to do. Trump (Donald Trump) won. They got behind him, right?
