## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You know, men carry the weight of the world on their shoulders and they were following that. This was a faithful couple. This is a woman who consulted a priest and prayed when she felt that somebody had put a hex on her husband. And I just think everyone is being a little unfair by trying to assign so much ill will towards someone who hasn't done anything to warrant that, and I would have been the first person. If I felt that anything was there, I would have said something, truly in every capacity, and of course, I'm not in their marriage, but I know that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was very happy with Erika (Erika Kirk), and I know that Erika (Erika Kirk) was a reason she was pushing Charlie (Charlie Kirk), as women do, to really think through his ideas and think through what it was that he believed in one way or the other. By and large, I'm not going to sit and pretend that I had this relationship that I had with Charlie (Charlie Kirk), that I had with Erika (Erika Kirk), of course, because neither he or I were married when we were hitting the road together, but she made him happy. And I just want you guys to know that. And so when you're putting stuff out there, just imagine that you're in her shoes. Imagine the size and the scale of that company.
