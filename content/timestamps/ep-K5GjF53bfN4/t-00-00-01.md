## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> All right, you guys. So a week before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) lost his life, he expressed some concerns about the finances at Turning Point USA. In fact, he wanted to put together an entire department, a little mini-department, to address those concerns. And we have evidence of that. It is always the advice when investigating any crime to, quote-unquote, "follow the money." So let's do that just a little bit here. Plus, there is a video that has gone absolutely viral. I am sure you have seen it. It was emailed to me many times, where there is a theory that is being floated that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was shot from the back. Now, there are two aspects in that video that we can debunk, and I wanna do that. And there's one aspect that we cannot debunk clearly. I think this is a worldwide investigation.
