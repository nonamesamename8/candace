## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like, that doesn't feel real to me yet, but I know I will get to that stage eventually. James Moran writes, "Greetings from across the pond in Ireland, Candace (Candace Owens), and keep up the great work. God bless." Thank you, James (James Moran). Renee (Renee) writes, "Have you covered the Amazon listing from September 9th for a book about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) with all the details, which were pretty accurate, of what happened on the 10th?" I have a picture of a screenshot supposedly verified. Yeah, I think Amazon came out and said that it was a technical error because I guess you can adjust the dates. To be honest with you, I didn't look into it because there's a thousand ways that you could run with this, and I wanted to keep the pressure on the feds and I wanted to keep the pressure on getting as much information as I could about what took place on that day. But I know there are people that have made a lot of videos about that and so maybe I'll watch one of those. Brie Barrera (Brie Barrera) writes, "So glad that I caught you live today.
