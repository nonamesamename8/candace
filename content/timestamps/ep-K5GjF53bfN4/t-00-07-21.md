## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Like were there Hamas tunnels under the Hamptons? That doesn't—that doesn't make sense. That makes entirely no sense, and we should call out how little sense that makes, especially because one of the influencers did post on August 6 that she was in the Hamptons. Actually, Emily Loves America—Emily Saves America, pardon me—said, when she was fighting with somebody about how little their engagement ring was during this weekend, "How do you guys expect to have a house, land, and multiple kids?" "Be for real. Sorry, I'm MIA, I'm in the Hamptons." So are conservatives not allowed to be in the Hamptons? Is that getting slaughtered? Is it specifically conservative influencers? You said that it wasn't a pro-Israel event, so I guess there's no Israel angle here, which does—of course, there's tons of Zionists in the Hamptons, Ackman among them—so I don't understand.
