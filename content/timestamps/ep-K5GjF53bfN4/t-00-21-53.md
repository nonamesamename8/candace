## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Since joining TPUSA in 2020, Justin has led Turning Point's fundraising division and, in more recent years, has been involved in some organizational operations, filling the COO role in many ways, but now officially taking on the title and expanded responsibilities." Now we're gonna jump to that last big paragraph. "In this role, I have empowered Justin, among other priorities, to engage in an organizational-wide DOGE effort. Justin will be assembling a small team to assist in this effort, which is focused on Turning Point USA, one, becoming more efficient, two, becoming more cost-effective, three, unifying organizational success around company-wide metrics and goals, and four, reshaping company culture. I expect many positive changes to come from this forthcoming initiative and Justin's expanded role.
