## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So I had been hunting down all the videos, all of the footage, and wanted to go back to ground zero, as we did yesterday, of the initial videos that went viral on social media and on X on the day that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. And it occurred to me that I forgot about one video, actually the only video that exists of the shooter sprinting across the rooftop mere seconds after the shot was fired. Now, you probably recall that video in the back of your mind. You remember that video that was going viral with him seen running across the roof. Well, I'm about to show it to you in a much clearer quality than you have ever seen it, a higher quality than you have ever seen that video. Remember, before I show it to you, to tee this up, it is just a couple of seconds after the sound of a shot rang out. Let's watch this together. And kind of, and we're gonna just cover that.
