## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I believe that there are lies by omission, and I view them both to be liars, okay? And of course, who could forget the word length of Bill Ackman's reply. I tell you guys about this weekend in the Hamptons. I tell you about Benjamin Netanyahu (Israeli PM) calling Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and inviting him to Israel. And Bill Ackman replies with an essay. A college essay, 959 words to be precise, was his response to me speaking about that, where he himself did not actually address my point about the quote-unquote "intervention," which is how Charlie (Charlie Kirk) described it himself. And my point about Benjamin Netanyahu (Israeli PM) and the offer to take Turning Point to the next level financially, no one wants to address those points.
