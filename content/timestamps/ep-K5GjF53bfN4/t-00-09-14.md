## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I don't understand it. Every excuse that I have been handed for why they won't release it makes no sense to me. If you are under pressure, if people are starting to look at you funny as an organization, if they're thinking that, whether rightfully or wrongfully, if they are suspecting because they see this footage of someone quickly remove the SD cards that you guys had something to do with the assassination of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and you quite literally have footage that in theory should vindicate yourself, why wouldn't you release it? Think about that. It's just in your own capacity. If somebody is saying you are guilty of anything, they're like, "Candace (Candace Owens), you are absolutely guilty of breaking into my car." And I'm like, "I have a camera right here that shows that I did not break into your car." Would it make sense if I was like, "But I'm not gonna release that"? "I'm not gonna release that. Because it's not right.
