## Transcript

> And, you know, I'm not exactly a forensic accountant, but I know that other people, other journalists, got really interested in this angle, who were similarly receiving leaks, and have pushed this off to forensic accountants, and some of the stuff is getting very interesting. I did want to show you guys this because I think this proves what we have been hearing. It's at least a starting point, an insider who said that they were there and present when Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had expressed some concerns about where the money was going. And leading up to that moment, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had by and large completely removed himself outside of the organ of fundraising, which is to say that it wasn't something that he necessarily had his finger on. Of course, he always would show up for top donor meetings. He is the face of the company. But in terms of the accounting specifics, he trusted his lieutenants. Of course, something that big, you're clearing $100 million a year, you gotta have lieutenants and you have to trust those lieutenants. And of course, sometimes those leaders don't like one another. That's all normal.
