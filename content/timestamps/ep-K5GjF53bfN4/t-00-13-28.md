## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It kind of looks like he's got something trailing behind him, too. Maybe that's the towel that we've been told about. We can play that again as you watch this. Now, let me tell you how I tracked down this footage. It took me all of two hours to track down this footage, to get the name of the person who had filmed the footage and to, from there, after messaging someone on Twitter, they said, "I got the footage from this person." This is the person that shot it, and he's willing to speak to you. I get in touch with this individual, okay, very quickly. This all transpired in a couple of hours, and you will never guess what it is that he told me.
