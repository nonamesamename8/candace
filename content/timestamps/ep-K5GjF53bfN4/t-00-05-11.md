## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Natasha Hausdorff was there, Seth Dillon was there, and Seth Dillon was the one that was applying pressure to him, and Seth Dillon and Josh Hammer—Josh Hammer didn't jump on him in that moment—were not happy. They were not happy with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) at the end of this weekend in the Hamptons because, again, they saw which way the wind was traveling in terms of his positions on Benjamin Netanyahu (Israeli PM) and Israel. And they were, in fact, being accusatory. And then you have the people who are trying to go and say that, oh, then why was the meeting so secretive?
