## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, first and foremost, the reason why I said, and I meant it genuinely, was to pray for Erika (Erika Kirk) a couple of days ago, and I said she is stepping into a role: a CEO and the chairman of a company, a company that got bigger than Charlie (Charlie Kirk) by everything that I am understanding, and just having been there, I saw it happening. And a company that she's going to have to learn in four seconds how this whole thing is, where it is a machine, okay? Those emails that you saw or checked, that was not written by Erika (Erika Kirk). That will be an entire department. And these are emails, when you fundraise, I've had fundraising emails go out with my face and my name on them. They are not authored by Erika (Erika Kirk).

And I understand how people, when they are motivated by money, how they don't even think about these things.
