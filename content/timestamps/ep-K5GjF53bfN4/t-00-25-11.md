## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Also want to tell you guys about PDS Debt because the system is not broken. It's actually rigged. And if you're buried in debt, that's exactly how they want it. Big banks profit when you're desperate. Creditors win when you lose. You don't have to play their game. PDS Debt helps you take back control. They've helped hundreds of thousands break free from credit cards, loans, and high interest traps. It's your money, it's your future. It's time to fight for both. PDS Debt goes beyond the numbers to understand your unique financial situation and craft a personalized plan that is designed just for you. There is no minimum credit score that's required, which is great. They're here to help you save money, pay off your debt faster, and start putting money back where it belongs, which is obviously in your pocket.
