## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So what I can say, and I'm looking at my minute-to-minute text messages because I sent somebody there on the ground to get me pictures of that bush today, and I agree with you. In the smaller, in the photos that I'm looking at today, the bush, you can kind of see through it, and in the image that you have, granted, it is grainy, it doesn't seem like you can see through it, so I am interested in that, and I am prodding that narrative, and I will let you know what I come up with, anyways. Again, the point of me doing that was just to help further direct your theories. Everybody is coming out with ideas, and I think that's great. Until the feds answer our questions, until we see more footage of what took place that day, all of us need to stay on top of it because we all sense that something is very wrong and we are not getting the truth.
