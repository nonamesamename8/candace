## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> One more thing that I'd like to share with you guys, you will recall yesterday during the comment section, we got a tip. A young woman that said that that doorbell footage was intentionally presented to the public only partially. And that the reality is that there was more footage which showed the person that they alleged, Tyler Robinson, walking with a woman who they don't know who that is, and that he changes clothes. So I'm not sure if there was more footage on the side of the house. There's another angle. But there is allegedly footage of Tyler changing clothes and he is with an unidentified woman. What I will say is I have established connection with that individual and it's a solid lead and it's only going to get more interesting in terms of who is involved in that cover-up locally, like a Utah person involved in that cover-up, which is another piece of this puzzle that I find to be fascinating.
