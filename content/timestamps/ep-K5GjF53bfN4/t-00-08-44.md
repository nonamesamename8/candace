## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay. I don't like the fact that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was literally facing financial threats over his speech, the thing that mattered most to him, right? Fighting for free speech. Even if you disagreed with somebody, you know, you got to make sure that they have a right to express their viewpoints. And what happened to me a year earlier seemed to be happening to him one year later. Another thing that I really do not like, and it is bothering me and is eating at me, is the fact that Turning Point will not release the footage, okay?
