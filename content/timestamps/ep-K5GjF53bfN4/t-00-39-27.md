## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> A lie always has to sprint, and it's because it's fearful. It's very afraid, because people only have to hear the truth once to know that it is the truth. They have to hear the lie over and over. It begs repetition, a lie, but the truth doesn't care. And I am on the side of truth. So there's that. And also because my relationship with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was real, actually, a shout out to Taylor Lorenz (Taylor Lorenz). I obviously didn't watch what everybody else was saying about Charlie (Charlie Kirk) after his assassination because I was absolutely wrecked. It was a very tough week for me and I felt, I didn't even feel motivated to get out of bed. But Taylor Lorenz (Taylor Lorenz) said, she's like, "Why do I feel like Candace (Candace Owens) is the only one—" I think she said this on X. I don't know if we have that tweet. I didn't ask you to pull it, but like she did say, "Why do I feel like Candace (Candace Owens) is the only one that actually cared about Charlie (Charlie Kirk)?" And she's the only tribute, because, I mean, that's the reality of politics.
