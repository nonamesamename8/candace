## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That said, I also want to be clear that it doesn't mean that every single person that is continuing on in the organization is guilty of murder. I mean, I think we want answers, but we shouldn't be like, you know, "This person's definitely a murderer because they're not providing the answers." You know, I've been speaking and I've been seeing a lot of vitriol that's been thrown at Andrew Kolvet's (Andrew Kolvet) way because he is doing press. He is carrying on Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) show. He was already seated on Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) show. He was already there. And I was being genuine when I said, "He's under a lot of pressure." There's no question. He's the spokesperson for Turning Point USA. And he's grieving somebody that he knows and who was a very close, if not one of his best friends he saw every day doing the Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) show. And he's still got to deal with the same donors that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was dealing with.
