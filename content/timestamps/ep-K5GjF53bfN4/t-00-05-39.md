## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I've always had a friendly relationship with Xavier (Xavier DeRusso), but we should listen to Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) own words, which we have played multiple times, of what happened the day after this little weekend retreat where he vented to Megyn Kelly his frustrations with him being wrongly labeled anti-Semitic and how it was actually pushing him away, and it wasn't good for Israel. Then one of the big questions that we discovered, or that we asked, and something that we had discovered, was that this weekend was kept hush-hush, which is extraordinarily unusual for a Turning Point event. If you're gonna fly your influencers out, you want them to influence, obviously.
