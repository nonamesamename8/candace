## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I think Jewish Americans are ignorant on this topic too because that's how this was designed. That's how this whole like pro-Israel matrix was designed to keep us dumb. Just want to shout out before we go to some more sponsors that somebody just dropped $500 to say this comment, and it's hilarious. They wrote: "I can't with Josh Hammer's lip gloss. You go, queen." It is—yeah, it's not a good look. I don't think it's a good look, Josh. But I shouldn't say that because on top of the struggle session—or within the struggle session—that Seth Dillon was putting—actually was this on a separate show? Okay, it was not Piers Morgan, right, Skyler? Okay, listen to what Seth Dillon says about why Nick Fuentes is a terrible human.
