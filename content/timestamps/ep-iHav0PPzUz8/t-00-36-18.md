## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, okay—certainly you're free. You're free to criticize them. You know, I would say that for all the people—by the way—who are so upset that Candace (Candace Owens) and Nick Fuentes have become so huge—like honestly, dude, talking to guys like you—you have no one but yourself to blame for that. It's all over the Israel issue, man. And the reason why they got so much support behind them is because they were against this destruction of Gaza—which was just like the most just horrible, inexcusable, inexcusable thing ever. But— I mean, that's a fact. It was low-hanging morality. Hey, I'm against killing children. They tried to put all of us through: How dare you—punish your anti-Semite—for saying or not looking the other way because they're Palestinians. And I guess I'm supposed to think that their life is not worth as much as an Israeli life.
