## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anyways, I wanted to read this email that came in because yesterday in the Q&A section, somebody had asked: What do you think Charlie (Charlie Kirk) meant when he said he wanted you to be his David? And I took the obvious answer, which was to slay a Goliath, right? To slay the Goliath. And somebody wrote me this email and reminded me, of course, of the narrative beyond David slaying the Goliath: David and his unique friendship with Jonathan in the Bible. And I am going to read that email to you. Somebody wrote: "Candace (Candace Owens), David and Jonathan were biblical figures from the Bible who shared a deep and profound friendship—forming a covenant of mutual support. Jonathan was the son of King Saul, and David was a shepherd who became a great warrior and future king.
