## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Anyways, you guys, we are going to take a break and then put you through a Seth Dillon-level struggle session to explain to you that the best way to honor Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is to cancel Tucker (Tucker Carlson) or something. Anyways, we'll be right back. Jumping in here to tell you guys about PreBorn! You know I love them. I've watched so many people who I'm close to be vilified for standing up for the truth. I, of course, have dealt with that myself, but I have also seen something else, which is a lot of courage right now in this moment. I don't play defense anymore. I don't water down what I believe to be palatable because silence, I have learned, is not kindness. It's actually consent. And right now, the greatest silence is surrounding the topic of the lives that are ended before they even take their first breath.
