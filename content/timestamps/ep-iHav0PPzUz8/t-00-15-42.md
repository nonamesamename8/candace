## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I guess there's just no place from Egypt all the way to Utah that an Egyptian military plane can like get a tire changed. This is totally routine—nothing to see here. Well, I'm telling you that for a fact, that plane was carrying military subcontractors. And for a fact, they were dropped off in Provo, okay? And that they did not make it back to Cairo. They showed you—I showed you—the plane left. They left on September 10th. It then laid over in Wilmington, Delaware, and departed back for Cairo on the 11th.
