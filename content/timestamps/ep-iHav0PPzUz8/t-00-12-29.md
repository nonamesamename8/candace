## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I reported that even more curiously that Egyptian military plane had previously only ever been to the United States twice in that past year. And both times it was in the lead-up—in the weeks leading up to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. Okay, here is that plane. The tail number you can see here is SUBTT. And this is a screenshot again from FlightRadar.
