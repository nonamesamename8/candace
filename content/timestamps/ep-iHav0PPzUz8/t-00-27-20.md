## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Check it out at pplx.ai/Candace. Again, that's pplx.ai/Candace. Okay, I want to clarify one thing because Mark was mansplaining in my ear, and he is right. I want to make sure that I speak perfectly. When I said that the Egyptian flight in its past flights to America had landed on American air bases, I didn't mean they physically landed on American air bases. I meant that they landed in cities where there are Air Force bases. And the notable exception here is that Provo does not have an Air Force base. They have one in Salt Lake City, but they do not have one in Provo. So I hope that makes more sense there. Now let's switch gears. I can't wait to see what you guys dig up.
