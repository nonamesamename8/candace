## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You know, just nothing here between here and Egypt—just needed to, you know, put some fuel in the tank and then go home. Answer the questions that we are asking. I am telling you, I feel it—that this flight— if we learn more about it, if we can figure out who is on this manifest, there is going to be a lot of questions that are answered in terms of what happened on September 10th, okay? I'm not positive, but I have a pretty good gut feeling that the way that they behaved when I pointed out this flight—which is to lie and to explain nothing—means that they are scared and has them shook. And of course, it's in the Middle East. So I'm thinking there might've been some foreign involvement in Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination.
