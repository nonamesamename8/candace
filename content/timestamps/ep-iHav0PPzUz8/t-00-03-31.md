## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This is from FlightRadar—that dip. I should tell you, because there has been a lot of speculation about it online, that took place approximately 26 minutes after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. So that dip took place 26 minutes after. And then the plane went back home or back to the home base in El Paso. Now, it's possible—just to be fair here—that the plane was running a military training exercise that morning. Maybe they were training a new pilot on how to make a fake landing or something. I really don't know. But this flight path did indeed happen. We can confirm that.
