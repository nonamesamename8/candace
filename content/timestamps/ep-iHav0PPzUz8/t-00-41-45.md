## Transcript

**Erika Kirk:**
> "And he basically said, I don't appreciate being morally blackmailed. And, you know, and every time people would say that to him, he would dig his heels in. It's like, well, maybe Tucker's going to give two speeches now at AmFest." She's got the screenshots from an internal chat that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was doing with TPUSA. And right up there it says, "Just lost another huge Jewish donor—two million a year—because we won't cancel Tucker (Tucker Carlson)." And I'm thinking of inviting Candace (Candace Owens). Whoa! It brings me no pleasure to criticize Tucker (Tucker Carlson) as much as I have been doing. But he has become the leading tip of the spear of what can only be described as a cancerous force—threatening to engulf the entire American right.
