## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I actually haven't offered you that until this moment. I would be glad to dispel all the rumors and innuendo. If the feds are telling the airport to lie for some reason—there was one person who said they were supposed to land at Million Air FBO, but then suddenly they shifted to another FBO and things were weird. I would be happy to clear up everything for you in a way that makes sense. And it could genuinely be because the government is so inefficient. Major point that I wanna make here is that the biggest anomaly that has happened is this kind of foreign angle. Like right away, they just got out in front of it and were like, there's nothing to see here. And we discovered—and I broke the story—that there was actually a third plane, which I found to be quite odd.
