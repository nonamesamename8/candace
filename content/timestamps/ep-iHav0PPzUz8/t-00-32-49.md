## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They are literally people that were the Never Trump movement in 2015. None of them—they're just like, they're like, we've infiltrated MAGA, and now we're gonna tell you how to turn it into the losing movements that we all represented.

In fact, these people were all pro-DeSantis even when Trump (Donald Trump) was up against Ron DeSantis, okay? They were against Trump (Donald Trump). They have held the line in hating Trump (Donald Trump) forever. And now that Trump (Donald Trump) is inevitable—meaning he's in office and there's nothing they can do about it and he's not gonna be re-elected—they're pretending that they support Trump (Donald Trump) and that they're super MAGA by demanding that MAGA cancels Tucker (Tucker Carlson), who is adored and loved by the MAGA base, of course.
