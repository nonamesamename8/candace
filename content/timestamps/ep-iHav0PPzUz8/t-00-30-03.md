## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Yeah, I'm a 36-year-old adult, and I'm equipped to handle that. Not so fair for an 18-year-old kid to go through that. I've been clear about that, and that person should get a second chance to explain their story. So Tucker (Tucker Carlson) invited him on to have a conversation. And this has led to people insisting that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) gets canceled from all Turning Point future events. Now, why are they saying he should be canceled? Well, because it's so dangerous that he platformed Nick Fuentes, who has said terrible things online, and Nick Fuentes has been adversarial to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) didn't like Nick Fuentes. So why is Tucker (Tucker Carlson) speaking to him? Like that's their logic. I spoke to him. I don't like Nick Fuentes. I speak to people I don't like all the time, actually. It's a good thing to do.
