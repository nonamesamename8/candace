## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Candace Owens: Okay, we're doing all this in mountain time. Candace Owens: They dipped down to just 300 feet above ground over the Provo airport runway, and they made a loop. Candace Owens: I'm going to show you a screenshot here. This is from FlightRadar. Candace Owens: So you can see that loop. Candace Owens: And again, this is a military plane, a military-contracted plane. Candace Owens: And we know it's military because it's leaving from a military base. Candace Owens: Okay. Candace Owens: Really interesting thing happening there. Candace Owens: Mark, if you want to jump on right now, just to describe this for all the women that are listening to this podcast—what we're seeing here with that chart on the bottom. Candace Owens: Happy to provide some mansplaining. Candace Owens: So at the bottom, you can see the altitude and the airspeed of the plane.
