## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, we're doing all this in mountain time. They dipped down to just 300 feet above ground over the Provo airport runway, and they made a loop. I'm going to show you a screenshot here. This is from FlightRadar. So you can see that loop. And again, this is a military plane, a military-contracted plane. And we know it's military because it's leaving from a military base. Okay.

Happy to provide some mansplaining. So at the bottom, you can see the altitude and the airspeed of the plane.
