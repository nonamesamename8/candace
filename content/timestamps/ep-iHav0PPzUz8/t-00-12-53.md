## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, of course, when I pointed out that this foreign military plane arrived on September 4th—so six days before—into Provo, Utah, and departed six days later on September 10th, they ignored the huge substance of this, which is why is this Egyptian military plane here in the middle of Utah. Instead, they said, oh, she made a time zone mistake. Like as if I'm on FlightRadar every day, accustomed to reading the data here. Yeah, I thought that I was looking at mountain time—like local time—on FlightRadar. As Mark just explained, no, they do it according to universal time. Okay, big deal. Like actually big deal.
