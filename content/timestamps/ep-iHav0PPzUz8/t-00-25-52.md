## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line at the emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a simple cold. I just open my kit, reference a doctor-written guidebook for safe use, and get back to life. The kit is a lifesaver with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who had their kit ready in a time of need. So head to twc.health/Candace today and use code Candace at checkout to save $48. You can get it now before cold and flu season kicks into high gear. That's twc.health/Candace—code Candace for $48 off. Kits available to U.S. residents only, unfortunately. Telling you guys again, by the way, about the Comet AI browser because we spend so much time on the web. We're clicking around online, searching, scrolling, typing. There's so many tabs. It's a lot.
