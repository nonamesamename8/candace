## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Unlike a HELOC—which can have varied interest rates—the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment—giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing low mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started. There's no upfront or hidden fees. So call American Financing today and start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210 or visit americanfinancing.net/Owens—americanfinancing.net/Owens. And as always, I tell you guys about Nimi Skincare. They are my favorites because the beauty industry has been telling us for years that we need all of these complex formulas to achieve healthy skin, and that's just not true.
