## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Then I saw that the one random Twitter user that caught that mistake suddenly got boosted in the algorithm, and they made it a trending story. Like it was like, trending story: this has been debunked. And I was like, ah, I've been telling you guys for a while, the military runs X—like not Elon Musk, the military. These are military bots that you're seeing on X. But that was essentially the vibe. Egyptian military plane: don't look over here. We have debunked. It has nothing to do with Charlie (Charlie Kirk) conspiracy theory because she got the time zone wrong. It was actually the flight departed a couple of hours earlier than she said. Okay, you know me—that just makes me more curious. Anytime you see a Snopes-level debunking—as I like to term it—it means you're onto something.
