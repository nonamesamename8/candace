## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Do I believe that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) would have considered shutting down Tucker (Tucker Carlson) because he sat down with Nick Fuentes. It is so beyond the realm of possibility that it is sickening to watch them do this. It really shows you—for those of you that are in my book club—what I was talking about when we read that last book about how they do this after death. They fight for the person's legacy—even though they were the very same people who were harassing them: the very same people that were making Charlie (Charlie Kirk) ill with the threats, with the money—who were pressing him at the Hamptons. Seth Dillon, Josh Hammer on the text—hearing what he was going through, seeing what he was going through—will then say, oh, I proclaim myself in charge of that person's legacy.
