## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Actually, the argument I'd like to go with is that Seth Dillon is a liar—which is why two days before Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was killed, he was explicit in saying he was left with no choice but to leave the pro-Israel cause, which would mean he didn't die a Christian Zionist, right? Common sense: Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in his own words. And Seth Dillon, you're aware of this because you put him through two weeks before—the struggle session in the Hamptons. What was it—August 5th and 6th? Pressing him on the things that he said about Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) and Yahoo. He was hosting people to have that discussion. But, you know— I guess for some Zionists, you would say it was almost fortunate that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is no longer here to take that last step that you knew he was taking. You didn't want another Tucker (Tucker Carlson) or Candace (Candace Owens)—people who were very much in the pro-Israel camp and left it because we could not stand your immorality.
