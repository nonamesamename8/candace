## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Candace Owens: There were, as I am sure you are aware, some inexplicable flights that were happening that day. Candace Owens: And actually, they're not even inexplicable. Candace Owens: They could very easily be explained. Candace Owens: It's just that the feds are kind of declining to do so. Candace Owens: And we don't really have much information about those flights. Candace Owens: In particular, there was one flight Candace Owens: that had a—I would say—described as an interesting morning. Candace Owens: It was contracted by our military for whatever reason. This plane departed from the Biggs Army Airfield at 6:13 a.m. That's down in El Paso, Texas, right? Candace Owens: And despite the fact that they were heading to Montana, they decided to make an unusual dip at 9:16 a.m. Again, this is in Utah time.
