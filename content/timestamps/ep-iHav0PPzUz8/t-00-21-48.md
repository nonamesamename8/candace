## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> If he is interested in solving Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s murder, then Kash Patel would be working with everyone. Everyone across all departments would be locking arms and saying, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was a wonderful friend. He did everything he could to put this administration into power. In fact, Trump (Donald Trump) would be late-night tweeting, being like, I don't accept this narrative. Trump (Donald Trump) would be asking questions. His sons would be asking questions. Turning Point USA executives would be asking questions. But instead, Kash Patel is saying, don't ask questions. Everything that you're hearing is a conspiracy. Homie has really turned into Dr. Fauci.
