## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Yesterday at 1 p.m. Mountain Time, a private aircraft owned by one of our companies with the tail number N888KG departed the Provo Airport for Page, Arizona. Pursuant to a pre-scheduled flight plan, occupants at takeoff included two pilots and no passengers. That tail number arrived at Page, Arizona airport at approximately 1 p.m. Mountain Time. At 12:55 p.m. local time upon arrival, I, Derek Maxfield, boarded that plane along with seven additional passengers for the return trip to Provo. We departed at PGA Airport in Arizona at approximately 1:40 and arrived at PVU at approximately 3:15 p.m. Mountain Time.
