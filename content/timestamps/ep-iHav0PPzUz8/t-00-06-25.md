## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So obviously this couple, Derek and Shalane Maxfield, were feeling the heat, And they said that contrary to a lot of the online conspiracies that were taking shape, the plane was actually empty when it departed Provo en route to Arizona, where he and some of his friends were picked up, and they were turned home to Provo. Okay. Some people thought, did they pick up like Turning Point USA people? And return back. We don't know at all actually who was on that flight manifest. In theory, it's not really our business, but of course, given this high-profile assassination, it feels like everything should be our business.
