## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Oh, but nobody's doing any debunking here because I make sure always that I have solid proof of what I am saying before I say it. I feel that I have been presented with absolute solid proof from this individual who is in proximity to one of the individuals that was aboard this flight. I can now report to you that it is a fact that on 9/4, this was not some dropping by in Utah as they were trying to claim because the plane needed to be serviced. That's what they ran with. They ran with, this could have been a routine servicing.

## Claims Made

- [factual] that plane was carrying military subcontractors. And ... they were dropped off in Provo
  - *Follow-up:* Confirmation from tip source or flight manifests
