## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Candace Owens: They want us to stop noticing that there are so many issues in the story that they're trying to sell us. Candace Owens: And now they're up in arms demanding that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) gets canceled from all future Turning Point USA conferences. Candace Owens: And you're never going to guess how they're trying to spin this. Candace Owens: Well, you probably will guess. Candace Owens: It's anti-Semitism. Candace Owens: Welcome back to Candace (Candace Owens). Candace Owens: All right, so while I was away in Wyoming, I received a rather shocking tip.
