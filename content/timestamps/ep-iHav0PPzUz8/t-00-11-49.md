## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> She started going after people for defamation—not people that wasn't attacking them for the substance of the claim that you were born male because she was—but rather she goes after them like she's going after me for saying, oh, well, actually you're saying that I stole my sister's ID and that's a crime, so I'm gonna sue you for that. And then the media runs with it and says, oh, this has been debunked. Nothing is being debunked. And when they do that—when they focus on that—you know they're hiding something, okay? When they focus on something that's totally inconsequential, a minor mistake that you make, they're hiding something. So I reported that on the day of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination, an Egyptian Air Force plane took off from Provo, Utah airport.
