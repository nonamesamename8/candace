## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> They've never actually really been done on the topic of Tucker (Tucker Carlson) or myself, but this is exceptional.

I don't like Nick Fuentes, and truly not because of anything he said in the past, because how he treated me and my team and how he lied on me after it. So I actually am judging him based on my experience with him, okay? I don't really believe in cancel culture, and it was why I platformed him in the first place. He said something when he was 18 and went through the gamut that I went through—that Tucker's going through right now.
