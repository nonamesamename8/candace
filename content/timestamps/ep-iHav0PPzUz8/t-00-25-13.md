## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Also want to tell you guys about The Wellness Company because it's officially cold and flu season, which means it's also flu shot season. After everything that we've been through over the past five years, the number of people that are getting that flu shot is at a record low. Not to mention the fact that even according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective—whatever that means—at best. And that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is, of course, a much better way to stay healthy. So grab a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company. You wake up with a sore throat or you have a runny nose—you can address those symptoms immediately with a doctor-prescribed kit that contains ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, generic Tamiflu, a generic Z-Pak, and so much more. It's kind of like having an urgent care clinic in your own home.
