## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We could not stand your lies. And we could not possibly think that God's chosen people would allow it. God's chosen people don't lie. God's chosen people don't kill hundreds of thousands of people and then try to tell you that they're the victim because they're spending tons of money on Christian Zionists. And yes, it is absolutely a heresy to get up on stage and to lie about what is in the Bible—to try to use it to manipulate people and tell them that what's right here in the Bible is that they shouldn't follow Tucker (Tucker Carlson) or Candace (Candace Owens). And yes, I would deem you to be therefore a heretic. So I hope I'm clear about what I think you are—people of your ilk are—people that pretend to be Christians
