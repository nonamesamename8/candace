That's paleovalley.com/Candace—and don't forget to use promo code Candace at checkout. Reminding you guys about American Financing—as I always do—because the cost of everything is still out of control, and many of us are relying on credit cards to cover the essentials. Now, if that debt is piling up for you as well, you should of course know that you're not alone. Americans collectively owe over $1 trillion in credit card debt. Now, you might have considered reaching out to my friends at American Financing, but maybe hesitated because you don't want to give up your low mortgage rate. Well, there's good news now because they've created the Smart Equity Loan— which is a solution that is designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage.
