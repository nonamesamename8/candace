## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we need to act like it. That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love. For just $28—that is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion. $28 will help her see the life that's growing inside of her. It gives her the truth that our culture does not provide. So don't sit this one out. Don't wait for permission. Be bold. Be clear. We should be unapologetically pro-life. Head to preborn.org/Candace right now. Give $28. You can also give 10 times that amount if you can. This is the line that I think that we must stand on. We have to stand for truth and what's right. We need to save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace to provide an ultrasound for just $28.
