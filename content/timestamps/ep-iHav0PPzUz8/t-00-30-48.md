## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> You should get out and speak to people who disagree with—people who you dislike. It's okay to dislike people. It's not okay to demand that other people be canceled for hosting them and having a conversation with them—or maybe liking the person. Maybe people want to listen to him. Anyways, this led to Josh Hammer—who is our resident psycho who really does look like that. Like this is not—that's not AI, okay? That's not AI. He wrote an op-ed in the Daily Mail—which they actually published—calling for Tucker (Tucker Carlson) to be neutralized. Yeah, this is him: the guy who mysteriously calls for public executions the night before, and then he always backtracks and goes, hey, hey, hey, that's not what I meant. That's not what I meant when I said that.
