## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You see it take off, goes to level flight, and then you see it dip down in the middle there. And that's what we're looking at. The time on there says 3:16 p.m., but that's UTC. That's just the general time for airplanes. So you go back minus six hours to give you Utah time. So that gives us 9:16 a.m. And then it goes back up and then continues to Montana. Okay, so it continued on to Kalispell, Montana, and then it lands for just under an hour before it again departs back for Texas once again on its return trip. It dips again to just over 300 feet over the Provo Airport runway. We're going to show you that again.
