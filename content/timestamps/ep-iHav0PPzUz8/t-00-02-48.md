## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Candace Owens: You see it take off, goes to level flight, and then you see it dip down in the middle there. Candace Owens: And that's what we're looking at. Candace Owens: The time on there says 3:16 p.m., but that's UTC. Candace Owens: That's just the general time for airplanes. Candace Owens: So you go back minus six hours to give you Utah time. Candace Owens: So that gives us 9:16 a.m. And then it goes back up and then continues to Montana. Candace Owens: Okay, so it continued on to Kalispell, Montana, and then it lands for just under an hour before it again departs back for Texas once again on its return trip. Candace Owens: It dips again to just over 300 feet over the Provo Airport runway. Candace Owens: We're going to show you that again.
