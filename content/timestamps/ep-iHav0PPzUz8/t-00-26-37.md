## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Well, this new AI web browser from Perplexity called Comet—that is absolutely changed the way that we're able to interact with our browser. If you use Comet, it feels like you kind of have a personal assistant that's living inside your web browser that can do so many things for you across the internet. And when I say do things, I mean—not just giving you answers—it can click, it can type, it can search, it can scroll. Let's say your friend is having a baby. The browser can search for you on the internet for the best gift for mom and the baby. It saves you time. Comet can shop, make reservations, book travel, summarize articles or videos, send emails, schedule meetings, and a lot more to make your life easier. So go and take back your time online. Download Perplexity's new web browser, Comet, and let it work for you—not the other way around.
