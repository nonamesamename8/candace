## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> But it does feel like you are drip-feeding us the information that you have about Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s death and the betrayals around him episode by episode. Are you unable to lay it out all at once for us? And what can be done about Kash's corruption?" Yes, I am obviously drip-feeding. That would—it would not be smart for me to tell them everything that I know because I am trying to figure out who the rats are on the ship. And that is why I've been intentionally setting bait—giving a little bit of information and allowing them to lie. That is just the smart way to go about this, obviously—because I know that there's rats on the ship. Some I know for certain, but if I out those people, then the other ones can protect themselves and distance themselves. I don't know everybody that is on the ship—and who has betrayed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). So this is the process that we are going through.
