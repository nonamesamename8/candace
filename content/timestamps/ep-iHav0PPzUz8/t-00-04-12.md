## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Candace Owens: And it has been accurately reported that the plane is owned by a certain LSAI LLC—L-A-S-A-I L-L-C—regarding which there haven't been any more details provided because this has not exactly been the most transparent administration, as they claim they were going to be. Candace Owens: The second mysterious flight, which was well reported on at the time—I would say this was the most reported-upon flight again by the public and which eventually created so much pressure that it warranted a response from one of the owners of the plane, who was Derek Maxfield. Candace Owens: He's married to Shalane Maxfield. Candace Owens: The two of them—they're a billionaire couple Candace Owens: from Utah. They run—now they run—a human sex trafficking charity.
