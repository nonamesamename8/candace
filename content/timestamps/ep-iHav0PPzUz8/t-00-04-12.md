## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And it has been accurately reported that the plane is owned by a certain LSAI LLC—L-A-S-A-I L-L-C—regarding which there haven't been any more details provided because this has not exactly been the most transparent administration, as they claim they were going to be. The second mysterious flight, which was well reported on at the time—I would say this was the most reported-upon flight again by the public and which eventually created so much pressure that it warranted a response from one of the owners of the plane, who was Derek Maxfield. He's married to Shalane Maxfield. The two of them—they're a billionaire couple from Utah. They run—now they run—a human sex trafficking charity.
