## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> We'll get into that in a little bit, but first I want to let you watch this second clip of what Seth Dillon—who clearly does not have a soul after waiting to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)—clearly is trying to pretend that he's Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s friend and now trying to use Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s legacy by pretending that somehow Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is not a true friend to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) because Charlie (Charlie Kirk) didn't like Nick Fuentes and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) spoke to him. Watch this—truly. This is a psychological operation. These people are nutty. Take a listen.
