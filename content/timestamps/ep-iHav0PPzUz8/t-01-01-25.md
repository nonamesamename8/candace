## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> People are understanding that we are in a battle—spiritual battle—between goodness and evil. And like I said, I always want to remind you that the frequency of truth carries more power than a lie. And that's why they demand we shut up. That's why they demand cancellation. They demand that Tucker (Tucker Carlson) is not given a platform because he's telling the truth, and it's resonating with people. And he's giving people the courage—more people the courage—to tell the truth, right? They don't want Dave Smith platformed at Turning Point USA. Josh Hammer was angry after he got destroyed by Dave Smith on Turning Point USA stage. So he privately started the struggle session because he knew that when they were on stage—these students that were there—were impacted, and they wanted to follow Dave Smith. People know truth when they hear it, and they know lies when they see it.
