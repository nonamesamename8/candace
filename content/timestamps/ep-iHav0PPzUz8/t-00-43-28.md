## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Their bond was strong despite the fact that Saul became jealous of David's success—leading him to threaten David. Their bond—the friendship—began after David defeated Goliath and grew into an unlikely but profound friendship. The Bible describes Jonathan's loving David as quote, his own soul and forming a covenant with him. Jonathan's loyalty was so great that he gave David his robe, his armor, and other symbols of rank—an act that has been interpreted as a transfer of succession. Jonathan repeatedly protected David from his father, Saul—warning him of the king's intentions to kill him. After Jonathan's death, David grieved deeply for his friend.
