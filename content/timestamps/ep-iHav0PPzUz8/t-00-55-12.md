## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And by the way, what I don't know—which is kind of the big point of this—I don't know actually who pulled the trigger and killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk), right? And so there's kind of two running investigations: who betrayed Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I—by the way—make the argument that everyone is betraying him right now by not speaking out and telling the truth. I would say that, right? And then there's the other element of who actually killed Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Carrie Jean writes: "Charlie (Charlie Kirk) saw you as his David. And one Samuel: Jonathan loved David like his own soul, protected him, handed him the robe and sword of kingship. He died young—never seeing the throne. But David finished the fight—wield the sword, finished the fight." Love that. Thank you so much. I think you might have been the person that wrote me the email yesterday. I can't remember if it was Carrie.
