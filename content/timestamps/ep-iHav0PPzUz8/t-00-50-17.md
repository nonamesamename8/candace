## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys—telling you about Paleo Valley because something my team and I are always craving are their beef sticks—specifically the ones that they make with 100% grass-fed beef sourced from small-scale regenerative American farms. You can feel good about what you're eating and who exactly you're supporting. They've stripped out all the junk. There's no preservatives. There's no gluten, soy, sugar, dairy, or GMOs. Just clean, nutrient-dense fuel—the way that food was intended to be. So whether you're road tripping, working late, or running around with the kids, these sticks deliver high-protein energy without the crash. Whether you're keto, paleo, carnivore—it doesn't matter. Paleo Valley works with your lifestyle, not against it. They come in multiple bold flavors—including original, jalapeño, there's summer sausage, there's maple bacon, teriyaki—so there really is something for everyone. With over 55 million beef sticks sold, Paleo Valley is the trusted and proven—and backed by a 60-day money-back guarantee.
