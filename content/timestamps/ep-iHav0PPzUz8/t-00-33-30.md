## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, if you think I can't get any more ridiculous, you got to check out this very real tweet from the Stop Antisemitism hysterical account. That account awarded me last year the top antisemite of the year. Thank you for all of you who voted and made sure that I won that. They actually didn't give me any award, which feels pretty cheap to me. Please don't put me on your account for saying cheap. I'm sure that's not good. Anyways, Stop Antisemitism actually tweeted this: "CNN platforming Anna Kasparian. Turning Point USA refusing to cut Tucker (Tucker Carlson). This is how the Holocaust started. Jew hatred normalized."
