## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> And yes, it is absolutely a heresy to get up on stage and to lie about what is in the Bible—to try to use it to manipulate people and tell them that what's right here in the Bible is that they shouldn't follow Tucker (Tucker Carlson) or Candace (Candace Owens). And yes, I would deem you to be therefore a heretic. So I hope I'm clear about what I think you are—people of your ilk are—people that pretend to be Christians and make a ton of videos—some of them simply because they're paid to do so, some of them because they're in the military and these are their instructions—and manipulate people who are well-meaning and want to become close to God by telling them that they won't be saved unless they support this abomination in the Middle East.
