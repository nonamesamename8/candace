Also want to tell you guys about American Financing, because if you've been living on credit cards just to cover groceries, gas, and bills, you know those interest rates are brutal.

They have mortgage rates that are in the fives, and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their pocket and out of the hands of the credit card companies. Right now, American Financing is helping homeowners save an average of $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high-interest debt, with no upfront fees, no obligation, and just a 10-minute call to a salary-based mortgage consultant. And here's the kicker. If you start today, you could delay two mortgage payments, putting even more cash in your hands right away. So do not wait. Call American Financing now: 800-795-1210.
