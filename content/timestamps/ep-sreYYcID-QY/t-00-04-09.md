## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Well, the reason is because, according to locals, many of which have emailed me, any of the footage that they had, any footage that they found, they immediately sent over to the feds and the feds told them that they were not allowed to share it at all. Like there was some risk if you shared this at all, it's not going to be good for you. Like they are kind of being pressured by the feds not to share things publicly. And that's why I would say 9-10 is beginning to remind me of 9-11, right? The feds sweep through everything to make sure that they have all of the footage so that no one can question the narrative that they put out.
