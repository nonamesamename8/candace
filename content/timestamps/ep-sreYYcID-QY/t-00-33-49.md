## Transcript

**SPEAKER_9:**
> He encouraged me to make the case directly to the American people about how vital Israel is to U.S. national security. He told me, “The Holy Land is so important to my life; it pains me to see support for Israel slip away.” Now, if Charlie disagreed with a policy of mine or a decision here and there, not only did I not mind, I welcomed it. This is the essence of Charlie. This is the essence of a free country. It's exactly what Charlie stood for. And I knew that his suggestions always came from the heart, from his love for Israel and from his love for the Jewish people. A few weeks before his death, I spoke to Charlie.
