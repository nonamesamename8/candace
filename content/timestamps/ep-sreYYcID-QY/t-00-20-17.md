## Transcript

**Tiffany Barker:**
> It was horrific. There was one shot that rang out, and everybody instantly looked around and then fell to the ground. People saw Charlie (Charlie Kirk) instantly get shot in the neck, and everybody fell to the ground, and then people started running and got run over. And I was with my family. We had 16 of us there—so five adults and like 11 children—and we instantly got separated. We're trying to find everybody, and we had amazing good Samaritans that grabbed kids. One took my niece and took her to her apartment. Somebody grabbed these two and my daughter and took them over to the tennis courts and stayed with them until I came. It was a super awful tragedy, and there were really good people that stood up and supported each other, and it was actually really powerful to see that.
