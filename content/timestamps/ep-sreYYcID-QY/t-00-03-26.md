## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> "I had to leave it," referring to the rifle, "in a bush where I changed outfits." Wait, changed outfits. Somebody commented, "Men don't say outfits." That's a woman thing. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's true. I would say I changed my outfit. A man does not say, "You just say you changed clothes." You would not say an outfit. Outfit is very girly. Okay, so is this AI or is this a female Fed that put these messages together? We're not feeling like it's Tyler Robinson. That's for sure. Now, another question we ask is: if there is this much available footage, why not, to relieve everybody, to make us feel like this is not a federal operation, why not just release anything to the public?
