## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Bull. But Charlie (Charlie Kirk), I am under so much fire right now. Do not even... I'm like radioactive. I don't even worry about the conference. I have to rebuild my whole life. I have to figure out how to get my podcast back on the road. I literally... I'm banned from Australia because I still have designers. Like, I have so much going on. For me not to speak at Amfest is nothing. Like, that doesn't even mean anything. Save yourself. Okay? It means nothing to me. Tell them whatever you need to tell them. And I'm going to focus on trying to rebuild my life, because they also had me canceled from YouTube.
