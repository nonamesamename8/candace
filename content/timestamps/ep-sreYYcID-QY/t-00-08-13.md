## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It would make much more sense if he had just changed his T-shirts. And like I said yesterday, if you were going to change at all, why did you have to leave campus to do that? And shouldn't the cameras have caught you either way? You take a totally different route. Again, there's cameras everywhere. So we can now plot this change, this alleged Dairy Queen stop, onto our timeline. Right? We can see that right there. We were very accurate when we started getting really serious about looking at a timeline. I like a clean timeline. We said the first correspondence that allegedly took place between these two had to have taken place between Tyler (Tyler Robinson) and Lance after six o'clock p.m. Well, there we go. 6:38 p.m.
