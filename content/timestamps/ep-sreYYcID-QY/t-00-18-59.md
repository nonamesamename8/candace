## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

I don't... just putting that out there, but let's move on. Because there are going to be two more Steeles, this time minor children. We do know, according to the indictment, that there were children that witnessed, that were there for the shooting. And these children—like I said—are going to provide an eyewitness testimony to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s shooting, and they are with their aunt Tiffany. And they say that they saw what happened up close, and I believe you're going to hear them say that they were a family of 16.
