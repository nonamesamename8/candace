## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Again, we are in full theory zone. I'm telling you what I'm hearing from locals. This is not Candace Owens' theory, but this would make more sense to me: that these were just guys that said, "Okay, if we found something weird on your camera or, wait, on your laptop, here's what you're gonna have to do to get out of this." Maybe they're being blackmailed or threatened, or “you're gonna go to prison for a very long time.” “What you're gonna do is you're gonna take this weapon, and you're gonna walk this weapon, and you're gonna leave this weapon right here, okay? And that's it. Then you're gonna busy yourself elsewhere around, and we will tell you what to do next.” That's their theory about Tyler Robinson. Okay? And that then the real shooter is an entirely different person who actually went into what they would describe to be a safe house of sorts.
