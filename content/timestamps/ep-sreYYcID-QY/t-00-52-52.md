## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> We don't know—no—but we know, so do not stop asking questions. Yeah, there is a reason they're doing this. They want, like, “Oh, just not until... Not until there's this memorial thing in Arizona,” which is not a funeral; it's a memorial event. That is, by the way, in large part—from what I understand—being controlled by the White House. Donald Trump (Donald Trump) is controlled by Zionists, so they're baiting me here. Why would I be invited by anyone in Donald Trump's (Donald Trump) Zionist administration, as I am speaking about a topic—as I am speaking? It's common sense. They're not going to allow me to share the stage, right? This is what... was it Michael Malice? Am I getting the name right? When he was going on his rant—if you watch the rest of it—when he says something's not right, he says people who are close to Donald Trump (Donald Trump) in the first administration cannot get close to him. He's like surrounded at this moment. Michael Savage—pardon. And he's telling the truth, okay?
