## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Seems like a good guy. I have no beef with him. Immediately, actually, I was wondering why were we ever told that it was doorbell cam footage? Obviously it was not doorbell cam footage. It's too high. Hence the height of the footage in general. Secondly, like I said, this clip is from the morning after Charlie Kirk's assassination. So TMZ had already publicized that footage. And so that strikes me as a little odd. That would stipulate that either the feds—like I said—collected that footage the night before and then immediately gave it to TMZ, or this guy himself gave it to TMZ before he gave it to the feds. So we're looking into Erwin, and we find that he doesn't just co-own just that one house on the street with somebody else named Samuel Steele, but Samuel and his wife Carrie are the ones that own the house that gave the footage, not Erwin.

## Claims Made
