## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> When Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated, I didn't feel compelled to come out and make two videos to tell people that I didn't kill him. That would be weird. Like, you would be like, "Candace (Candace Owens), that's very strange. Why do you feel like you need to say that?" If Tucker (Tucker Carlson) had to make two videos saying “I didn't kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk),” you would go, "That's weird." Megyn Kelly, “I didn't kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk).” Why would she do that? Of course she didn't kill Charlie (Charlie Kirk). But Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi) has come out—like I said—with his second statement, and we can listen to it. Take a listen.
