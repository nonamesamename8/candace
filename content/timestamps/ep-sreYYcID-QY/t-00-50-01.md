## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The FBI has been warning homeowners about a type of real estate fraud that's on the rise, which is title theft. This type of theft does not happen by breaking down your doors and stealing your stuff. It happens with a one-page document with a forged signature that gets filed at the county. If your title—that's the legal record of ownership—gets transferred out of your name, criminals are using your ownership to drain your equity or even sell your property. And you won't even know about it until you start getting collection or foreclosure notices in the mail. That's why I've partnered with Home Title Lock so that you can protect your equity and find out today if you're already a victim. You can use my promo code Candice at hometitlelock.com and you'll get a free title history report and a free trial of their million-dollar Triple Lock protection, which is 24/7 monitoring of your title records, urgent alerts to any changes, and if fraud occurs, their U.S.-based restoration team will spend up to $1 million to fix it.
