## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> A source tells me that they saw him dropping... well, near this Dairy Queen, that there's a cemetery, and he was dropping clothes into that cemetery. Now, we have not gotten anything from the feds about where the clothing was dropped off, where he changed, nothing. My question then is, what is going on? My suspicion, I maintain, is that there are multiple people that are involved. And after receiving this, that suspicion is growing, okay? Like I said, unless that man is a cold-blooded killer. He just seems to be a la-di-da, eating some Dairy Queen, and it's not making sense.
