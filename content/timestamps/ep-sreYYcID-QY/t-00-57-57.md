## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I saw you guys, like, you know, the PBD chat going crazy. Thank you for that. I don't know how they just allowed him to lie like that. It's such an easy thing that could have been debunked. But I'm built for this. Like, you get built different when you watch someone who you know very well, who you were very close to, who you built with, someone who was beside you when you were nobody, he was nobody. When you watch that person catch a bullet, you really start to comprehend the evil of this world, the evil that we are fighting, and we are only going to conquer this evil through truth. That's it. We got to wake up everybody's eyes at the exact same time. Khalid Mohammed writes, good luck with everything. Thank you. Cynthia Martinez writes, Candice, you are divinely protected.
