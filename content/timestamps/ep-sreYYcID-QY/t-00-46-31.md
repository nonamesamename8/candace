## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I guess you were born a boy—a male is what I should say. You were born a male, and you've never sued anybody for making that statement. You sue for things around it. You're suing me because you're saying, "Well, you said I stole the identity from my sister." I'm not a thief. You've never sued anybody for the claim that you were born male. So I don't know what this is—just like, we're just gonna all howl at Candace (Candace Owens) to try to distract her from looking into Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s murder and assassination. But it's focusing me more because this is not normal. Like, the amount of lying that's happening right now is because you don't think I'm strong enough to handle it, and you're trying to break me. You're not gonna break me, okay?
