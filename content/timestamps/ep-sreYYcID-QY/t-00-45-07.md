## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> No, actually, I didn't attend a vigil. And nope, you're right. You got me. I was not invited to speak alongside President Donald Trump (Donald Trump) and JD Vance on the stage with Tucker (Tucker Carlson) at a memorial event. What does this have to do with anything? The answer is it has to do with nothing. They're working on a narrative like they always do. They're coming in; they're squeezing; and they're trying to pretend that Charlie Kirk and I didn't speak for years. It could not be further from the truth. Okay? Charlie Kirk and I never—for a single second—stopped being friends. Ever. Never happened. They can't produce one shred of evidence to that effect. Nope. Just donors. And the donors at Turning Point need to be investigated. Because what I'm hearing—like I said—from Turning Point sources is not good.
