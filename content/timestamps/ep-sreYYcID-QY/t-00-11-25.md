## Transcript

> Let me just say this right away, as a rule: when a tragedy happens, I don't love the people who have the instinct to immediately speak to the press after a tragedy. What I mean to say is that, imagine you—you're on campus somewhere—a shooting happens, students are screaming, they're running, somebody is dead. I feel that a normal person's instinct is to make sure their loved ones are okay in their immediate vicinity, make sure they are okay—obviously—and then to call and alert everyone who would be concerned that you're okay, right? Maybe your mom—like you're gonna get on the phone first with, like, your mom and dad. You're not gonna get on the phone with TMZ. You're not gonna get in the... you're not gonna speak to the press first. I don't think so.
