Also telling you guys about Field of Greens because, look, I knew we all have two ages: our actual age, and then there's our body's internal biological age. What I didn't know is I've likely lowered my biological age without even knowing. And here's the thing: it's because Americans eat so many processed foods and not enough fruits and vegetables. Many people, perhaps most, are 10-plus years older on the inside than their actual age. A major university study suggests how to slow down aging. Participants slowed their aging by drinking Field of Greens. That's all they did. They didn't change their eating, drinking, or their exercise.
