## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Wouldn't you have just said, "I changed my T-shirt," if that's the reality? You just changed your T-shirt and that was enough? Was it just a T-shirt that he changed? The outfit, again—as I sensed yesterday—has always been problematic. I feel the outfit was the Fed mistake. It never made any sense to say that he wore an outfit onto campus—light khaki shorts and a maroon shirt—and then decided to completely change hours later. Because why wouldn't you just change the T-shirt? That actually makes more sense. Every kid wears blue jeans. You don't have to, like, change blue jeans or change out of khaki shorts to avoid detection. Cops are not going to go, "Hey, we're stopping you because you're wearing blue jeans." That's not a thing.
