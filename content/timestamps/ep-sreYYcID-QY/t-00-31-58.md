## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Tucker (Tucker Carlson) never said that. Megyn Kelly never said that. Dave Smith never said that. Instead what we are doing is we are disputing Benjamin Netanyahu's (Bibi) narrative that him and Charlie Kirk were on great terms and really friendly, and he had just invited him out, and here's this love letter Charlie wrote. He heavily implied that, and he was saying way too much too fast and too soon. That didn't feel right, and we just wanted the truth to be out there. I don't know who specifically came out and said that Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi) killed Charlie Kirk, but now that he's—for the second time—denying that he is, people are going, "What's actually going on here?" This is weird.
