## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> There's no images that we can see that have been released of his Dodge Challenger that's supposed to be idling nearby the campus for a very long time, right? As he texted these Fed messages—him and Lance are texting, and he's telling him every second, minute by minute, what he's done—and he mentions that the cops have done a sweep, remember? Tyler is supposed to be babysitting the gun in that moment, waiting for the right moment to go back and, quote-unquote, retrieve his weapon. But he sees a—and I'm not kidding—quote-unquote, squad car. That's what he writes, right?

## Claims Made

- [factual] He writes, "I can get close to it, but there is a squad car parked right by it."
  - *Follow-up:* Verify against released text messages from Tyler Robinson
