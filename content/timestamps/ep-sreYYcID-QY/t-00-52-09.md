## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The fact that Brigitte is suing, this is what they do. Like I said, it's just what they do. You know, they've got people in their back pocket, lawyers, corrupt lawyers doing their bidding. I mean, they created the system and then they mock us for participating in the system. Like I told you, Bill Ackman at this Hamptons retreat, according to one of the attendees, told them that they shouldn't even aspire to own a home and they should just give money to stocks. Like, okay, I'm sure you own no homes. They just want to turn us all into slaves. Like truly, that's what I believe about the billionaire class, what they actually want out of us, which is just for us to work forever and to own absolutely nothing. Krista Young, thank you for the donation. Candice, something is not right, Krista writes. You are going to uncover the truth. They messed up and we are here for it.
