> They are all parroting the same talking point. They're clearly collaborating. I can tell you it's a Zionist attack. I just—I've lived through enough of them. This is what they're like. And they all kind of say the same thing, slightly different. And the idea is to pile up and hope that if people keep seeing the same thing, they'll just believe it's true. And of course, Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi), defending Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi), seems to be at the center of it all. That Zionists control a lot of publications in America. That is just a reality. We can even go through that. It's a little weird that I have never said—throughout discussing this case, which I care very much about—that Benjamin Netanyahu (Bibi) murdered Charlie Kirk. Tucker (Tucker Carlson) never said that.
