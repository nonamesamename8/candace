## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> He writes, "I can get close to it, but there is a squad car parked right by it." Squad car. Okay, yeah, no. How many times do you call a police car a squad car? Do you want to know who calls it a squad car? Someone on the squad. Well, that's how that works. Yeah, but that's what Tyler writes: squad car. Elsewhere in this correspondence, and by the way, thanks to one of you people who commented on yesterday's episode and pointed this out to me. But elsewhere, Tyler says something that only a woman would say. That's why it didn't flag me as weird when I was reading this; it didn't flag me as odd. He says to Lance, allegedly, quote, "I worry about prints."

## Claims Made

- [factual] He says to Lance, allegedly, quote, "I worry about prints." "I had to leave it," referring to the rifle, "in a bush where I changed outfits."
