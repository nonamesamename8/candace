**SPEAKER_1:**
> Christ is King indeed. Christ is truth, and truth is King because it is Christ. Cajun Pinay writes, "Praying for you and your family. Stay safe and keep on, warrior." Thank you so much for this donation. Brittany Watson writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), you are like a crime-fighting superhero, solving all of the world's political crimes through investigative journalism. I believe you will be vindicated and proven right about the Macrons." Yeah, I've been telling the truth about that too. They better enjoy this break. Thank you for all of your hard work.

You know, you're lying; you've been lying; your whole political existence is a lie, and this all needs to be revealed, and everything needs to come down. Jasmine writes, "Get justice for our brother in Christ. We are with you, and we are listening. God is with you and your family. Keep going."
