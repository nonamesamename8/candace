## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> If they had found a .30-06 bullet, Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) death certificate certainly would have reflected that. In suicide situations—that's just one example; medical examiners, feel free to chime in— I've spoken to quite a few, but when the gun and the bullet are known, they are reflected onto the death certificate, okay? There is not one reflected onto Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) death certificate because they did not recover a bullet from a .30-06. Hunters and military men, rejoice. It turns out that common sense still rules the roost, okay? You guys were right. You were absolutely right. And this is why I hate politics because it requires us to submit to the idea
