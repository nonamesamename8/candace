They make the beef sticks with 100% grass-fed beef sourced from small-scale regenerative American farms, so you can feel good about what you're eating and what you're supporting. They've stripped out all the junk, so there's no preservatives, gluten, soy, artificial sugar, dairy, or GMOs—just clean, nutrient-dense fuel the way that food was intended to be. So whether you're road-tripping, working late, or running around with the kids, these sticks deliver high-protein energy without the crash. Whether you're keto, paleo, carnivore—it doesn't matter. Paleo Valley will work with your lifestyle, not against it. They come in a multitude of bold flavors, including original, jalapeño, summer sausage, maple bacon, and teriyaki.
