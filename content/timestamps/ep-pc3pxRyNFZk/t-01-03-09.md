## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Book club gets—you know—we go there. We go there, for sure. But it's fun; it's very chill, and you know that people are ready because they've read the book, so you're kind of able to push a little bit faster, I would say, on getting people to recognize just how evil things can get. And that's why I say read The Assault on Truth, confront that, and then everything will start to make sense. Because then you're going to go, "How the hell have our public school systems across the world been telling us that Sigmund Freud was like a wonderful man?" Like insane. Brittany Schofield, lastly. She writes, "I'm a stay-at-home mom, and I homeschool our six children." "I am so glad to see that you started homeschooling your children." "We don't live a fancy lifestyle." "My husband has to work his butt off, but it is so worth it."
