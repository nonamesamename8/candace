## Transcript

**SPEAKER_3:**
> Cooper Brown was an event volunteer who was just feet away from Charlie (Charlie Kirk) when he got shot. Cooper, what happened? Yeah, so this requires a little bit of background knowledge. So I work for an organization called Leadership Institute. And what we do is we work hand-in-hand with all the different conservative coalition groups on college campuses: the Young Americans for Liberty, the Students for Life, and the Turning Point USAs. And so at Utah Valley, we had been really, really excited to be able to host Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) this semester.
