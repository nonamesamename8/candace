## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm also looking forward to processing a lot of the information that is coming to me and researching more. The place that we should start on today's show is with, well, I first and foremost have to tell you right at the top, I can't tell you exactly who the information came from or which parties were involved in giving me this information because I don't want to get anybody in trouble. But I can say that I have positively verified something about the injury that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) sustained to his neck that I think is going to go a very long way in terms of helping those of us who have been sleuthing, those of us who want answers, those of us who are dedicating our time to this, because what we are being told by the authorities beggars belief, as John and Irina Matlin said. It just simply beggars belief.
