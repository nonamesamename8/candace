## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He doesn't want to speak to media because he's been instructed not to speak to media because he's gotten the Turning Point chapter into trouble before for speaking out in the media. And he just doesn't want to do that. And I said, "That seems very strange to me." "What are you—what are you saying to me?" You have a TPUSA person who can't speak out about things. There were tons of people that were talking about their testimonies. It's very odd. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, you're telling me that Turning Point USA sent around a text and said, "Nobody speak to the media"? That was his excuse, by the way, for why he shut that guy up. People were saying, "Oh, you know, they're not allowed to speak to the media." So they were just doing what they were told.
