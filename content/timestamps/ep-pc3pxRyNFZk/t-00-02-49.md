## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm usually not interested in delving into most of this kind of online chatter, and I apologize if this is somewhat graphic, but in this case, the fact that there wasn't an exit wound is probably another miracle, and I want people to know. I just spoke with the surgeon who worked on Charlie (Charlie Kirk) in the hospital. He said the bullet absolutely should have gone through, which is very normal for a high-powered, high-velocity round. I've seen wounds from this caliber many times, and they always just go through everything. This would have taken a moose or two down, an elk, et cetera, but it didn't go through. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) body stopped it. I mentioned to his doctor that there were dozens of staff, students, and special guests standing directly behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk) on the other side of the tent. And he replied, 'It was an absolute miracle that someone else didn't get killed.'
