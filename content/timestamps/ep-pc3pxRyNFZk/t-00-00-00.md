## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys. Happy Thursday. Last show until I take a much-needed break. And it's gonna be a good one. As always, as we continue this investigation, we are definitively getting closer. So what do we recall? Well, we were told that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) just had healthy bones. That it was a miracle that the gun did not take his neck out and that his spine somehow stopped it. I can now officially debunk that Marvel storyline and therefore refocus our investigation on what actually happened on 9/10 because I have new information, and I'm presenting it to the public today. Plus, later on the show, Josh Hammer has emerged. You know, he's the one that thinks that all white men, all white European men, are anti-Semitic.
