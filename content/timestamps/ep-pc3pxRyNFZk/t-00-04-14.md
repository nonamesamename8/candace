## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Yes, a surgeon can tell you—or actually any person with common sense can tell you—that your bone density is better when you're younger, but this seemed a little bit too performative. Now, I can tell you... The part that he is telling the truth about is that Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) neck indeed did stop the bullet, without question, okay? And this is going to dispel a lot of theories that are out there. And I'm telling you this 100%. Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) was shot from the front, and the bullet did not exit. And at least a fragment of the bullet was recovered from his neck. And I'm going to tell you exactly where it was recovered from. I have fact-checked this information from multiple sources now.
