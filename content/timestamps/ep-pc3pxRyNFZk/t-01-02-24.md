And there I was putting her hair into pigtails at nine o'clock p.m., well past her bedtime, because she just wanted to look cute. So toddlers have a way of avoiding bedtime. And it's expert. It is expert level. Born Free writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), I have been a fan since 2018." "Finally got my wife on board last year." "She's now in your book club and a loyal fan, and we never miss an episode." "We love you so much, crisis queen." Tell her thank you. We're definitely a bit wild in the book club.
