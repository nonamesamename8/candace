> Telling you about Seven Weeks Coffee because you already drink coffee, and Seven Weeks is an American pro-life coffee company that's on a mission to fund the pro-life movement one cup of coffee at a time. And they just hit an amazing milestone: over $1 million donated to the pro-life movement. Now, why are they called Seven Weeks? You already know: because at seven weeks, a baby is the size of a coffee bean, and at the same time, a heartbeat is clearly detected on an ultrasound. That's why they donate 10% of every sale to support pregnancy care centers across all 50 states, providing life-saving ultrasounds, resources for moms in need, and real hope for families. It all started with just one simple idea: Use your morning coffee to stand for life. Seven Weeks Coffee is more than a great-tasting coffee. It's mold-free, pesticide-free, shade-grown, low-acid, and it's organically farmed, so it truly checks all the boxes.
