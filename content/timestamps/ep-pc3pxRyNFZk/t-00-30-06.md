## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I knew something wasn't right, but you can't just always go off of just "we know something's not right." We have to figure out what exactly it is that is incorrect here. Then I also decided to prod the narrative further. Another person gave us a tip and said, "Hey, did you know that there's literally someone who works at Caldera Engineering who is a professional actor?" No background engineering, went to school for theater, worked in theater, was in plays, was involved in plays. I looked through everything, went through it. I'm like, "This doesn't make sense." "Why is he suddenly at Caldera Engineering?" Like not later in life, just like randomly on his resume is Caldera Engineering.
