## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> That is not Andrew Colvett in that video. A lot of people were like, "Is this Andrew Colvett from Turning Point USA hiding under a hat?" It is not true. I spoke to Andrew on this actual day. He definitively flew in to Utah after the shooting took place. He was not therefore on the ground. But the person that is in that video—as soon as I just put up a picture and I said, "I'd like to identify this person"— his friend first left a nasty comment, like, "Why are you trying to look out for this guy?" "He did the right thing." "How dare we ask questions?" Like, how dare we try to get testimony from anybody else that day? Kind of then messages me privately because I reached out, and I'm like, "I'm just trying to confirm the story." And I reached out, and he says to me—well, and I'm paraphrasing here—he doesn't want to speak to you.
