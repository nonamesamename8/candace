I can tell you definitively—definitively, definitively, definitively—that Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) shot did not come from behind. I can just take that or leave that. You can still go down that narrative. You can think that you saw that. I'm not saying that a shot wasn't fired from behind. I'm not saying that. Like I said, I've given you my theory.
