## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Again, more tips at CandaceOwens.com. All right, you guys, I'm going to throw it to some sponsors. First and foremost, Preborn! You guys know I love them because I have watched too many people who I am close to be vilified for standing up for truth. And many people have felt the sting of injustice for that. But I've also realized that people are feeling encouraged and are done with playing defense—not watering down what we believe needs to be watered down in order for it to be palatable. Because silence isn't kindness; of course, it's consent. And right now, the greatest silence is around the lives being ended before they even take their first breath. If we're going to call ourselves defenders of life, we should act like it. And that's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, with love.
