## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Nimi is the reason that my skin stays clear, firm, and glowing no matter what the weather brings. Their three-step anti-aging routine is the perfect defense for this seasonal shift. It's packed with powerful, clinically-backed ingredients that work to restore your skin's barrier—which is exactly what you need to fight off that dry autumn air. It boosts collagen production to help with those fine lines, locks in deep moisture, and it brightens your complexion, bringing back that healthy glow that you had in the summer. And here's what I love most: Nimi is proudly American-made in a world of skincare that's dominated by foreign brands. Nimi formulates and produces everything right here in the USA. They deliver world-class quality while staying true to the values that we hold dear, which is faith, family, and freedom. You shouldn't have to compromise your values to get good skincare. So go ahead and get an exclusive 10% off your order at nimiyskincare.com.
