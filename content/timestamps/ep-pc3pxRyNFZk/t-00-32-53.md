## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I'm looking at these early documents, and I'm like, "Wait a second, I know this lawyer." This lawyer was introduced to me by Tyler Bowyer at Turning Point USA. I've worked with this lawyer. I paid this lawyer. This is crazy. So what is the pipeline between Utah and Phoenix? I don't know. You can use a lawyer anywhere, but usually when you're formulating your company... Maybe it was a friend; I don't know. But I now have a ton of questions about Caldera Engineering. So if you have any information—are you able to find anything about them? Or maybe you are an engineer, and you're like, "I've been buying their valves actually for 20 years, actually." "And they're fantastic." "They work great." I'd like to hear from you.
