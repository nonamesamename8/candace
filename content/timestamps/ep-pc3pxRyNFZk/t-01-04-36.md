## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So many moms are pulling their kids out that they're now trying to pass laws against homeschooling. That's amazing. I mean, not amazing trying to pass laws, but it's amazing that they're feeling the pressure, which I will speak about more obviously in the weeks to come and exactly what we're doing and how we're doing it. We're still figuring this thing out. But every day is a new adventure, and I hope that I inspire people to take the step. You will figure it out. Human beings are adaptable, and I can tell you it is way more rewarding. Anyways, you guys, I am going on vacation. Love you. Send me tips if you have them about the topics that we discussed today. Tips@CandaceOwens.com or moretips@CandaceOwens.com. I will obviously be lurking.
