## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Anyways, his response yesterday to our episode was to release text messages between him and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) following the call. Great; it lets us know that the call happened at the exact same time that we figured it would actually happen in a timeline that had to have been an evening call before he tweeted "public execution" in this three-hour window. But these are the messages. We should read them. Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk): "Thank you for your help, guys." A totally standard response that you say no matter what. Exclamation point. And then I assume this is Josh Hammer that replies and says, "Good luck at the campus visit start." "Don't hesitate to let me know or any of us know how we can help." "What's your first stop tomorrow, by the way?"
