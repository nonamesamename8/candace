## Transcript

**Clip: Phil Lyman:**
> I'm looking like, "What was that?" "What was that?" And pretty soon some people started, you know, running. Everyone was trying to process, and I thought, "This is a gunshot, and there's going to be more of them. I thought it could turn into a mass shooting." So I go to the people closest to me. Everyone's ducking down behind the concrete retaining walls, and some of them are still kind of oblivious. But there are two people that were standing there: two girls, very goth, very black, you know. And then I just walked—I stepped up to the side—and I said, "Did that not happen right here?" "Did you hear that?" "Was that right here?" They said, "Yeah, it was just right over there." So they're confirming, yeah, the shooter—or wherever that sound came from—is right here. The thing that didn't really dawn on me is that they were not running. They were not frightened.
