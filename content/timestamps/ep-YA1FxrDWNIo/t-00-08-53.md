## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Many of you figured out, by the way, and wrote to the tips box exactly what we were interested about in that person with the blue hat. You noticed the same thing that we noticed. He kind of resembles, certainly more so than Tyler Robinson does, the blurred image of the individual that was coming up the stairs. I couldn't look away from that. I was going through the photos, and I was going, "Hmm, I would just like to quickly identify that individual and check him off and just know where he was because, yeah, it looks to be about the same height." It's weird. Oddly—this is, when I say oddly, I mean—this has never happened in the history of all of our investigations.
