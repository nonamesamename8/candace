Keyholing is if the bullet is too slow and tumbles and has external impact. The other is pinball bullets, where they bounce internally—causing internal damage to the target. So pinball bullets are the ones that cause internal damage. Very interesting. George writes, "We love you, Candy." "I pray the truth gets out soon." "Keep up the great work." The truth, George—it's inevitable. It is. It's not fun to be a liar because you got to squirm. And I appreciate the hand that they played here. I totally get the hand that they played here. They are lying.
