## Transcript

**Clip: Phil Lyman:**
> [Clip: Phil Lyman on Alex Jones] Just yesterday, someone comes in and says, "Yeah, we've got video." He came off the roof. He walked up. He came up here to the parking lot, got in the car with an individual, and they drove away. Well, that's not the story that came. It's that he escaped another route, and there are people who are coordinating this thing. I do not believe that that .30-06 that they showed—recovered in the bushes—was ever on the roof. I think it was in the bushes to start with. And now I'm not saying that Tyler Robinson wasn't on the roof. I'm not saying he didn't pull a trigger. I know I was in very, very close proximity. So another interesting thing—like I say—I left the front of the stage. I wanted to meet some of my friends and bring them down front. So it was clear at the east end. And I heard this loud boom. I heard this loud bang. And I turned around.
