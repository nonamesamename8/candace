## Transcript

> Again, I'm not here to read into how people might act in an emergency event, but I thought it was weird that he was there in general— actually, that he was behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk) the entire time. I've never seen that. He's never been behind me at an event. He's never been lingering around me at an event. And I asked about that. I asked about just his presence behind Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and plus the mysterious phone call that he was seen making in—like—minute three after Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was assassinated. And he... he told me explicitly that they were trying something new that day— like it was something new. Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) super ambitious and, on the AV thing, they were trying something new, and they wanted to be able to feed it back instantly to Arizona.
