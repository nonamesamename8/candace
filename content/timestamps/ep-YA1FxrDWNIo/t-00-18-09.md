Kind of weird, for me, and there's a reason why I'm saying that: to hone in on these two individuals and to say, like, "gothic," and to pretend that they were doing something that looked abnormal—given the fact that in the longer video, everyone up top is quite calm. Because I don't think they're really entirely sure what is happening.
