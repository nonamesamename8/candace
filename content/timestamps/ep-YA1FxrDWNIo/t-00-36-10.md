## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> About 48 hours before Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) died, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) informed people at Turning Point—as well as Jewish donors and a rabbi—that he had no choice but to abandon the pro-Israel cause outright, okay? Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was done. He said it explicitly: that he refused to be bullied anymore by the Jewish donors. Can you guys answer? Did he express that? Did he also express that he wanted to bring me, Candace Owens, back because he was standing up for himself? And then did he—just 48 hours later—conveniently catch a bullet to the throat before our onstage reunion could happen? It's a yes or a no, okay? Let's stop this ditching. Let's stop the dodging.
