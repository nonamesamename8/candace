## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

And then we received some leads that I think have helped to clarify exactly what sort of a detective he was and maybe why he was not featured in a lot of articles—because he was, as it appears to be, an undercover detective. By all accounts, he was an online detective. Apparently, if this is the correct Mike Mitchell—and given the timeline of when he becomes an undercover detective, I have a strong hunch that it is the right individual, because he says, you know, he was on the force for 25 years.
