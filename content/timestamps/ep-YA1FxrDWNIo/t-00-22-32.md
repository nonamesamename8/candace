## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> He is a police detective hunting for a pedophile. But the hunted doesn't know that. Mitchell, a detective with the Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office, has been investigating child sex crimes on the Internet for about a year. ‘I don't think people realize how big it is,’ he tells them.” Okay, so that's interesting to me. Okay. And we can't then go, "Okay, let's make a jump here." Just because he's creating messages online—first and foremost—doesn't necessarily mean that he's the person that authored the fake messages. And I'm implying that. But I do actually think it was quite interesting because when we covered George Zinn—who was the decoy boy that day— who then we find out is into pedophilia, right?
