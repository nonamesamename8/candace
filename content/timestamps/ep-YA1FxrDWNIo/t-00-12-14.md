## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That was a part of his story. He saw these gothic girls, and they seemed unfazed in all of the chaos, you know? And I thought that was an interesting way to describe someone as gothic. Gratefully, Phil Lyman did send us footage of him after the shots rang out. And I am saying shots, plural, for a reason, because we will show you that video. But first, I want to recap what specifically Phil said publicly about where he was when the shots rang out. Because I vaguely remembered him painting a picture that he was outside. That certainly seems to be what he told both Alex Jones and NewsNation: that he was outside when the shot rang out. Let's take a listen to what he said on Alex Jones.
