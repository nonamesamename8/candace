## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, so a couple of those statements are what I would describe as little lies. Well, they're just not true. Because at 12:23—according to his metadata, because he sent it to me—Phil Lyman was inside of the building. And he must have then—immediately, according to our timeline—hit record, and he didn't run. He calmly walked out of Sorensen Building. I hope I'm saying that right: the Sorensen Building. And he wasn't the only one that was walking calmly. And I'm not, by the way, none of these people are suspicious to me walking calmly, because they're inside the building—not really sure what they heard, perhaps—and they're all kind of walking calmly out. And I'm going to show you that footage. And to be clear, you're going to see two girls that are simply wearing black. By no stretch of the imagination
