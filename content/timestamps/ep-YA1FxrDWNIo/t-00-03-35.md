## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, I'll let you guys know that when our episode finished yesterday, I had a message or two from Phil Lyman—despite the fact that I had reached out to him hours before we began our show—and he was understandably upset. He, at first, was sort of focusing his energy toward Nick, the person that I told you worked on his campaign and just wanted to help out in the investigation. Now, Phil would like me to clarify that Nick never worked on his campaign. And by the way, I looked back, and that was actually my mistake, not Nick's. I thought that when Nick had first introduced Lyman to me over the phone, that he said, "Oh, like, I am, you know, I'm working on his campaign." And apparently, that was not accurate.
