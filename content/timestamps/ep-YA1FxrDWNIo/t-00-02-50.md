## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We introduced—and I said his name was Shane; I'd like to correct that record—his nephew, Shaner Broderick, who rather notoriously retraced the footpath of the killer with his two close friends. They were like, "Here, here it is." The Converse footprint is right here. They even created a map. Okay, Shaner even created a map of where exactly the killer walked, and the media used his map. And of course, the Lymans' car was in the driveway just 20 minutes before—I feel Lyman reiterated to Fox News—which is 20 minutes before I pulled into the driveway at my aunt's house, and I parked my car, and then 20 minutes later, the killer killer was limping by.
