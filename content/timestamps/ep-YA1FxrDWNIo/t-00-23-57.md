## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Somebody attended this goth prom in Provo, Utah. Somebody overseas perhaps recognizes that person. Like I said, I would venture a guess that he is not from Utah because I've never seen no hits come in— somebody saying, "I went to high school with him." And yeah, that's what I want you to focus your attention on. Tips@candaceowens.com. Again, reminding you guys, please do not send us—because we're such a small team—please do not send us TikTok videos and say, "You should watch this," or, "You know, look at this theory." Reserve that to simply tagging our accounts when you are on those specific apps, and we will pick up from there. We got to get into the Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) legacy.
