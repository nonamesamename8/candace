## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> When I asked them why, they told me that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) wanted to go a different direction by getting an army vest instead—like a metal army vest, I believe is what he says. And he said, "This made no sense." He didn't understand it. Okay, so Charlie (Charlie Kirk) decided—they decided—to use a new company—even though I don't think he was actually wearing a bullet vest on that day. So what happened there? I'm not sure. Something else that is really bothering me—just because I have done these campus tours—is the question of why Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was set to do two events in Utah, a mere 20 days apart, okay?
