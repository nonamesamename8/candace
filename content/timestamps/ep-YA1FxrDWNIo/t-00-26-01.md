> if you head over to RiverbendRanch.com, you can use promo code KANDICE at checkout, and you'll get $20 off your first order. And I can promise you guys that you will be incredibly impressed. So visit RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code KANDICE. Also telling you guys about Beekeepers Naturals products, because as a mom of four young kids, life is constantly on the move. There are school drop-offs, work, travel, play dates, and let's be honest, germs are everywhere. That's why I'm very grateful that Beekeepers Naturals has their amazing propolis throat spray—because if you haven't heard of propolis, it's this natural immune-supporting substance that bees make to protect their hives. It's like nature's own shield, packed with antioxidants. There's over 300 beneficial compounds. It's been used actually for centuries—obviously—to help support immunity, soothe scratchy throats, plus keep you feeling your best.
