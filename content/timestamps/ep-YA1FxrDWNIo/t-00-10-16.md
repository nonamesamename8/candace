## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Anyways, his name is Gernot Omer, and we were able to find that his face matched with photos from a blog post that was written in German that was basically entitled “Anniversary Hike: 10 Years on Foot to the Sea.” The blog is about a group of 30-year-olds who were recreating a hike that they took together when they were 20. Now, I don't even know if I'm saying his name right—Gernot, Gurnot. I guess it is a common name in Austria. And there were a few photos of him that were available.
