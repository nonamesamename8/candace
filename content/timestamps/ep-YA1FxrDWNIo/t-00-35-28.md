## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I don't know how you can present yourselves as a Christian organization and not be dedicating yourself to the truth—no matter what the cost is. You tell the truth; that's it, okay? You don't hide it. You don't try to obfuscate it. You don't try to say, "Well, wait until the memorial event before we start looking into who murdered him." You tell the truth, and you tell it immediately. I don't think they're capable of doing that. And I have an idea as to why that is. I think the same people that were pressuring Charlie (Charlie Kirk) are pressuring them. In fact, I know that for a fact. So they might need my help. Okay. I'm going to state this, and I'm going to challenge Turning Point USA executives to issue a very clean statement saying that I am lying if this is not true.
