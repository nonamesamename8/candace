## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, I asked Phil Lyman three times via text whether or not he could help us—more importantly—identify the two individuals that were in the photo with his nephew or cousin, if you will. And he was kind of pretending to be confused about what photo in particular I was referring to—despite the fact that I sent it multiple times in the text chain. And then finally he said that he had no idea who those two individuals were at all. I thought that's interesting. This is allegedly your nephew, cousin. You guys are all chilling on this block around the same time. He's with these two individuals. You've never heard of them. You've never seen them. Nothing. Because I got to identify that guy in the blue hat.
