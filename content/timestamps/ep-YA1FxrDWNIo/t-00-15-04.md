## Transcript

**SPEAKER_3:**
> [Clip: Phil Lyman on NewsNation] I walked up top. I had to go meet some people. So I was down there. When he started talking, I thought, "I'm going to go up top and meet some of the people." So I got clear up on top. And I was just coming around the corner, walking into one of the buildings. And I heard a loud bang that I thought was right behind me. And I turned around, looked at the girl that was there. And she was kind of looking stunned. Like, "What was that?" And I'm looking at her. And then I see a little bit of commotion. I realize, right then, it's a gunshot. So I ran out—the people running into the building—I ran out to see who it was. I'm thinking, "This is a lot of kids out here." And then a few minutes later, then the police were running, saying, "Did anybody see?" "Did anybody see?" I think it was on the roof above me.
