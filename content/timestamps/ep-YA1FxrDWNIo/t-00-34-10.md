## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So my question is, why isn't Turning Point USA making any statements and shutting down this repeat attempt by Israel to lie and to pretend that, towards the end, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was just authoring love letters to Israel—giving them a perspective of, "Here's how we can win, here's what you guys need to do, you need to work with this Hillel, whatever it is. You have the same people that are calling me anti-Semitic. You need to work with those people harder." And he was just putting it on paper. Was it an email? What was that that they were sharing on it? The New York Post, the Israeli Post, right? What were they sharing there? He wrote of his deep love for Israel. He had nothing else to do in May. Wrote of his deep love for Israel. It's a letter to Netanyahu.
