## Transcript

**Clip: Phil Lyman:**
> In fact, as I stepped up, I heard one of the girls—and they were talking to each other—and they're looking at these kids, looking at the scene down below them of all these people fleeing for their lives. And she says, "Go F yourselves." And like I said, I was not processing. I was trying to figure out what was going on. I thought this is a separate conversation. I don't know what it is. In hindsight, as I've watched that over and over, it's like these people were not afraid. Okay, and on NewsNation, I want you to listen carefully because he at first says that he was about to walk into the building and the shot rang out, but then he says he ran out of the building after the shot rang out.
