## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> They've created the Smart Equity Loan, which is a solution designed to help you take control of your finances without touching your current mortgage. Unlike a HELOC—which can have varied interest rates—the Smart Equity Loan offers a fixed rate. That means one predictable monthly payment—giving you peace of mind. This loan allows you to leverage the equity in your home to pay off high-interest debt, free up your cash flow, and keep your existing home mortgage rate intact. It only takes 10 minutes to get started with no upfront or hidden fees. You can call American Financing, and you can start saving now. The number is 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210, or you can visit AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. Again, that's AmericanFinancing.net/Owens. All right, you guys, hope I've made myself clear. I'm done dancing.
