## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> A couple of people who actually were out there are ducking. He was on the inside. Like I said, this was at 12:23, so he was inside, walked out, and then he's gonna start a conversation with two people that are just wearing black, and... And then you see he continues. If he goes on for like three minutes, he just sort of walks down, and he engages in a conversation with those two girls, and they answer him. There's nothing here that seems to me to be controversial. When he hears them say something about "F you," it's before he has a conversation with them. It does happen. Take a listen.
