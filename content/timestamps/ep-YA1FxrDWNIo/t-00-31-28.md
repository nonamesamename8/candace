## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, in terms of other things that were new, they announced on that same day that Andrew Zenger was announced as a new CEO. That was also the day that they announced Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) tour. They announced five dates, and two of them were in Utah—dispersed throughout the month. It is also interesting to note that the Utah FBI also got a brand-new set of employees—the state FBI department. Kash Patel went ahead and fired not only the chief of the Utah bureau, but also some other people. You can see this in the Daily Mail article. They recount this after Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) death. “Kash Patel questions grow as it's revealed he gutted the Utah FBI leadership before Charlie Kirk's (Charlie Kirk's) assassination.” That is true.
