## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I am done dancing with all of these frauds. It's just unbelievable. It really is unbelievable. Do me a favor. Don't ever let anybody try to speak out who just tortured you your whole life and then pretend to say something nice. Please don't do that. Just call them out on being hideous individuals, you know? When you end up in a world where—like—a couple of days before Charlie Kirk (Charlie Kirk) dies—someone like Laura Loomer is calling him anti-Semite, and she's funded by one of Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) donors, Bob Shillman—who then does a 180 and is now pretending that she is morally fighting me to stop researching into Charlie's (Charlie Kirk's) murder—you know exactly what kind of world you live in. Politics sickens me. It really does. Everybody who has a little wish out there—"Oh, Candace (Candace Owens), like, jump into politics"—
