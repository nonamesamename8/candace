## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I even remember, by the way, when we were all speaking about that plane transponder that turned off, that the individuals that owned that plane were wearing an Operation Underground Railroad t-shirt. So I wasn't expecting that. I am going to reach out to Tim Ballard. I know him. I've actually interviewed him. And I used to donate to that charity because I was so moved by my interview with him when I was working for Prager University. But moving on from that, Phil also disputes something that was quite strange: that Shaner Broderick is his nephew. I said, "Okay, wait a minute." Actually, Shaner Broderick literally posted that on his Instagram. He said, "My uncle, Phil Lyman." But Phil seems like he's trying to distance himself for some reason from Shaner.
