## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> But Turning Point USA, I think, got a little bit bigger than Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and I'm no longer gonna allow this lie and this narrative. So answer the questions, yes or no. And I'm going to—again—challenge you to lie. And if you do lie, I'm gonna expose the lies, and I'm gonna start dropping videos—actually. So that's where I'm at. Enough of the games, enough with trying to allow Israel to wrangle a narrative that you know is not true. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) did not die pro-Israel. He did not die for Israel. He did not martyr himself as a friend of Israel. In fact, the friends of Israel were pressuring him really badly, and he was done, and he finally stood up for himself. And I'm proud of that. And I will say this: you know what? Somewhere Charlie (Charlie Kirk) is watching, okay? And I hope he knows that we are reunited, okay?
