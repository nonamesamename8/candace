## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Netanyahu said they were close, but in the letter, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) puts his number—which apparently Netanyahu didn't have his number. And we're supposed to believe—did he send that as an email, by the way? Can somebody clarify? Was that an email they were sharing? Or did he send it in the mail to him? Could somebody just share that, please? I'm assuming it was an email. Can someone share the timestamp on that? Just kind of, like, authenticate that email—because I'm very aware of what's going on, okay? And I don't know how the executives over at Turning Point USA sleep at night, okay?
