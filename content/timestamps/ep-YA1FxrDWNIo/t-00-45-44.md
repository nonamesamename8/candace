## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Maybe like five minutes ago. I'm trying to be more conscious, but I am— oh, man, I'm working on this anger. I'm working on just really appreciating how fake and gay it all is. Like, I'm just seeing these people just say, "Move on, move on from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." "It's good; we're gonna accept the narrative." "We're just gonna let the FBI do what the FBI does, and we're just gonna pretend these glaring, obvious lies and holes mean nothing and also work behind the scenes with the very people that were torturing Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." That is just not allowed. It's not allowed. Natalie writes, "Candace (Candace Owens), I am giddy AF watching you today." "You are on fire. To your audience, let's keep up the prayers, y'all." "Christ is King." Thank you so much, Natalie. I really appreciate that, and I appreciate all of your support. Marzi, thank you for your support.
