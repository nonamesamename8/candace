## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This individual began his career in 1999. His job—Detective Mike Mitchell—was to create messages online to entrap pedophiles, okay, by pretending that he was underage. You guys know—you've heard about these sorts of stings. You pretend that you're underage as an officer and see people that try to hook up with you, and then you make an arrest. And so we can take a look at this article from November of 1999. It says, “Police surf Internet to snag pedophiles.” And it tells us, “Mike Mitchell sits at a desk tapping on a computer keyboard and becomes a boy. He's chatting with someone now. His words are full of typos and misspellings and childlike phrases. Mike Mitchell is not a boy.
