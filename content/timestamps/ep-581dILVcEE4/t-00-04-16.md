## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> A high government source actually reached out and made me aware. And this is stunning, actually, that we missed this common sense. I should have figured this out all by myself. But there is such a thing as federal protocol. They told me this person in the State Department confirmed that a foreign military jet actually can't just land on American soil without the federal government paying attention. It actually requires a federal escort. Okay? Again, common sense. I don't know how we didn't think of this ourselves. Of course, if you're a military jet, you can't just fly into foreign land and hop off the jet and be like, "Okay, bye." "Just gonna do whatever I want." Of course, they're gonna go, "Am I high?" "Are we starting a war here?"
