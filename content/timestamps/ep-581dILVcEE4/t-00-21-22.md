## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> More tips at candaceowens.com. Okay, we're going to be right back because Turning Point is dropping receipts—kind of a little bit. We're going to talk about Blake Neff, who dropped a receipt; Brian Harpole, the security who dropped a receipt—right after a few of our sponsors. Many people have been vilified for standing up for truth, and many people have felt the sting of injustice for doing so. But a lot of people right now are also feeling courageous. Many of us are done playing defense. I'm certainly not watering down what I believe to be palatable because silence is not kindness. Of course, silence is consent. And right now, the greatest silence surrounds the topic of those whose lives are ended before they take their first breath. If we are going to call ourselves defenders of life, then we have to act like it always.
