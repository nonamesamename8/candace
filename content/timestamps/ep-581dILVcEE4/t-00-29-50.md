## Transcript

**Brian Harpole:**
> And then you had secondary restrictions probably due to heavy foot traffic for the school, but I can't go in and break the rules. There's laws for a reason. And then, and so now the school could have flown drones—the PD—but they didn't have them, right? And then, and then so—but Orem PD has a drone unit, active and professional. And that police department, I will tell you right now, is awesome. They are; they get it. They were there; they helped both on the soft side and the hard side. And so I started asking questions: "You guys have a drone unit?" "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, good." "Do you have an MOU or a mutual aid agreement with the school?" And they're like, "Yeah."
