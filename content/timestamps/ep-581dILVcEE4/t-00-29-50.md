## Transcript

**SPEAKER_3:**

And that police department, I will tell you right now, is awesome. They are; they get it. They were there; they helped both on the soft side and the hard side. And so I started asking questions: "You guys have a drone unit?" "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, good." "Do you have an MOU or a mutual aid agreement with the school?" And they're like, "Yeah."
