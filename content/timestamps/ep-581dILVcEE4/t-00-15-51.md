## Transcript

**Student Interview:**
> Yeah, there's kind of a railing around there's this like concourse sticking out from the CS building that people are actually supposed to be allowed to walk on. Okay. And he walked over that railing and started wandering around the ledge. Oh, OK. And facing which way? He was totally looking out in the direction of that fountain courtyard and out this way. The first time I thought it was a little weird, but didn't think much of it. Decided not to say anything, especially because another guy walked back. I think he was a professor. I don't—I've seen him around a lot more. And he comes from below, and he shouts up at the guy. He asks, "Are you OK?" The guy up there says, "Yeah, yeah, I'm doing fine." And the professor says, "OK," and walks away.
