## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> First up, many of you guys pinged me regarding Brian Harpole in an interview that he did with Sean Bryan. Now, Brian Harpole is one of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s long-term security team members. On the day of the assassination, you'll recognize he's the guy that had the black strap. I don't know if we have a photo. He had a bag across him, and he was standing to the front right of Charlie (Charlie Kirk), kind of looking out at the audience. You're going to see him in a second. He is the one who then runs over to Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And again, you recognize him because he kind of has that small supposed-to-be-a-medical bag over him. I have not watched this interview in its entirety, but from what I have seen thus far, it is just not that convincing.
