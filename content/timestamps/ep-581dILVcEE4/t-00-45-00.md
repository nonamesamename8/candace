**SPEAKER_1:**
> You get the Botanical Bliss body wash to gently cleanse with soothing botanicals, the revitalizing sugar scrub to exfoliate and hydrate with vitamin C plus coconut oil, and the restorative body lotion to deeply moisturize. It leaves your skin feeling smooth, hydrated, and healthy. And just like their facial skincare, Neemy's body line is made with clean, clinically proven ingredients. And best of all, it's made right here in the USA by a company that's built on our values: faith, family, and of course, freedom. Finally, you can stop supporting radical corporations and give your money to a company that actually honors you. It's time to take care of all of your skin with products that you can trust. So head to neemyskincare.com. Use my code CANDACE10 at checkout, and you'll get 10% off your entire order. Again, that's neemyskincare.com.
