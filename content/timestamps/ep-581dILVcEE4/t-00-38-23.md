## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I have never seen such an obvious and naked propagandist campaign in my life than me exploring the Calvary Chapel Church movement. So America's Pastor Rob McCoy was in Jerusalem on November 16th, apparently. A couple days ago, he was at an event. It was billed as a celebration of the life of Charlie (Charlie Kirk). And what better way to celebrate the life of Charlie (Charlie Kirk) than to take questions from the audience about—you guessed it—Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and Candace (Candace Owens). Take it away, Israel.
