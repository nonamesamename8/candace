## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I think that's your job. Like, am I crazy, or is that his job? Is it his job to call and to see things through if Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) paying him for executive-level security? Like, is this how these assassinations happen? Is that what's happening even like at the White House level with the Thomas Crooks thing? Is that what happened? Like Secret Service just called locally in Pennsylvania and was like, "Hey, that looks like trouble up there." "Could you maybe get a guy up there or let me know or if like whatever?" And then they were just like, "Yeah, sure, gotcha," and they just figured it was accomplished. I don't accept any of that. You shouldn't accept any of that, nor do I find him to be convincing, right?
