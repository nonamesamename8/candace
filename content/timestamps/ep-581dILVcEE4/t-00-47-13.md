> Also reminding you guys: if you'd like to support us, "Make Him a Sandwich" is available. You can go to makehimasandwich.com. If you'd like to pick up a regular copy, we also have signed copies at candaceowens.com. We also have new merch on the website. Plus our Black Friday sale is active. You can use code BLACK20 for 20% off. That's store-wide. It does not include books, and that runs through to Cyber Monday. So do not miss out. And reminding you guys that book club this week is going to be on Thursday. I don't know if I even told you guys that. I think we sent out an email, but telling you this for the first time on the show that we bumped it to six o'clock Eastern on Thursday. So no book club tonight. We'll have it at 6 PM Eastern on Thursday.
