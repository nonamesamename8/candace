So like if I published your private address and then somebody could go to your home and harm you, that's what they're accusing me of. Erin Wexler—now this is the girl that was at the now infamous Hamptons retreat— She wrote this: "Candace (Candace Owens) started her career by doxing teenagers." "Old habits die hard." That is just so weird. I just thought she, the Hamptons people, would be on this Egyptian thing, trying to help as best they could, but they're actually more concerned for these Egyptians who are renting a car, and therefore, since they don't even go here, like, why would this be identifying information?
