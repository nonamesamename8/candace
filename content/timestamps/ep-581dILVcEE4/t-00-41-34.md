## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I guess we're gonna be able to read this article in there. "Why Jews are hated." You go to your church on Sunday, and this is what they are handing out.

Oh, actually, it's a photo of IDF soldiers wearing yarmulkes coming home. And it has a quotation here that said, "God began to paint a prophetic portrait of the Messiah." I just want to know how this happened, I guess. I don't know. I was asleep. I didn't know this was going on. I didn't understand that they have so many megachurches everywhere—everywhere across America.
