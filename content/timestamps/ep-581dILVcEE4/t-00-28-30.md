## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Why is the student and the chief leading the charge and not you when you are paid for executive-level security? It is an unacceptable answer. Look, I've worked with Brian. Nice guy. That's a ridiculous answer. He should be fired. And I'm going to guess he's not going to be, but he should be fired. Of course he should be fired. Elsewhere in the interview, he responds to the question of why they didn't at least have drone coverage on that day since they have flown drones—many drones—at TPUSA events in the past. Here's his answer to that.
