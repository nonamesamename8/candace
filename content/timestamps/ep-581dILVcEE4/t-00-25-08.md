## Transcript

**SPEAKER_3:**
> (Brian Harpole Clip) On Monday before this correspondence went to Chief Long: "Hello, Chief Long." "We received this message today from the student group." "There is a student roof access pretty close to where CK will be set up at the Utah Valley—the Sorensen Center." "It has a couple of staircases that go up to walkways on the roofs." He comes back for edification: the Sorensen Center was the building in front of the Lozier Center. And so he comes back, and he says, "You want access to the roof?" And came back and said, "I was told students have access above us."
