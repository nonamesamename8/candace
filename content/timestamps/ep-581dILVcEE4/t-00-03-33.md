## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Are you concerned for, like, Hertz rent-a-car? What are you concerned about here? We're not clear. Now, going back to what we've learned about this flight thus far, I want to remind you that we have confirmed that this was a full flight over to Utah. This Egyptian flight—and I'm referring to SU-BTT—landed in Utah six days before Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s assassination. So we are looking at anywhere between 12 to 14 quote-unquote Egyptians that were on this flight and deplaned on September 4th, okay?
