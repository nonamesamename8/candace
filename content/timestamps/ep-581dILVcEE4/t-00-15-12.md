## Transcript

**SPEAKER_2:**
> I just know I saw a guy wandering around on the roof, and the guy that I saw in the pictures looks similar. But it was the same roof of the same building? Yes. Well, I don't know that exactly because it's the computer science building has this long concourse that connects to the Lozier Center. My bet would be that that's how the shooter got onto the Lozier Center roof because that's... one of the few ways I know of. I guess there's also a ladder on the other side. As in that's how he got on yesterday or last week? Oh, well, last time I saw it, and he came off of there. Okay, and you said he like jumped over the fence?
