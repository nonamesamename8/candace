## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And by the way, while we're checking in on these unanswered questions, has Turning Point mustered the courage to answer my yes or no—circle yes or circle no—as to whether or not these Egyptian jets were known to Charlie (Charlie Kirk)? Because like I said yesterday, it is highly plausible, highly likely that they were. He had a photographic memory, and he loved planes. He loved learning about military planes. He would have recognized that that was circling around him a few times while he was on the road and circling around Erika (Erika Kirk). Ladies and gentlemen, I want to make it very clear. Yes, this is a conspiracy. It is a federal-level conspiracy. It is likely an international conspiracy.
