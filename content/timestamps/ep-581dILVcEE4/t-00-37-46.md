## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**

So it's possible 45 seconds later he's now in the 12:25, and now Mikey's calling his dad. That's very interesting. That's just another data point that we at least have there. Moving on to the pastor—America's pastor—Rob McCoy. I just think in general, by the way, I want to give a shout-out to Calvary Chapel because I knew nothing about Calvary Chapel before this investigation. These pastors are doing the absolute most.
