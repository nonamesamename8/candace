## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That's why I'm asking you to join me to fight back with action, with truth, and with love. Just $28—which is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that is in crisis and considering an abortion—you can help her see the life that is growing inside of her. $28 will help her to see the truth that the culture will not tell her. So do not sit this one out. Do not wait for permission. You can be bold, clear, and unapologetically pro-life by heading to preborn.org/Candace right now. You can give $28, or you can give 10 times that amount if you can. This is the line that we have to stand on. We have to stand up for truth and for justice. We have to save lives from abortion and stand firm in our gospel. Again, that is preborn.org/Candace. Provide an ultrasound for just $28.
