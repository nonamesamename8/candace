## Transcript

**Student Interview:**
> What did he look like? Skinny, tallish white guy. Had like baseball cap on or some kind of hat, I think. Had a backpack. Dark hair, I think. Was he dressed in like dark clothing? Yeah, he was. Was it like black or something? Something dark. Is it similar to what was seen in the pictures? Yeah, for sure. And that's—that's kind of why I thought about when I saw the pictures. I guess I don't think I'd remember enough to really definitively say that the guy I saw is the guy in the pictures.
