## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I'm not interested in Jeff Long's participation in this, but Brian Harpole kind of sort of laments the fact that he won't speak up and people are losing their jobs.

"So we're actually looking at a map, and we see where Charlie's (Charlie Kirk) gonna sit, and we're wondering about this roof." "Could you let us know how we're supposed to access that?"
