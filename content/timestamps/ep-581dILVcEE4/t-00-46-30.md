## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Obviously, Megyn and Kelly happened to have that footage, but they have that footage with like full clarity of exactly what Charlie (Charlie Kirk) said to Tucker (Tucker Carlson). And they have the footage of the donors who freaked out—at least the audio of the donors who freaked out. I told you about a woman who yelled and took away a million dollars because of the Tucker (Tucker Carlson) speech. That woman was Joyce Chernick. Joyce Chernick is married to Aubrey Chernick. He's a software tech billionaire guy. They fund a variety of pro-Israel causes through the David Horowitz Freedom Center. So that was another donor who went, "Bye-bye, Charlie (Charlie Kirk)." "How dare you let him speak and say thanks?"
