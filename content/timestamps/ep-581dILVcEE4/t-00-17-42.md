## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> If you are a student and you saw someone up on the rooftop in the days or in the week leading up to the assassination, we want to hear from you. More tips at candaceowens.com because every time I have tried to chase down the leads regarding the rooftop, I am brought to a military person, and I just don't know that any of that actually took place on the day. And I think that's why they won't release any more footage. There should be multiple angles, right? If this all happened on 9-10, there would have been multiple angles, and they sure as hell would have released it in the middle of a manhunt, when you thought that he could kill other people. You would have released more footage. And they're not doing that, which means they're hiding something. And something that they could be hiding could be nothing.
