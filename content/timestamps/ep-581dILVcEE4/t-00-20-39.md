## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Lewis's foundation website as something—as someone that they fund. I'd like to know who was on that plane. That's interesting to me. If you know who was on that plane and you are a Turning Point insider—or maybe you were working in Scottsdale on that day at a terminal—we're looking for a plane again that took off at about 8 a.m. I wonder who's on that plane. That is of interest to me because it wasn't Charlie (Charlie Kirk), and they got into Provo just ahead of the assassination, and it has to be somebody big. I don't think the students are flying around on private planes. It'd be great if that foundation, T.W. Lewis Foundation, could help us out. I don't think they will for some reason. We keep coming up against the wall from Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s friends, but we want to hear from you.
