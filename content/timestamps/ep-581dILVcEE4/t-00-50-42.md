## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> We should not accept lobbying full stop, but we certainly shouldn't accept this sort of Israel exception, which is they do not have to certify anything under FARA. Obsessed Sports Rights. "If the planes are truly from the Egyptian government, would that mean their passengers in cargo would have diplomatic immunity and allow them to do illicit activities—espionage, weapons trafficking, et cetera—without much oversight?" You are on the right track. Certainly there are a lot of implications with why this plane would be allowed in and the federal government would escort it and then everyone would play dumb when Candace (Candace Owens) mentioned this flight being on the ground. It's interesting. Definitely more questions than answers, but we will have answers for you guys.
