## Transcript

> You can see it was published the day after the assassination, and it reads, "Utah Valley University student recalls seeing man walking on or near the Lozier Center roof twice in two weeks." And from that article, it says the student says that he last saw the person on the roof last Wednesday at noon, a week before the shooting. He told CNN that he reported his observations to the FBI tip line after the shooting, but he has not heard back. The student described the man as tall, skinny-ish, white dude with dark hair. He had a backpack on and was wearing dark clothes. He added that the man was looking down at the courtyard area where Kirk's speaking engagement was later. Okay, now here's what I did.
