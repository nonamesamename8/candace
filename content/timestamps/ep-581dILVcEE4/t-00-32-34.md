## Transcript

**SPEAKER_4:**
> (Blake Neff Clip) The shooting occurs. I am next to Mikey. Both of us hear a loud crack. We both turn. We both see Charlie (Charlie Kirk), who has been shot. Both of us, I think at about the same time, realize that that means there is a shooter who is on the scene. And you just hear the crack. So you don't know: did it come from far away? Did it come from close? Is there a mass shooter unfolding right now? I and him both had the reaction of, "Let's get out of here before we are both shot." That is not us abandoning Charlie (Charlie Kirk). Charlie (Charlie Kirk) had a security team. They all leapt immediately into action, and they got Charlie (Charlie Kirk) out of there, which was what their job was to do. My job was not to get in the way and screw this up because I had to be a hero. That was not my job.
