## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So their filing would have been due on Saturday, this last Saturday, for Turning Point USA. And it is possible that they did file it on Saturday and maybe it's being processed. It would have been late beginning yesterday when we covered it. So I just wanted to update you guys on that. And of course, we will keep refreshing the IRS website and see whether or not that filing came through, since the whole world wants to see it. Anyways, back to our Zionist friends. Israeli and American Zionists are deeply bothered about the Egyptian plane. They're not concerned in the way that you think they would be.
