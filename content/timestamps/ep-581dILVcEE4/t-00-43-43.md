> 99% of the traditional brands die in our stomach acid before they reach our guts. That's what makes Just Thrive's spore-based probiotic completely different. Just Thrive is the only probiotic that is clinically proven to arrive 100 percent alive in our guts. It does something that no other probiotic can. It turns our gut into an antioxidant factory, creating protective compounds exactly where we need them most. That means better digestion, healthy immunity, more energy, and easy weight management. You can take Just Thrive Probiotic in the form of a capsule or a berry-flavored gummy. From their award-winning probiotic to their full line of gut, immune, and brain health supplements, Just Thrive has been fighting to make Americans healthy again with science-backed solutions that we can trust.
