## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Top comment from yesterday's episode is from Abby Sloan. She writes, "I don't think they realize that if Candace (Candace Owens) had an audience of one, she would still be doing this investigation." Amen. Yes, I would still be doing this investigation. And sometimes these investigations do have to be done with an audience of one. Definitely a lot of times in the past before people were more dialed in to the fact that there is something tremendously evil going on in this country. And our feds are not interested in discovering that evil because they are a part of the evil. I think we all accept that. Not just in this country—worldwide, right? There's something about the Charlie (Charlie Kirk) assassination that we spiritually already recognize has international implications. That's very clear.
