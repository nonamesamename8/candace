## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The holidays are going to be here much faster than we realized. So call their salary-based mortgage consultants today. You can call American Financing at 800-795-1210. Again, that's 800-795-1210 or visit americanfinancing.net/Owens—americanfinancing.net/Owens. Well, Turning Point USA is finally dropping some receipts. Kind of—not really—but it's more than we've received thus far, which is nothing, so it's something. And it's not at all what we were asking for, but again, I want to be optimistic, so at least it's something.
