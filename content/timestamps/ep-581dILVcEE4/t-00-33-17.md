So I was not with Mikey, or I don't remember being with him. I think I was ahead of him as we left, and we get out, and I run for —it must have been more than 15 or 20 seconds. And then I realized there hasn't been another shot, so the shooter has likely been detained or stopped or something—not in immediate danger. I pause; I look around me; and I see Mikey. And I see Mikey there. And I'll never—truthfully, I will never forget what I saw because I've seen Mikey almost every day for the past two years. I know his personality very well.
