## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> And I want you to imagine a world where Calvary Chapel churches get to decide how we're educated because somebody sent me an actual magazine that they have. Again, I'm new to the Calvary Chapel thing that's happening. I knew they were behind a lot of the attacks against me and Tucker (Tucker Carlson) this year, but I hadn't realized how—like I said—naked in propaganda this is. This is this month's issue of Calvary Chapel magazine. Apparently they have their own magazine. And this is not parody. This is "Judeo Christianity." This is the cover of Calvary Chapel magazine from this month. And it says, "Stand with Israel." It tells the story of "surfer to shepherd." I guess that's somebody's story. And then you have there a subtitle.
