## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> All right, you guys, happy Tuesday. Rob McCoy, America's pastor. Remember, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) told him. Charlie (Charlie Kirk) told me I was America's pastor. Well, it sure as heck seems that this American pastor travels to Israel a lot. You know, a lot of these American pastors do. And he went there the other day to, of course, honor Charlie (Charlie Kirk). We're going to talk about that. And I want to just say Zionists are confusing at best. They say Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was their bestest friend forever and ever. Yet for whatever reason, they are deeply upset by this investigation. They are deeply upset that we revealed the license plate numbers associated with the Egyptian frequent flyers.
