## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> I did see that the Daily Mail broke the story about the life insurance policy that was taken out. I mean, some of that obviously is normal. to have life insurance policy if you are married to somebody, whether or not there were corporate implications is a whole other ballpark question. By the way, that also could be normal as well. So I try not to speak about things that I'm not too educated about, but I have asked some questions and hopefully I can supply some answers. Also, it has similarly been going viral this weekend, which I didn't get to. People that are saying that Charlie Kirk has not yet been buried yet. I told you that he had a Catholic funeral mass. And so some people were tagging me in that.
