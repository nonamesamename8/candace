## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I find it very odd that I said that I had proof that the government of France was involved in Charlie Kirk's assassination, that they were on the ground that day. And you have not reached out to me. In this very interview that you are asserting that you are certain that Tyler Robinson is the only person involved, how can you be certain if you are not reaching out to people that claim to have verifiable evidence which could dispute that narrative? Does it seem to you like he's telling the truth there? Does it seem to you like he's being open and he's being transparent or does it seem like he's intentionally being cagey because he knows that I am telling the truth despite the many millions of dollars that is being spent on this Operation Mockingbird 2.0 campaign.
