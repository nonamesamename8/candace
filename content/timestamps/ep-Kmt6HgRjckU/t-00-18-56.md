## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> behaving in ways that indicated that they wanted to cover this up, that they were not interested in getting to the bottom of this, everybody woke up. Everybody is awake in the whole world right now that there is something much more far reaching and nefarious that is going on. And trafficking is definitively to me a plausibility because I believe that if you are an entrepreneur and you become successful in this country, meritocracy, we do not live in. No, I believe Tucker (Tucker Carlson) was right when he called that out on stage and started asking about how we people become billionaires. I believe that you, when you get to a certain level, have to decide whether you are going to join the gang.
