## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> When I say high reaching, as in like the president of France at that time was implicated via his son who was involved in this. Basically, everyone was getting paid off of this ends up being 41 politicians involved, multiple states and of course, multiple nations that are involved, including Angola. But you should know the scandal also touched the United States. Human rights groups demanded that Congress also probe the Bush administration's involvement because they claim they did a deal and got involved for oil. Of course, why do we have wars? Because they can go in and they can steal a country's resources. I hope you are awake to that by now.
