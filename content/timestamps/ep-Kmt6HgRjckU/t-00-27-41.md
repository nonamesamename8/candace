## Transcript

**Milo Yiannopoulos:**
> I agree with all of this. That is the moment Trumpism died. I agree. And don't we need a reckoning? And if that reckoning comes through the obviously, I promise I'm nearly done, the obviously inadequate account from the feds and Turning Point about what happened around, before and after Charlie Kirk's death, where his ride or die homegirl is asking questions that have have exposed some inconsistencies and some questions, and which seem to point to a different etiology for the crime than the one that we're being told. And when everybody from Turning Point looks so sinister, suspicious, and guilty all the time, and they're losing to her, respect the public on that at least, they're losing to her, and they have every reason to be winning.
