## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And I do have more to say about that and I will use tomorrow to do so, but yeah, I did see that going viral and I did not ignore that. I was... checking some things. And yeah, stay tuned for tomorrow. By the way, if you want to support the show, you can obviously head to CandaceOwens.com, buy some merch. You can also go to MakeHimASandwich.com and buy direct from us to get our book. It'll be 20% cheaper than if you get it on Amazon, but that might be more convenient for you. So you can go on to Amazon and buy Make Him A Sandwich. No matter what you do, we appreciate the support as we maintain our independence because We don't want to pledge no gangs, man. I'm not here for gang culture, and I'm sorry.
