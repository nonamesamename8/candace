## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Laughing Cats Music World writes, Could you please draft a strong post to TPUSA asking the questions that we all want answers to? Why $1.5 million was sent to a 110 LLC, which routes to a Safeway strip mall? Why is the Doge audit suddenly no longer happening? Can we see Mikey (Mikey McCoy)'s call logs and the metadata before and after 12.23 p.m.? Much more. And fam, follow John Mappen and read his essay, The Perfumed Pervert. Look, they have said they're going to be doing something in the near future to answer questions and I would imagine that if they said if it's once and for all, these would be some of the questions that are going to have to be answered or it won't be for all, right?
