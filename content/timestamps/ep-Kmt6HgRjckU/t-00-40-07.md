## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Sweet Jesus, help us to save our nation. I mean, if they want to keep their jobs, they'd have to stay silent. But obviously, a lot of leaks that we've received have come from TPUSA employees. So they are doing the right thing. And that's why we shouldn't discount that there are good people that are in that organization. Corruption everywhere, whether it's the government, whether it's at a big corporation, it tends to happen at the top because only the top has the power to be corrupt, right? If you're on the bottom and you're doing something wrong, they're just going to fire you. AZ Master Baker writes Erica with Barry Weiss on the 13th. I think that's this month. TP USA podcast to debunk things scheduled for the 15th. TP USA Amfest on the 18th. Nothing is a coincidence. They want to squash all of this by Amfest. I'm sure
