## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Thank you, Charlie Kirk, for reminding us that you had common sense, that you didn't accept force-fed narratives, that you did not accept the BS crap that our government has sold us regarding the one individual that was involved in JFK's assassination. Of course, multiple people were involved and a lot of strange things occurred on that day. That is what makes his answer there so compelling, okay? Especially in the midst of, well, MKUltra 2.0. Remember the first government psyop on the people, MKUltra, what actually came together, sorry, I should say Mockingbird 2.0.
