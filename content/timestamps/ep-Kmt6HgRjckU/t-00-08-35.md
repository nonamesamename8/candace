## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Do you want to involve me in you looking at it? Because actually it kind of left me on read. There has been no communication with the FBI. You are aware right there, Megyn Kelly is asking you directly about it. So you can't pretend you didn't receive it. And you are choosing to skip over. He completely skips over the part about me having asserted, which Megyn asks him directly, you know, was France involved in trial for assassination? He doesn't even address that. Skips right over it and instead says, if any American has a threat, that's what we're here for. And she's like, okay, but was there actually a threat? If anybody, let's just kind of make it, say it more broadly, we will take it seriously. Well, you're not doing that, Kash (Kash Patel).
