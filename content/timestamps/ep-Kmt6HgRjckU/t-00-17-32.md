## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Now, according to my sources in France, they say that the people of France were absolutely outraged. They found this to be naked corruption when he won his appeal. And then afterwards, Pierre Faucon just disappeared into thin air, disappeared from France because as it turns out, he actually reappeared in Scottsdale. And what he's been doing since is anybody's guess, but we had some tips. Which I'd like to pursue further, since, again, this is in he is in Scottsdale, and we know that turning point is very much involved in politics in Scottsdale, as to whether or not he still has a. a foot in politics?
