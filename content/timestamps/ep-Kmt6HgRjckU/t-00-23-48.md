## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Because people don't question when there's tons of trucks coming in. Like if it's a Taylor Swift concert, no one's gonna question if there's tons of jets that are coming in and there's tons of trucks that are coming in. You just go, this must all be for the big show.

And companies that have a lot of events probably provide a pretty sound opportunity for people who are interested in those sorts of things to do that. I'm thinking about that now a lot. What's happening on the Operation Mockingbird 2.0 side is now they are all blaming me for the upcoming midterms. We're not going to win midterms.
