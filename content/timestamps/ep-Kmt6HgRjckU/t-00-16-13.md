## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Everything that's being sold to you fighting for their power, fighting for their rights, Muslims versus Christians, wealthy bankers that want resources, okay? I'm reading this Bush component from a website that's known as CorpWatch, and it tells us that, quote, known as Angola Gate, in France, the scandal involves arms for oil deals between French businessman Pierre Falcone, the head of a firm, that was called Branko International, his colleague Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, the son of the former French president, and a Russian-born Israeli named Arkady Gaidemach.
