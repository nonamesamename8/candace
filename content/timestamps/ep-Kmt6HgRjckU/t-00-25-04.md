## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> lost a bunch of subscribers to his show because he attacked me, even though I never attacked him back, but he didn't put two and two together, which would imply that that means that people who were watching your show were also watching my show.

And he's come up with a way more compelling understanding, which is how we're all feeling. the person to blame if Trump (Donald Trump) loses midterms, if Republicans lose midterms, might be Republicans. It might be Trump.
