## Transcript

**George Santos:**
> Everybody except George, of course. No, that's not true. There's so many people. I voted for Trump (Donald Trump) for many other reasons other than that. Stop it. Stop it. Grow up. You think that puts food on the table? Grow up. Oh, it's about egg prices. Stop it. Come on. Part of the reason that Trump (Donald Trump) was elected in 2016 was that Hillary Clinton was emblematic of the way that the world was going wrong. The secret, elite, collusion, Epstein. It was all linked. And people who voted for him the first time and people who voted for him every time since. You can't find me someone apart from George, apparently, who did not want to see the Epstein files. Let me ask you. I promise I'll wrap up and let someone else go. But when he said there's no Epstein files and then The Democrats made it up. And then, stop asking.
