## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> The first government psyop on the people following JFK's assassination, Mockingbird 1.0, to convince everybody through influence that there was nothing to see here, even though there was so much to see there. And now it's being deployed again, Mockingbird, Operation Mockingbird 2.0, to convince people that questions about the Charlie Kirk narrative are just crazy. How dare you consider that there may have been employees at Turning Point USA who could be engaged in an obvious cover up at this moment? Well, Frank (Frank Turek) says that's so crazy because that would mean that Charlie Kirk hired people that ultimately betrayed him. And no one's ever been betrayed by people that they trust in the history of the world.
