## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> It's never gonna happen. It's just never going to happen. And so at some point they are going to either just, I don't know, have to declare war on the American people. Like nevermind, nevermind. We're just gonna go to war with you because you won't accept it. or they're gonna have to give us something that's truthful. Somebody is going to have to come forward and say something that makes sense. And because I believe that this conspiracy is so far reaching, because I believe it is exactly like the JFK assassination and people close to Charlie are aware of things that they sold him out in many ways every single day that goes by where they don't tell us the truth and they're not honest about the anxiety that Charlie had the night before he died. They look more and more guilty.
