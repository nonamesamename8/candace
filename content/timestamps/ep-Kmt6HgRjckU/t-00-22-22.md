## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Also, telling you guys again about pre-born because when we see people that are doubling down on abortion, we have to double down on supporting life. Through our partnership with Preborn, we can help save babies and support mothers that are in need because every day, Preborn's clinics are rescuing hundreds of babies because when a mother sees her baby on an ultrasound and hears that tiny heartbeat, her chance of choosing life doubles. And now, thanks to a generous match, your gift can be doubled as well. That means twice as many ultrasounds, twice as many lives saved, and twice as many mothers that are given hope. They also get diapers, car seats. They provide counseling to those mothers and care for up to two years. So if you've heard about Preborn before and have not yet taken action, there is no better time than right now.
