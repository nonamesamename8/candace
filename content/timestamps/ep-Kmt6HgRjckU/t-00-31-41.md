## Transcript

**Jesse (Ballistics Expert):**
> I actually bought this one specifically for this test just to give us the highest chance of something stopping in the target. Okay this is how we're going to set this one up. I have our ballistic dummy bust on a table in the front. I do have it slightly angled so we can hit the target that we're aiming for. Behind it I have three five gallon water jugs just in case the bullet over penetrates. Maybe we'll get lucky and actually capture it. What I'm going to do is pull my truck back here and try to use the roof to get a slight downward angle on the target just like it was in real life. Unfortunately for this video I'm not going to be able to take the shot at 140 yards. I got too many cameras to operate. I did do that in our first video though if you want to see it I'll link it right here. I just wanted to show you how easy it was and how close that actually is with this caliber. Trust me, it's a chip shot.
