## Transcript

**Jesse (Ballistics Expert):**
> Alright guys, we have a couple different rounds we could use for this test. There is like a thousand .30-06s out there and that's one reason why I wasn't ready to just jump in doubting the story right away because we don't even know what kind of ammo was used. It could literally be anything. So the first one we have is the 180 grain full metal jacket ball round. This is one of the most common .30-06s out there. This and the 150 grain. If you go to a gun shop and just ask for .30-06 ammo, this is probably what they'll give you. If I had to guess, I would honestly say he probably used something like this just because it is the most common round out there. The second one that we have is a lot more interesting. This is the 150 grain Hornady Ballistic Tip.
