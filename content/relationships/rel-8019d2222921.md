- [00:02:14](/episodes/ep-K5GjF53bfN4#t-00-02-14): _What I also don't like are the people like Josh Hammer and Seth Dillon, people that I know who are very nasty and work behind the scenes. I don't like that they have not yet been honest or forthcoming about the pressure that they and others were putting on Charlie (Charlie Kirk)._
