> I learned that oddly, Duncan Aviation—you know, where that plane was transponding from, the FBO in Provo—sourced rental cars for these quote-unquote Egyptians when they landed a couple of days before this operation. I didn't just learn that; I actually have the license plate numbers for four of the vehicles that they rented.
