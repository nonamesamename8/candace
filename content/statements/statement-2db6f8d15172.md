> In fact, the individual who filmed the footage of the shooter on the roof—the lone video that exists of the shooter on the roof—also told me that he doesn't think that Tyler Robinson is the guy. So how's that gonna work for an eyewitness account? When he reported the shooter on the roof to Utah on the campus, he was clear that the person was wearing an entirely different outfit than the ones that they're currently trying to claim that Tyler wore on that day.
