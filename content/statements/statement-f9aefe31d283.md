> This letter that he wrote to the prime minister, Chris—I read back in June or July or so. And there were so many people in the aftermath of his horrific assassination—Candace Owens, folks like that—who were saying that, oh, Charlie (Charlie Kirk) was turning on Israel. He was ready to sell them out and renounce his life's work of sincere and genuine friendship with the Jewish people and the Jewish state. But this letter that he wrote to Bibi (Benjamin Netanyahu) Netanyahu, Chris—literally begins—the first sentence of the letter is (I'm paraphrasing here, but it's a close paraphrase), 'As a Christian, one of my greatest joys in life is making friendships with the Jewish people and defending the state of Israel.'
