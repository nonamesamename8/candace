> What we can however deduce is that Walid Mahmoud is therefore not the president of Egypt, but he is almost certainly well-acquainted with the president of Egypt because planes that fly presidents around—military planes—you're not gonna just let some random wealthy Egyptian aboard your jet, right? This person is going to be well-acquainted with the president of Egypt, okay?
