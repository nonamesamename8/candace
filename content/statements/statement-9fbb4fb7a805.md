> Second thing about Sherry Steele is I can't find her. We stalked; we looked through databases; we contacted Lance's family to see if they're familiar with that name. I cannot find a woman named Sherry Steele that lives in that building complex, nor can I find her alleged footage that the BBC mentions the following morning.
