> Specifically, Walid Mahmood came to Provo on May 27th of this year. Walid Mahmood came in, and we can also confirm that if you look up the plane that he was on, there is no transponder data which reflects that trip. He was not on the yellow plane. This is what's very interesting. He was aboard another Egyptian military plane, and the tail number for that plane is SUBTU.
