> He searched 'best places for a mass shooting.' Here are some of his other Google searches. I think we can just scroll down here. Yeah, okay. And this has a timeline on this. Again, I'm going to probably just post this document because you can handle the truth. He was fascinated with this stuff. He was fascinated. You can see here 'guns versus protesters,' 'Orlando shooting reaction,' 'cars running over protesters,' 'firing an AR-15 as fast as possible,' 'fertilizer bomb,' 'How do you use a tourniquet?' 'How to Molotov cocktail,' 'how to make Molotov cocktails'—pardon me—'mixing gasoline with styrofoam,' 'mass shooting in Canada,' 'Oklahoma bombing,' 'sniper in Dallas shooting.'
