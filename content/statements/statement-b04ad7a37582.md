## Statement

> Before Charlie Kirk died in July, I interviewed Nick Fuentes. Charlie Kirk and I discussed the interview, and never once did he tell me not to speak to Nick Fuentes. Never once did he consider it an act of betrayal. I had a very long discussion with him and with Andrew Kolvet separately, telling them both that Charlie should host Nick Fuentes on his show and debate him. I tried to make that happen.
