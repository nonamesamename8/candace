> Was a large sum of money offered to Charlie (Charlie Kirk) to take Turning Point to the next level—not that it wasn't a very high level—to the next level, with the guarantee that he would represent their current perspectives and the things that were going on, and did Charlie (Charlie Kirk) refuse that? I maintain what I said—that that happened and Charlie (Charlie Kirk) turned the money down.
