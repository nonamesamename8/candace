> My theory is that we are not being told the truth, and I think that there are multiple people that were involved—including George Zinn. That's my overarching theory at the moment: George Zinn with this decoy thing that makes entirely no sense to me. And it will make sense if there's more people that are involved. So I believe that Tyler Robinson played a part. I don't know which part he played.
