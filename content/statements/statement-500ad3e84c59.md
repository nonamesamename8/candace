> somebody who recently got shot accidentally by a .30-06 on a hunting trip sent me a photo to our tips box, and it was shocking. I mean, absolutely shocking. He described the damage that was done and just said, 'In case you want to share with your viewers—in case they actually think that Charlie's neck somehow stopped this.' And I am declining to share that, but I think we can confirm that there was no miracle-bending bullet from the Lozier Center. A smaller weapon was used
