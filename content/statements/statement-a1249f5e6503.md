> I have no donors. He had 00 million worth of donors. And so, because he was involved in a different project from just yapping on the internet—which is what I do for a living—he was dependent to a great extent on his donors. Of course, it's a nonprofit. And they went after him and tormented him—not all, of course; many were supportive—but the ones who were offended by my speech—and there was a small, very intense group who tormented Charlie Kirk until the day he died.
