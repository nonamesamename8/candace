> Seth Dillon of the Babylon Bee, for example. Someone who had his own problems with free speech—who was famously canceled. I like Seth Dillon. I had him on a couple of times. I had dinner with him to show support. Seth Dillon was out there demanding that Charlie Kirk take me off the roster—pull me off stage—because I had said things that Benjamin Netanyahu didn't like or that he didn't like or whatever.
