> I opened the tweets, which went out from Blake Neff around midnight last night. And here's what he wrote. 'The livestream we announced on the show Wednesday has been set. At 4 p.m. Eastern, 2 p.m. local time on Monday, December 15th, a collection of Charlie (Charlie Kirk)'s friends will respond to statements made by Candace Owens to set the record straight once and for all. Prior to the opening of AmericaFest.'
