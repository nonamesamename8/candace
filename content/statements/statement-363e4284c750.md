> The Zionists started circling Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and trying to control things. This was actually in around September or whatever, and I was always very honest that Charlie (Charlie Kirk) and I had a conversation, and they were putting pressure on me. 'You can't talk to her. She's talking about Israel.'
