> They lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and attended a very large Calvary Chapel church there. And they were mentored by a man named Bob Coy. We brought him up yesterday—the pedophile scandal that we mentioned yesterday—who has since been embroiled in scandal for sexual allegations. And I believe had to step down. He mentored them in the process of starting their church in Brentwood, Tennessee.
