> The reason they stripped that and didn't put the date—that it was 2023—is because it destroys the narrative that they're trying to put out: that me and Charlie had a falling out. Because obviously I went on tour with Charlie at the beginning of 2024, and I spoke at their conference in the summer of 2024
