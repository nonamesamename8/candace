> When I started asking, very sensible questions about Israel, as someone who had dedicated her political life to supporting Israel, many times alongside Charlie, I was met with the very same pressure. And just like Charlie was being invited to Israel, I was invited somewhere else. And when this arrived to me, it felt like a threat. It felt like a threat, not like, hey, come here and we can educate you because you're my friend—more like, this is your last chance.
