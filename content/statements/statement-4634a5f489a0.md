> I can tell you that I know Jack Posobiec. He has always been very solid with me. I mean, always. And Jack Posobiec—by the way—every single time that I have been attacked publicly, particularly over the declaration that Christ is King, its like a trigger for Jack Posobiec. He goes hard in the paint.
