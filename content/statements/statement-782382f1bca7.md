> it's not until, by the way, 5:30 p.m.—because he mentioned that second suspect—and he curiously says in that correspondence that he's wearing similar clothing, which I find to be strange. We don't know what that second suspect is wearing until 5:30 p.m., when Governor Cox—12 minutes into a press conference; the press conference began at 5:30 p.m.—mentions that the second suspect, who is a person of interest, is wearing all dark clothing.
