> Charlie Kirk was my friend, and I was his pastor. I want to simply say this regarding Candace Owens. Charlie Kirk was a friend to Candace Owens and never publicly spoke poorly of her, though he disagreed with her. He never operated nor entertained gossip or innuendo concerning Candace Owens. My only comment I offer regarding Candace Owens is this. I only wish at this tragic time of mourning she would be the friend to Charlie Kirk that he was to her.
