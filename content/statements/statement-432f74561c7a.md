> I think that this is a program. I do. I don't know, but I know. You know, I don't know, but I know—because it is giving me the same ick that I had when I was looking through the period and learning the reality of what happened throughout the 1960s when MKUltra—when that program was running. And I have no reason to believe that that program was ever discontinued. And I believe that they find these candidates in schools. I really do.
