> The spokesperson for TPUSA just posted two hours ago that they talked to the coroner and that Charlie Kirk was shot with .30-06 in the left side of his neck and that he's a man of steel and that the bones in his neck that are like chicken bones stopped a bullet that travels 2,500 feet a second out of the barrel... I've shot hogs at 500 yards—.30-06, right to the side. Tiny hole, blows a four-inch hole out to the side... They just said he got shot with a .30-06 and that it didn't go through
