## Statement

> Frank Turek said: 'I have not followed Candace closely. I know she was a good friend of Charlie years ago. Charlie would never speak ill of anybody privately unless he spoke to that person first and tried to correct them. I find this idea that she's making all these suggestions without evidence very painful for people. It's okay to suggest maybe this maybe that but as soon as you start launching accusations TPUSA betrayed Charlie I had a dream that Charlie told me this that's not evidence.'

> And Charlie would never speak ill of anybody privately unless he spoke to that person first and tried to correct them. So Charlie never said anything bad about Candace or anything, but I just find this idea that she's making all these suggestions without evidence very painful for people.
